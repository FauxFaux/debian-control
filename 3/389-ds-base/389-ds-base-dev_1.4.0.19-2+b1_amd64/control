Description: 389 Directory Server suite - development files
 Based on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), the 389
 Directory Server is designed to manage large directories of users and
 resources robustly and scalably.
 .
 This package contains development headers for the core libraries
 of the 389 Directory Server, useful for developing plugins without
 having to install the server itself.
