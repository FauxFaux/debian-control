Description: 3D drawing with MetaPost output -- interpreter
 GNU 3DLDF implements an interpreter for a METAFONT-like language for
 three-dimensional drawing with MetaPost output.
 .
 GNU 3DLDF is mainly intended to provide a convenient way of creating
 3D graphics for inclusion in TeX documents; it can also be used for
 creating animations, which can contain text typeset using TeX.
 .
 This package provides the 3dldf interpreter required to output
 MetaPost source files from ldf ones; it also contains ldf samples.
