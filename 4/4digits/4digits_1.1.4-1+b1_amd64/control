Description: guess-the-number game, aka Bulls and Cows
 4digits is a guess-the-number puzzle game. It's called Bulls and Cows,
 and in China people simply call it Guess-the-Number. The game's
 objective is to guess a four-digit number in 8 tries and the shortest
 time possible. It is similar to Mastermind, but the four digits must
 be unique. 4digits has both a graphical user interface version and
 a command-line version.
