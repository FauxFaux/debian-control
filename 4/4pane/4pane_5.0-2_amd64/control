Description: four-pane detailed-list file manager
 4pane is a dual twin-pane file manager: directories and files are displayed
 in separate panes. By default two pairs of these twin-panes are displayed at
 a time, allowing easy dragging or pasting.
 .
 As well as standard file manager functions, features include support for
 nfs sshfs and samba, archive management including virtual browsing,
 multiple renaming of files, user-defined tools, a terminal emulator, and
 gui access to grep find and locate. Almost all actions, even deletions,
 can be undone and redone.
 .
 4pane aims to be highly configurable, fast and fully-featured without bloat.
