Description: RDF database storage and query engine -- development files
 4store is a database storage and query engine that holds RDF data.

 It does not provide many features over and above RDF storage and SPARQL
 queries, but if your are looking for a scalable, secure, fast and
 efficient RDF store, then 4store should be on your shortlist.
