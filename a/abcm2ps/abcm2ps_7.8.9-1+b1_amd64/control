Description: Translates ABC music description files to PostScript
 This is the Debian port of the abcm2ps program by Jean-Fran√ßois Moine.
 The program translates tunes written in the ABC format to PostScript,
 which can then be viewed using Ghostview et al. or printed on a
 PostScript printer or through Ghostscript. It supports various
 semi-standard extensions to the ABC standard, such as multiple
 voices and staves.
 .
 This program is a vastly improved spin-off from Michael Methfessel's
 abc2ps, which is no longer supplied as part of Debian. In particular,
 it contains a lot of extensions to help typeset classical music.
