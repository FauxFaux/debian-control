Description: converter from ABC to MIDI format and back
 This package contains the programs `abc2midi' and `midi2abc',  which
 convert from the abc musical notation format to standard MIDI format
 and vice-versa. They can generate accompaniment from guitar chords
 in the abc file, as well as insert various MIDI events; the
 MIDI-to-abc translation tries to figure out bars, triplets and
 accidentals on its own.
 .
 The package also contains `abc2abc' (an abc prettyprinter/transposer),
 `mftext' (a program that dumps a MIDI file as text), and `midicopy'
 (a program that extracts specific tracks, channels or time intervals
 from a MIDI file).
 .
 The package also contains Yet another ABC to PostScript converter (yaps)
 which translates tunes written in the ABC format to PostScript,
 which can then be viewed on screen or printed. It is essentially a
 (non-exclusive) alternative to abc2ps, being based on the abc2ps
 PostScript code together with the ABC parser from the abcmidi package.
