Description: tool to compare ABI compatibility of shared C/C++ library versions
 abi-compliance-checker can be used to help reduce the possibility of
 an application crashing when the shared libraries it links against
 have changed.  Signatures and data type definitions from two separate
 versions of a library are compared by examining the shared objects
 (.so) files themselves, and by analysing the header files (.h)
 provided for the two versions of the library and their dependencies.
 .
 Shared library developers trying to strive for binary compatibility
 between releases may also use this tool to detect if an any
 accidental application binary interface (ABI) changes have been
 introduced.
 .
 The checker may also be used for assessing binary compatibility
 between different Linux distributions.
