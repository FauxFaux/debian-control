Description: visualize ABI changes of a C/C++ library
 abi-tracker generates an ABI (Application Binary Interface) compatibility
 report for a C or C++ library. The report gets rendered to static HTML pages.
 .
 The tool is intended for developers of software libraries and Linux
 maintainers who are interested in ensuring backward binary compatibility,
 i.e. allow old applications to run with newer library versions.
 .
 abi-tracker requires an input profile for the library in JSON format,
 which holds various metadata to check ABI compatibility.
 It can be created manually or automatically generated by the abi-monitor tool.
