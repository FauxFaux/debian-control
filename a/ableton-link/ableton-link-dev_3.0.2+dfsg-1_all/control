Description: synchronizes musical applications on multiple devices - development
 Ableton Link, a technology that synchronizes musical beat, tempo, and phase
 across multiple applications running on one or more devices. Applications on
 devices connected to a local network discover each other automatically and form
 a musical session in which each participant can perform independently: anyone
 can start or stop while still staying in time. Anyone can change the tempo, the
 others will follow. Anyone can join or leave without disrupting the session.
 .
 Ableton Link is implemented as a header-only C++-library.
 This package contains the development files.
