Description: Maven plugin for custom access modifier checking
 This maven plugin allows applications to define custom
 access modifiers programmatically, to be enforced at
 compile time in the opt-in basis. Obviously, there's no
 runtime check either --- this is strictly a voluntary
 annotation.
 .
 This mechanism is useful for actually making sure that
 deprecated features are not used (without actually removing
 such declarations, which would break binary compatibility.)
