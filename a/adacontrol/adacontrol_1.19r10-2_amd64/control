Description: Ada rules controller
 AdaControl verifies that Ada software meets the requirements of a
 number of parameterizable rules.  It is not intended to supplement
 checks made by the compiler, but rather to search for particular
 violations of good-practice rules, or to check that some rules are
 obeyed project-wide.
 .

 .
  * pfni: Print Full Name Image - expands any identifier to a fully-qualified
    name
