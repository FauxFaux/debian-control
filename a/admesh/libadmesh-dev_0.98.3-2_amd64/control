Description: Tool for processing triangulated solid meshes. Development files
 Currently, ADMesh only reads the STL file
 format that is used for rapid prototyping applications,
 although it can write STL, VRML, OFF, and DXF files.
 Some features of admesh are: Fill holes in the mesh
 by adding facets. Repair facets by connecting
 nearby facets. Repair normal directions
 (i.e. facets should be CCW) Remove degenerate
 facets (i.e. facets with 2 or more vertices equal)
 .
 The package contains development files.
