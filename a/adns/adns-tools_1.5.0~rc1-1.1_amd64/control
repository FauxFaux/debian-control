Description: Asynchronous-capable DNS client utilities
 adns is a DNS resolver.  In contrast with many existing interfaces,
 gethostbyname et al and libresolv, it can be used in an asynchronous,
 non-blocking manner.  Many queries can be handled simultaneously.
 .
 This package contains useful utilities for IP address resolving,
 fast bulk logfile processing, and testing.
