Description: Asynchronous-capable DNS client library (development)
 adns is a resolver library for C (and C++) programs.  In contrast
 with many existing interfaces, it can be used in an asynchronous,
 non-blocking manner, and has a convenient interface which doesn't
 require the application to handle any DNS data formats.  Many queries
 can be handled simultaneously.
 .
 This package contains the development files used for C/C++ programs.
