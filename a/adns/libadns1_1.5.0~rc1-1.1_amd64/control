Description: Asynchronous-capable DNS client library
 adns is a resolver library for C (and C++) programs.  In contrast
 with the existing interfaces, gethostbyname et al and libresolv, it
 can be used in an asynchronous, non-blocking manner, and has a
 convenient interface which doesn't require the application to handle
 any DNS data formats.  Many queries can be handled simultaneously.
 .
 This package contains the runtime library.
