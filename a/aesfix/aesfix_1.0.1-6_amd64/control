Description: tool for correcting bit errors in an AES key schedule
 This program illustrates a technique for correcting bit errors in an AES
 key schedule. It should be used with the output of the aeskeyfind program.
 .
 It is limited to AES-128 key schedules, and it can only correct unidirectional
 1->0 bit errors.  For the most part it has been optimized for readability
 rather than performance.
 .
 This package is useful to several activities, as forensics investigations.
