Description: tool for locating AES keys in a captured memory image
 This program illustrates automatic techniques for locating 128-bit and
 256-bit AES keys in a captured memory image.
 .
 The program uses various algorithms and also performs a simple entropy
 test to filter out blocks that are not keys.  It counts the number of
 repeated bytes and skips blocks that have too many repeats.
 .
 This method works even if several bits of the key schedule have been
 corrupted due to memory decay.
 .
 This package is useful to several activities, as forensics investigations.
