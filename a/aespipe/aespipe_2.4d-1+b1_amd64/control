Description: AES-encryption tool with loop-AES support
 aespipe is an encryption tool that reads from standard input and
 writes to standard output. It uses the AES (Rijndael) cipher.
 .
 aespipe can be used for non-destructive in-place encryption
 of existing disk partitions for use with the loop-AES encrypted
 loopback kernel module.
 .
 It can also be used as an encryption filter to create and restore
 encrypted tar/cpio backup archives and to read/write and convert
 loop-AES compatible encrypted images.
 .
 Note that aespipe does not store any length information with the
 encrypted images, so it cannot be used as general purpose filter
 for encryption, but only for certain formats like tar.
