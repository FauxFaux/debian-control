Description: utilities to complement a minimal window manager
 These utilities were previously supplied with aewm++; they are intended
 to provide some of the typical desktop functionality that aewm++ itself
 does not include. This package provides:
  * aewm++_appbar: a small application launcher
  * aewm++_fspanel: a very small panel
  * aewm++_setrootimage: draws a gradient on the X root window
  * aewm++_xsession: keeps an X session alive
 Note that some of these were named differently in previous releases.
