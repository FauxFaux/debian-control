Description: minimal window manager written in C++
 aewm++ is a minimal window manager for X11, based on aewm. It keeps aewm's
 minimalist look and feel but is written in C++, and adds some modern features
 like virtual desktops. GNOME EWMH hints have been removed in this release,
 because upstream wants to focus on making the code stable and minimalistic.
 .
 This package used to include appbar, aewm++_fspanel, setrootimage and
 aewm++_xsession; these can now be found in the aewm++-goodies package.
