Description: minimalist window manager for X11
 aewm is a minimalist window manager for X11. It has no nifty
 features, but is light on resources and extremely simple in
 appearance. It should eventually make a good reference implementation
 of the ICCCM. A few separate programs are included to handle running
 programs, switching between windows, etc.
