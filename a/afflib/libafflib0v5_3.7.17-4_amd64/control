 The Advanced Forensic Format (AFF) is on-disk format for storing
 computer forensic information. Critical features of AFF include:
 .
  - AFF allows you to store both computer forensic data and associated
    metadata in one or more files.
  - AFF allows files to be digital signed, to provide for
    chain-of-custody and long-term file integrity.
  - AFF allows for forensic disk images to stored encrypted and
    decrypted on-the-fly for processing. This allows disk images
    containing privacy sensitive material to be stored on the Internet.
