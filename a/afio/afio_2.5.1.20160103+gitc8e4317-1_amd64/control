Description: archive file manipulation program
 Afio manipulates groups of files, copying them within or between
 filesystems and an afio archive.
 .
 Afio archives are portable as they contain only ASCII-formatted header
 information. Afio makes cpio-format archives.  Afio deals somewhat
 gracefully with input data corruption.  Afio supports multi-volume
 archives during interactive operation.  Afio can make compressed
 archives that are much safer than compressed tar or cpio archives.
 .
 Afio is best used as an `archive engine' in a backup script.
