Description: code coverage for afl (American Fuzzy Lop)
 afl-cov uses test cases produced by the fuzzer afl to produce gcov code
 coverage results (what parts of program are actually executed) of the
 targeted binary.
 .
 afl-cov can be used to analyze the test results of afl after fuzzing has
 been completed. However, a typical workflow is to run afl-cov while afl-fuzz
 builds test cases during the fuzzing cycle runs on the same system, and to
 review the cumulative code coverage results.
 .
 Analyzing code coverage results of afl test cases can help to maximize its
 effectiveness, e.g. when its needed to patch the project code to help the
 fuzzer to reach code that would be otherwise inaccessible.
