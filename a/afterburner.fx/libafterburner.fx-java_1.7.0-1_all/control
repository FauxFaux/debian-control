Description: minimalistic JavaFX MVP framework
 afterburner.fx is a minimalistic JavaFX MVP framework based on Convention
 over Configuration and Dependency Injection, providing the following:
 .
  - "Zero-Configuration" javax.inject.Inject DI of models or services
    into presenters.
  - Convention-based unification of presenter, view, FXML and css.
  - Conventional resource bundle loading.
  - Injection of System.getProperties.
  - Injection of presenter-local configuration properties (system
    properties are overriding the local configuration).
 .
 Afterburner is a "Just-Enough-Framework" extracted from
 airhacks-control and used in airpad, lightfish and floyd applications.
