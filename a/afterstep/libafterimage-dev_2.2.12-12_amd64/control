Description: imaging library designed for AfterStep - development files
 libAfterImage is the imaging library implemented for AfterStep
 X Window Manager. It has been generalized to be suitable for any
 application in need of robust graphics engine.
 .
 It provides facilities for loading images from files of different
 formats, compressed in memory storage of images, scaling,
 tinting/shading, flipping and superimposition of arbitrary number of
 images over each other. In addition it allows for linear gradients
 drawing, and antialiased/smoothed text drawing using both  FreeType
 library and X Window fonts.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static library needed to
 compile applications that use libAfterImage.
