Description: shared libraries for the AfterStep window manager
 AfterStep is a window manager based on FVWM which attempts to emulate
 the NEXTSTEP look and feel, while retaining the configurability of its
 predecessor.  Note that this window manager makes extensive use of the
 color palette.  If you have only an 8-bit color display, it will run
 as packaged, but you may want to modify the configuration to use fewer
 colors.
 .
 This package contains runtime libraries needed by AfterStep.
