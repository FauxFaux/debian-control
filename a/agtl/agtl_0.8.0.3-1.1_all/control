Description: Tool for paperless geocaching
 AGTL downloads cache locations in the area visible on the map
 including their description, hints, difficulty levels and images.
 Searching for caches in your local db is a matter of seconds.
 The currently selected cache is shown on the map (and also all
 the others if you want) and there's a traditional compass-like
 view that always points at the cache.
