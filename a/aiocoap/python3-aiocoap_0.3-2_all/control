Description: Python implementation of CoAP
 The aiocoap package is a Python implementation of CoAP, the Constrained
 Application Protocol (RFC 7252, more info at http://coap.technology/).

 It uses the asyncio module introduced in Python 3.4 to facilitate concurrent
 operations while maintaining a simple to use interface and not depending on
 anything outside the standard library.
