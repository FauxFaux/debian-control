Description: configuration and management utilities for Apple AirPort base stations
 This package contains various utilities to manage the Apple AirPort base
 stations.

 Be aware that Apple released several versions of the AirPort base station;
 the original AirPort ("Graphite") was a rebranded Lucent RG-1000 base
 station, doing 802.11a/b. The AirPort Extreme ("Snow") is an Apple-built
 802.11a/b/g base station.

     link quality between the base station and the associated hosts

    modem connections, displays the approximate connection time (Extreme only)
