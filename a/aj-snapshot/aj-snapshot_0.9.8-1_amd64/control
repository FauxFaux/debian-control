Description: make snapshots of JACK connections
 Aj-snapshot is a small program that can be used to make snapshots
 of the connections made between JACK and/or ALSA clients. Because
 JACK can provide both audio and MIDI support to programs,
 aj-snapshot can store both types of connections for JACK. ALSA,
 on the other hand, only provides routing facilities for MIDI clients.
 Aj-snapshot is meant to be used from the command line.
