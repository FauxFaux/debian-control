Description: dark and light GTK+ theme from the Shimmer Project
 Albatross was the default theme for Xubuntu 9.10 and 10.04 LTS. Albatross
 uses dark menus but light-colored content areas. The Shimmer Project are
 the designers and developers of this theme.
 .
 Albatross works best in Xfce since it currently has incomplete support
 for newer versions of GTK+ 3.
