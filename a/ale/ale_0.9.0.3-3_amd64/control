Description: synthetic capture engine and renderer
 ALE aligns and merges several similar images from a digitizing device
 (such as a digital camera or scanner) into a single image.  This operation
 can create a higher fidelity image by using details from several separate
 images combined into the final image. It can also be used to merge the
 images into a mosaic or panoramic image.
