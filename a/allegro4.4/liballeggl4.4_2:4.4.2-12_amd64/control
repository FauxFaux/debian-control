Description: library to mix OpenGL graphics with Allegro routines
 AllegroGL is an Allegro add-on that allows you to use OpenGL alongside
 Allegro -- you use OpenGL for your rendering to the screen, and Allegro for
 miscellaneous tasks like gathering input, doing timers, getting cross-platform
 portability, loading data, and drawing your textures. So this library fills
 the same hole that things like glut do.
 .
 AllegroGL also automatically exposes most, if not all, OpenGL extensions
 available to user programs. This means you no longer have to manually load
 them; extension management is already done for you.
 .
 Allegro is a cross-platform library mainly aimed at video game and multimedia
 programming. It handles common, low-level tasks such as creating windows,
 accepting user input, loading data, drawing images, playing sounds, etc. and
 generally abstracting away the underlying platform.
