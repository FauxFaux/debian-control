Description: portable library for cross-platform game and multimedia development
 Allegro is a cross-platform library mainly aimed at video game and multimedia
 programming. It handles common, low-level tasks such as creating windows,
 accepting user input, loading data, drawing images, playing sounds, etc. and
 generally abstracting away the underlying platform.
