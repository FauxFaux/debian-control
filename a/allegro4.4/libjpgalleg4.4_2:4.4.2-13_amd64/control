Description: JPG loading addon for Allegro 4
 This add-on for Allegro will allow you to load and save JPG images using
 standard Allegro image handling functions as if they were normal bitmaps.
 .
 Allegro is a cross-platform library mainly aimed at video game and multimedia
 programming. It handles common, low-level tasks such as creating windows,
 accepting user input, loading data, drawing images, playing sounds, etc. and
 generally abstracting away the underlying platform.
