Description: OGG loading addon for Allegro 4
 liblogg is an Allegro add-on library for playing OGG/Vorbis audio files.
 It can load OGG/Vorbis files as Allegro SAMPLE's, or it can stream them
 from disk to save memory.
 .
 Allegro is a cross-platform library mainly aimed at video game and multimedia
 programming. It handles common, low-level tasks such as creating windows,
 accepting user input, loading data, drawing images, playing sounds, etc. and
 generally abstracting away the underlying platform.
