Description: audio codec addon for the Allegro 5 library
 This package provides the audio codec addon for the Allegro 5 library.
 This addon allows you to load audio sample formats.
 .
 Allegro is a cross-platform library intended for use in computer games
 and other types of multimedia programming. Allegro 5 is the latest major
 revision of the library, designed to take advantage of modern hardware
 (e.g. hardware acceleration using 3D cards) and operating systems.
 Although it is not backwards compatible with earlier versions, it still
 occupies the same niche and retains a familiar style.
