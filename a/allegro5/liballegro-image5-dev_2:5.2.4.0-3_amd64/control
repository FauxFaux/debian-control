Description: header files for the Allegro 5 image addon
 This package is required to build programs that use the Allegro 5 image
 addon.
 .
 Allegro is a cross-platform library intended for use in computer games
 and other types of multimedia programming. Allegro 5 is the latest major
 revision of the library, designed to take advantage of modern hardware
 (e.g. hardware acceleration using 3D cards) and operating systems.
 Although it is not backwards compatible with earlier versions, it still
 occupies the same niche and retains a familiar style.
