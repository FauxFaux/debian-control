Description: Simple file browser from Alpine, a text-based email client
 "pilot" is a simple file browser from Alpine.  It is used in Alpine to
 let the user select attachments.  As with (Al)pine, commands are displayed
 at the bottom of the screen, and context-sensitive help is provided.

 As a stand-alone program, it is useful as a basic file browser, filling the
 same utility as programs like the midnight commander.
