Description: equalizer plugin for ALSA
 Alsaequal is a real-time adjustable equalizer plugin for ALSA. It can
 be adjusted using an ALSA compatible mixer, like alsamixergui or
 alsamixer.

 Alsaequal uses the Eq CAPS LADSPA Plugin for audio processing, actually
 alsaequal is a generic LADSPA plugin interface with real-time access to
 the LADSPA controls (the LADSPA plugin included with alsa doesn't allow
 for real-time controls) but it was developed for and only tested with
 Eq CAPS LADSPA plugin.
