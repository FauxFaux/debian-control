Description: graphical soundcard mixer for ALSA soundcard driver
 alsamixergui is an FLTK based mixer program for use with the ALSA soundcard
 drivers. It supports multiple soundcards with multiple devices.
 .
 alsamixergui is a frontend for alsamixer, written directly on top of the
 alsamixer source, leaving the original source intact, only adding a couple of
 ifdefs, and some calls to the gui part. It provides exactly the same
 functionality, but with a graphical user interface.
