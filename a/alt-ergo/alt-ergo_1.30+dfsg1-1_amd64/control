Description: Automatic theorem prover dedicated to program verification
 Alt-Ergo is an automatic theorem prover geared towards application in
 program verification. It is based on CC(X), a congruence closure
 algorithm parameterized by an equational theory X. Alt-Ergo has
 built-in provers for propositional logic, linear arithmetic,
 uninterpreted function symbols, associative-commutative function
 symbols, polymorphic arrays, user-defined polymorphic record types
 and polymorphic enumeration types. It has restricted support for
 reasoning over arbitrary user-defined algebraic types, first-order
 quantifiers, and non-linear arithmetic.
 .
 This package contains the prover as a command-line executable
 as well as the graphical interface.
