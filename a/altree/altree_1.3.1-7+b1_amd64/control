Description: program to perform phylogeny-based association and localization analysis
 ALTree was designed to perform association detection and localization of
 susceptibility sites using haplotype phylogenetic trees: first, it allows the
 detection of an association between a candidate gene and a disease, and second,
 it enables to make hypothesis about the susceptibility loci.
