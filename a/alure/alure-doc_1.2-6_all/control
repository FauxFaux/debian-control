Description: AL Utilities REtooled (documentation)
 ALURE is a utility library to help manage common tasks with OpenAL
 applications. This includes device enumeration and initialization, file
 loading, and streaming.
 .
 The purpose of this library is to provide pre-made functionality that would
 otherwise be repetitive or difficult to (re)code for various projects and
 platforms, such as loading a sound file into an OpenAL buffer and streaming an
 audio file through a buffer queue. Support for different formats is consistant
 across platforms, so no special checks are needed when loading files, and all
 formats are handled through the same API.
 .
 Currently ALURE includes a basic .wav and .aif file reader, and can leverage
 external libraries such as libSndFile (for extended wave formats and several
 others), VorbisFile (for Ogg Vorbis), and FLAC (for FLAC and Ogg FLAC), and
 others. External libraries can also be dynamically loaded at run-time, or
 individually disabled outright at compile time.
 .
 This package installs the ALURE documentation.
