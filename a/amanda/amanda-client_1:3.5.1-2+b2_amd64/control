Description: Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver (Client)
 Amanda is a backup system designed to archive many computers on a
 network to a single large-capacity tape drive. This package is
 suitable for large amounts of data to backup. For smaller solutions
 take a look at afbackup, tob, ...
 .
  Features:
   * will back up multiple machines in parallel to a holding disk, blasting
     finished dumps one by one to tape as fast as they can be can written to
     tape.  For example, a ~2 Gb 8mm tape on a ~240K/s interface to a host
     with a large holding disk can be filled by Amanda in under 4 hours.
   * built on top of standard backup software: Unix dump/restore, and
     later GNU Tar and others.
   * does simple tape management: will not overwrite the wrong tape.
   * supports tape changers via a generic interface.  Easily customizable
     to any type of tape carousel, robot, or stacker that can be controlled
     via the unix command line.
   * for a restore, tells you what tapes you need, and finds the proper
     backup image on the tape for you.
   * recovers gracefully from errors, including down or hung machines.
   * reports results, including all errors in detail, in email to operators.
   * will dynamically adjust backup schedule to keep within constraints:
     no more juggling by hand when adding disks and computers to network.
   * includes a pre-run checker program, that conducts sanity checks on both
     the tape server host and all the client hosts (in parallel), and will
     send an e-mail report of any problems that could cause the backups to
     fail.
   * can compress dumps before sending or after sending over the net, with
     either compress or gzip.
   * can optionally synchronize with external backups, for those large
     timesharing computers where you want to do full dumps when the system
     is down in single-user mode (since BSD dump is not reliable on active
     filesystems): Amanda will still do your daily dumps.
   * lots of other options; Amanda is very configurable.
