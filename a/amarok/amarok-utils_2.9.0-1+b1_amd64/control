Description: utilities for Amarok media player
 This package contains command line utilities that are typically used by Amarok
 media player but might also be useful on systems without Amarok installed.
 They are designed to be lightweight as they do not depend on KDE libraries.
 .
 Currently the package contains the following utilities:
   - amarokcollectionscanner - scans audio files, collects information from
     file tags and prints it in the structured XML format.
   - amarok_afttagger - a helper program which writes/removes custom tags
     to/from media files required for embedded "Amarok File Tracking".
   - amzdownloader - easily download your files from Amazon if you have their
     references in an encrypted .amz file.
