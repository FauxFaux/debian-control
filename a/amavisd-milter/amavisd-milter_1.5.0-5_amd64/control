Description: amavisd-new interface for milter-capable MTAs
 This package provides a milter for amavisd-new that works with

 Replacing the older amavisd-new-milter program, amavisd-milter makes
 use of the full functionality of amavisd-new. It supports using spam

 adding address extensions, and selectively removing recipients.
