Description: Partition editor for Amiga partitions (cross version)
 Amiga-fdisk is, similar to fdisk for PCs, a program to partition
 harddisks. Though it seems to work quite well, it's still got some
 sort of beta status. It's suggested that you still use the AmigaDOS
 native tool "HDToolBox" to partition your harddisks and use
 amiga-fdisk only for querying partition information.
 This is the version for non-Amiga systems.
