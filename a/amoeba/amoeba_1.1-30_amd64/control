Description: fast-paced, polished OpenGL demonstration by Excess
 Amoeba is a fast-paced, cross-platform OpenGL demonstration by Excess,
 showing realtime graphics effects in perfect sync with music. It
 features a full customizable demo engine, several visual effects, lots
 of graphics and a pumping soundtrack.
 .
 Amoeba won first prize in the demo competition at Underscore 02, a
 demoscene party held in Gothenburg, Sweden.
 .
 Note that this is only the demo engine -- to watch the demo itself, you
 will also need the package amoeba-data.
