Description: use a bluetooth device as X remote control (systray applet)
 Amora (A mobile remote assistant) is an application that enables you
 to control your desktop using your mobile phone. It uses bluetooth to
 send mouse and keyboard events to the X session. With it, you can
 control your presentations, movies or any other application which
 mainly uses mouse and cursor keys.
 .
 Amora also has a screenshot feature, where you can see a thumbnail of
 the currently focused window on the mobile phone.
 .
 Currently only Symbian Series 60 mobile phones are supported. A Java
 client implementation is under development. A proof of concept client
 for Linux based mobile device like the Nokia Internet Tablets and the
 OpenMoko FreeRunner is available.
 .
 This package contains the Qt-based system tray applet version of the
 daemon running on the to be remote controlled computer. The client
 has to be installed on the mobile phone and is not contained in the
 package. It can be downloaded from the home page of the project.
