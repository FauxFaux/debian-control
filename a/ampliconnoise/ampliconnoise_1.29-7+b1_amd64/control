Description: removal of noise from 454 sequenced PCR amplicons
 AmpliconNoise is a package of applications to clean up high-throughput
 sequence data.  It consists of three main parts:
 .
 Pyronoise - does flowgram-based clustering to spot misreads
 SeqNoise - removes PCR point mutations
 Perseus - removes PCR chimeras without the need for a set of reference
 sequences
 .
 Previously there was a standalone "Pyronoise" by the same authors and
 this package includes an updated version.  There is also a "Denoiser"
 in Qiime which is related but distinct.
