Description: client for the eD2k and Kad networks, like eMule
 aMule is a peer-to-peer file sharing application, designed to connect
 to the eDonkey and Kad networks. It has a wide range of features,
 including many of the original eMule client, like:
 .
  * online signature, source exchange, compressed transfers, secure
    identification, and IP filter support
  * boolean search, which can be local, global, or in the Kad network
  * checks against aggressive clients
  * slot allocation, to decide the number of remote clients
  * systray works well both in GNOME and KDE
  * translations to many languages
 .
 A daemonized version of the application that does not need a graphic
 environment to run is available in the amule-daemon package, and
 various utilities of interest can be found in the amule-utils and
 amule-utils-gui packages, including the ed2k link handler.
