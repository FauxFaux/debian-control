Description: Daemon to transfer Android DNS property to resolv.conf
 Small user space daemon to get the Android DNS server setting and
 maintain the resolver config on a regulary basis. Note, that this
 daemon has to be started by some running android programs, in order
 to have the ANDROID_PROPERTY_WORKSPACE environment variable and
 the /dev/ashmem file descriptor (usually #9) that is inherited from
 the calling process. Another note: cannot be started from a login
 shell, because `bash --login` closes all inherited file descriptors.
 .
 This only makes sense to install on a Debian chroot running on Android.
