Description: Displays information about Android DEX files
 The `dexdump` tool is intended to mimic `objdump`. When possible, use similar
 command-line arguments.
 .
 This is a re-implementation of the original `dexdump` utility that was
 based on Dalvik functions in `libdex` into a new `dexdump` that is now
 based on ART functions in `libart` instead. The output is very similar to
 to the original for correct DEX files. Error messages may differ, however.
 Also, ODEX files are no longer supported.
