Description: Lists all methods in all concrete classes in Android DEX files
 This is a re-implementation of the original `dexlist` utility that was
 based on Dalvik functions in `libdex` into a new `dexlist` that is now
 based on ART functions in `libart` instead. The output is very similar to
 to the original for correct DEX files. Error messages may differ, however.
 Also, ODEX files are no longer supported.
