Description: Manipulate Dalvik eXchange format and produce dex files
 Dalvik is a process virtual machine in Google's Android operating system that
 executes applications written for Android.
 .
 dalvik-exchange is the home of Dalvik eXchange, the thing that takes in class
 files and reformulates them for consumption in the VM. It also does a few other
 things; use "dalvik-exchange --help" to see a modicum of self-documentation.
 .
 This program is officially named "dx" but in order to avoid naming conflict
 with OpenDX in Debian it is renamed to "dalvik-exchange".
 .
 This package also provides the "mainDexClasses" program.
