Description: Custom Javadoc doclet by Google
 Key differences between Doclava and the standard doclet include:
   * Refreshed look and feel, including search capabilities
   * Embeds versioning information in the documentation
   * Uses a templating engine for user customizations
   * Throw build errors for things that can easily be caught, like @param tags
     that don't match the parameter names.
   * Ability to include snippets of code from real source code
   * Federate documentation between multiple sites
   * Ability to embed javadocs in a larger web page.
 .
 This package is a fork of Doclava by The Android Open Source Project with
 special features for generating the source files of the Android platform
 framework API stubs "android.jar".
