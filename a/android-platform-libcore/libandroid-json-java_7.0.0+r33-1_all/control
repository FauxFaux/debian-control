Description: Android rewrite of the evil licensed json.org
 Json.org is a popular java library to parse and create JSON string from
 the author of the JSON standard Douglas Crockford. His implementation however
 is not free software[1].
 .
 Therefore the Android team did a cleanroom reimplementation of a JSON library
 to be used in place of the original one.
