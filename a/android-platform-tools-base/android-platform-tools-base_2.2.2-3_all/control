Description: base tools for developing applications for the Android system
 This package includes various tools for developing and building Android
 applications, e.g.
 .
  * Draw 9-patch: Allows you to easily create a NinePatch graphic using a
    WYSIWYG editor. It also previews stretched versions of the image, and
    highlights the area in which content is allowed.
 .

 default-jre or other non-headless JRE needs to be installed in order to run
 "draw9patch". However draw9patch fails to run due to bug #798794.
