Description: Android Plugin for Gradle - Documentations
 The Android build system uses the Android Plugin for Gradle to support building
 Android applications with the Gradle build toolkit. The plugin runs independent
 of Android Studio so the plugin and the Gradle build system can be updated
 independently of Android Studio. You can build your Android applications from
 within Android Studio or from the command line on your machine or on machines
 where Android Studio is not installed (such as continuous integration servers).
 .
 This package provides some templates for using the Gradle plugin.
