Description: Control an Android device using Python
 The monkeyrunner tool provides an API for writing programs that control an
 Android device or emulator from outside of Android code. With monkeyrunner,
 you can write a Python program that installs an Android application or test
 package, runs it, sends keystrokes to it, takes screenshots of its user
 interface, and stores screenshots on the workstation. The monkeyrunner tool is
 primarily designed to test applications and devices at the functional/framework
 level and for running unit test suites, but you are free to use it for other
 purposes.
