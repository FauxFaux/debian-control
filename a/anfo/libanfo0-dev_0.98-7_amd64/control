Description: Development files for Short Read Aligner/Mapper from MPG
 Anfo is a mapper in the spirit of Soap/Maq/Bowtie, but its implementation takes
 more after BLAST/BLAT. It's most useful for the alignment of sequencing reads
 where the DNA sequence is somehow modified (think ancient DNA or bisulphite
 treatment) and/or there is more divergence between sample and reference than
 what fast mappers will handle gracefully (say the reference genome is missing
 and a related species is used instead).
 .
 This package contains the development files that might be used in connection
 with the anfo binaries.
