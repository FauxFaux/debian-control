Description: Game data for angband
 Angband is a single-player, text-based, dungeon simulation derived
 from the game Moria, which was in turn based on Rogue. It is
 often described as a "roguelike" game because the look and feel of
 the game is still quite similar to Rogue (though there are now graphical
 tiles available if you dislike ASCII gaming). Angband has been in more or
 less continuous development since the early 1990s.
