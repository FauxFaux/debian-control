Description: Angular Maven Plugin
 The Angular Maven Plugin is a plugin designed to help developers who
 are deploying Angular.JS applications, but use maven as a build tool.
 So far there are two goals:
 .
 The html2js goal mimics grunt-html2js in combining html templates into
 a single javascript file for use with Angular.JS; it does NOT use grunt
 or nodejs.
 .
 The join goal ia a more complex goal designed to simplify assembly of a
 large modular Angular.JS application where modules are lazily loaded.
 The goal only deals with the reorganisation of the code, not the lazy
 loading itself.
