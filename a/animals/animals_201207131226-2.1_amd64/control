Description: Traditional AI animal guessing engine using a binary tree DB
 You think of an animal, and this package tries to guess it... when it's wrong,
 you teach it about your animal.
 .
 To be more flexible and help educational aspect this game does not contain
 an initial database. This also allows it to be used for non animals like
 guessing of tools or locations.
