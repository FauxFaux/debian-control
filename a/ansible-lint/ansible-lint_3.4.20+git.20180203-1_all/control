Description: lint tool for Ansible playbooks
 Ansible playbooks express configuration, deployment and orchestration in YAML
 format. They can describe a policy you want your remote systems to enforce,
  or a set of steps in a general IT process.
 .
 ansible-lint checks Ansible playbooks for practices and behaviour that could
 potentially be improved.
