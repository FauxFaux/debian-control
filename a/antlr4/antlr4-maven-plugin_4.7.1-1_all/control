Description: Maven plugin for ANTLR 4
 ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a powerful parser generator
 for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary
 files. It's widely used to build languages, tools, and frameworks. From a
 grammar, ANTLR generates a parser that can build and walk parse trees.
 .
 This package provides the Maven plugin that supports compiling ANTLR 4
 grammars during a Maven build.
