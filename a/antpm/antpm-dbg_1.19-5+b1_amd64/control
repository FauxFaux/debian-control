Description: ANT+ information retrieval client for Garmin GPS products
 This software uses the Garmin ANT+ proprietary USB keys and
 communication protocol to retrieve information (such as GPS traces)
 from some Garmin Forerunner watches such as Forerunner 405 and 310XT.
 .
 The underlying ANT+minus implements the ANT/ANT+/ANT-FS protocols to
 provide these tools: garmin-ant-downloader, antpm-downloader,
 antpm-fit2gpx, and antpm-usbmon2ant.
 .
 ANT+minus is a userspace implementation of a wire protocol similar
 to the ANT/ANT+/ANT-FS protocols. The goal is to be able to communicate
 with any ANT capable device in order to e.g. retrieve sports tracks. The
 c++ implementation is currently available under both linux and win.
 Communication with watches other than the 310XT might work, but are
 untested. Please report your experience to help improving the software.
 .
 The software was originally named "gant" but renamed when packaged
 to avoid confusion with existing Java software.
