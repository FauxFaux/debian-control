Description: lightweight, unobtrusive, Dvorak-optimized text editor
 A very small and efficient display editor built upon a philosophy of making
 interaction with UNIX text manipulation commands easy, rather than duplicating
 their features. Its command set is optimized for the Dvorak and QWERTY
 keyboard layouts.
 .
 Also includes asdfg, aoeui's QWERTY variant.
