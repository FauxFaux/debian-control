Description: Find RFI in radio astronomical observations (shared lib)
 The AOFlagger is a tool that can find and remove radio-frequency interference
 (RFI) in radio astronomical observations. The code has been highly optimized
 for speed and accuracy. It is used by default for the LOFAR radio telescope
 and thus is in productional stage. The software can run in a fully automated
 way, but a graphical interface is provided to analyse results and tweak the
 strategy. The preferred input file format is the Casa Measurement Set (MS)
 format.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
