Description: AOL web server version 4 - core libraries
 AOLserver is the web engine that powers America Online. It
 is capable of serving a very high number of users, and can host
 hundreds of virtual servers simultaneously within the same process.
 .
 It is similar in many respects to Zope, except based largely on Tcl.
 It is multi-threaded, and has a C API that can be used to extend
 its functionality.
 .
 This package provides the basic shared libraries which are needed by
 the daemon and are also useful for building add-on modules. It does
 not contain the AOLserver daemon, which is in aolserver4.
