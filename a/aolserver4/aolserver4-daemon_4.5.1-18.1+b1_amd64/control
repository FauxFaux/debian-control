Description: AOL web server version 4 - program files
 AOLserver is the web engine that powers America Online. It
 is capable of serving a very high number of users, and can host
 hundreds of virtual servers simultaneously within the same process.
 .
 It is similar in many respects to Zope, except based largely on Tcl.
 It is multi-threaded, and has a C API that can be used to extend
 its functionality.
 .
 This package provides the server itself.
