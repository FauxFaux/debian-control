Description: AOL web server version 4 - documentation
 AOLserver is the web engine that powers America Online. It
 is capable of serving a very high number of users, and can host
 hundreds of virtual servers simultaneously within the same process.
 .
 It is similar in many respects to Zope, except based largely on Tcl.
 It is multi-threaded, and has a C API that can be used to extend
 its functionality.
 .
 This package contains three reference manuals for AOLserver version 3+:
  - The AOLserver Administrator's Guide covers the setup options
    and security issues relating to running the server;
  - The AOLserver Tcl Developer's Guide covers the Tcl API which
    can be used to add features to your web pages (similar in
    some respects to PHP or Microsoft's ASP);
  - The AOLserver C Developer's Guide covers the C API which can
    be used to create new modules to extend AOLserver.
 .
 This is the latest available version of the documentation, but it is
 quite outdated and incomplete. More up-to-date API documentation is
 available at http://panoptic.com/wiki/aolserver/Tcl_API.
