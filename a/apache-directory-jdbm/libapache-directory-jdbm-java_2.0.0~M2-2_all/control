Description: ApacheDS JDBM Implementation
 JDBM is a transactional persistence engine for Java. It aims to be
 for Java what GDBM is for other languages (C/C++, Python, Perl, etc.):
 a fast, simple persistence engine. You can use it to store a mix
 of objects and BLOBs, and all updates are done in a transactionally
 safe manner. JDBM also provides scalable data structures, such as HTree
 and B+Tree, to support persistence of large object collections.
 .
 This package contains the Apache fork of JDBM used by Apache Directory Server.
