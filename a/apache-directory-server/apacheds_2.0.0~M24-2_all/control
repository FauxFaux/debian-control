Description: Apache Directory Server
 ApacheDS is an embbedable directory server entirely written in Java, which
 has been certified LDAPv3 compatible by the Open Group. Besides LDAP it
 supports Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol. It has been designed
 to introduce triggers, stored procedures, queues and views to the world
 of LDAP which has lacked these rich constructs.
