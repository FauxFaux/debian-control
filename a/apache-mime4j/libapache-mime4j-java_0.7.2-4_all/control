Description: MIME and RFC822 parser for Java
 mime4j provides a parser, MimeStreamParser, for e-mail message streams in
 plain rfc822 and MIME format. The parser uses a callback mechanism to report
 parsing events such as the start of an entity header, the start of a body,
 etc.
 If you are familiar with the SAX XML parser interface you should have no
 problem getting started with mime4j.
