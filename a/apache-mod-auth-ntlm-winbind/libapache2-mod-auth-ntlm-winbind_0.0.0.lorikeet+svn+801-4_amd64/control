Description: apache2 module for NTLM authentication against Winbind
 The mod_auth_ntlm_winbind module provides authentication and
 authorisation over the web against a Microsoft Windows NT/2000/XP/etc or
 Samba Domain Controller using Samba's winbind daemon running on the
 same machine Apache is running on.
 .
 If you're considering using this module, you should be aware that NTLM
 isn't regarded as very secure by modern standards - even Microsoft no longer
 recommends its use - and where possible, you probably want to use Kerberos with
 negotiate auth over https instead (see Debian package
 libapache2-mod-auth-kerb).
