Description: Compute APDEX from Apache-style logs
 APacheDEX parses Apache-style logs and generates several statistics
 intended for a website developer audience:
 .
   * APDEX (Application Performance inDEX, see http://www.apdex.org) ratio
     (plotted) because you want to know how satisfied your users are.
 .
   * hit count (plotted) because achieving 100% APDEX is easy when there
     is nobody around.
 .
   * HTTP status codes, with optional detailed output of the most frequent
     URLs per error status code, along with their most frequent referers
     because your forgot to update a link to that conditionally-used
     browser compatibility javascript you renamed.
 .
   * Hottest pages (pages which use rendering time the most) because you
     want to know where to invest time to get highest user experience
     improvement.
 .
   * ERP5 sites: per-module statistics, with module and document views
     separated because module and document types are not born equal in
     usage patterns.
