Description: Arbitrary precision calculator (common files)
 Calc is an arbitrary precision arithmetic system that uses a C-like

 mathematical research tool. More importantly, calc provides one with a
 machine independent means of computation. Calc comes with a rich set of
 builtin mathematical and programmatic functions.
