Description: Library for arbitrary precision arithmetic
 This package contains the library libcalc.a and the necessary header files
 which provide routines to handle arbitrary precision arithmetic with
 integers, rational numbers, or complex numbers. There are also many numeric
 functions such as factorial and gcd, along with some transcendental
 functions such as sin and exp.
 .
 This library is also used by the commandline calculator `calc', which is
 provided in the Debian package `apcalc'.
