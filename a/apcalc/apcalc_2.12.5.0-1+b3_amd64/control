Description: Arbitrary precision calculator (original name: calc)
 Calc is an arbitrary precision arithmetic system that uses a C-like
 language. Calc is useful as a calculator, an algorithm prototyper and as a
 mathematical research tool. More importantly, calc provides one with a
 machine independent means of computation. Calc comes with a rich set of
 builtin mathematical and programmatic functions.
 .
 Calc is built on top of the library libcalc that represents numeric values
 as fractions reduced to their lowest terms. This library can also be used
 to add arbitrary precision capabilities to your own programs and is
 available in the Debian package `apcalc-dev'.
 .
 The original name of this package is `calc', but it had to be changed to
 `apcalc' for Debian, because there's already another package called `calc'
 in Debian. Nevertheless, the binary and manpage installed by this package
 are still named `calc'.
