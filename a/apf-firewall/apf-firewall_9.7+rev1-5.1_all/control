Description: easy iptables based firewall system
 Advanced Policy Firewall (APF) is an iptables(netfilter) based firewall
 system designed around the essential needs of today's Internet deployed
 servers and the unique needs of custom deployed Linux installations. The
 configuration of APF is designed to be very informative and present the
 user with an easy to follow process, from top to bottom of the
 configuration file. The management of APF on a day-to-day basis is
 conducted from the command line with the 'apf' command, which includes
 detailed usage information and all the features one would expect from a
 current and forward thinking firewall solution.
 .
 Summary of features:
   * detailed and well commented configuration file
   * granular inbound and outbound network filtering
   * user id based outbound network filtering
   * application based network filtering
   * trust based rule files with an optional advanced syntax
   * global trust system where rules can be downloaded from a central
     management server
   * reactive address blocking (RAB), next generation in-line intrusion
     prevention
   * debug mode provided for testing new features and configuration setups
   * fast load feature that allows for 1000+ rules to load in under 1 second
   * inbound and outbound network interfaces can be independently configured
   * global tcp/udp port & icmp type filtering with multiple methods of
     executing filters (drop, reject, prohibit)
   * configurable policies for each ip on the system with convenience variables
     to import settings
   * packet flow rate limiting that prevents abuse on the most widely abused
     protocol, icmp

   * dshield.org block list support to ban networks exhibiting suspicious
     activity
   * spamhaus Don't Route Or Peer List support to ban known "hijacked zombie"
