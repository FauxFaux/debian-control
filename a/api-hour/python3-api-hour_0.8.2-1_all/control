Description: lightweight daemon framework to write AsyncIO based applications
 API Hour was created to answer the need for a simple, robust, and super-fast
 server-side environment to build very efficient Daemons with ease.
 .
 By default, API-Hour Starter Kit (Cookiecutter) creates for you a HTTP daemon
 to develop WebServices.
 .
 With API-Hour, you can quickly convert any AsyncIO server library to
 multi-processing daemon, ready for production.
