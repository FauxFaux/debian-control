Description: automatic generator of basic unit tests for a C/C++ library API
 API Sanity Checker is an automatic generator of basic unit tests for a C/C++
 library. It helps to quickly generate simple ("sanity" or "shallow" quality)
 tests for every function in an API using their signatures, data type
 definitions and relationships between functions straight from the library
 header files ("Header-Driven Generation"). Each test case contains a function
 call with reasonable (in most, but unfortunately not all, cases) input
 parameters. The quality of generated tests allows one to check absence of
 critical errors in simple use cases and can be greatly improved by involving of
 highly reusable specialized types for the library.
 .
 The tool can execute generated tests and detect crashes, aborts, all kinds of
 emitted signals, non-zero program return code, program hang‚Äê ing and
 requirement failures (if specified). The tool can be considered as a tool for
 out-of-box low-cost sanity checking of library API or as a test development
 framework for initial generation of templates for advanced tests. Also it
 supports universal Template2Code format of tests, splint specifications, random
 test generation mode and other useful features.
