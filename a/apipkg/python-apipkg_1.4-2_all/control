Description: namespace control and lazy-import mechanism for Python
 With apipkg you can control the exported namespace of a Python package and
 greatly reduce the number of imports for your users. It is a small pure
 Python module that works on virtually all Python versions, including
 CPython2.3 to Python3.1, Jython and PyPy. It co-operates well with Python's
 help() system, custom importers (PEP302) and common command line completion
 tools.
 .
 This package contains apipkg for Python 2.
