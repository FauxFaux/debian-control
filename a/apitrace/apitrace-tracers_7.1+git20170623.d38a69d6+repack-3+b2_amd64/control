Description: tools for debugging OpenGL applications and drivers - application tracer
 apitrace is a suite of tools for debugging OpenGL applications and drivers.
 It includes a tool to generate a trace of all the OpenGL calls an application
 makes and a tool for replaying these traces and inspecting the rendering and
 OpenGL state during the program's execution.
 .
 This makes it useful for identifying the sources of graphical corruption in
 OpenGL applications.
 .
 This package contains the components required to trace the OpenGL calls made
 by an application and record them into a trace file for later replay and
 debugging.
