Description: XEmacs lisp for A+ development
 This package contains the XEmacs lisp required for the development of A+
 programs.  It does the key bindings, sets the font properly, and binds some
 function keys. The complete A+ development environment is provided by the
 aplus-fsf-dev package.
 .
 To load A+ from XEmacs, load a file with extension .apl, .a or .+, or
 use the command 'M-x a-mode'.  Or, press F4 to start the A+ interpreter.
 .
 See /usr/share/doc/README.Debian.gz if you have trouble entering the special
 A+ characters in XEmacs.
 .
 This package is now an empty dummy package because XEmacs is no longer
 available.  If that changes, this package will be resurrected.
