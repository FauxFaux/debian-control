Description: A+ programming language run-time environment
 A+ is a powerful and efficient programming language. It is freely
 available under the GNU General Public License. It embodies a rich set
 of functions and operators, a modern graphical user interface with
 many widgets and automatic synchronization of widgets and variables,
 asynchronous execution of functions associated with variables and
 events, dynamic loading of user compiled subroutines, and many other
 features. Execution is by a rather efficient interpreter. A+ was
 created at Morgan Stanley. Primarily used in a
 computationally-intensive business environment, many critical
 applications written in A+ have withstood the demands of real world
 developers over many years. Written in an interpreted language, A+
 applications tend to be portable.
 .
 This package contains the binaries and libraries needed to run A+ programs.
 The A+ development environment is provided by the aplus-fsf-dev package.
