Description: Utilities for Advanced Power Management (APM)
 On laptop computers, the Advanced Power Management (APM) support
 provides access to battery status information and may help you to
 conserve battery power, depending on your laptop and the APM
 implementation.  The apmd program also lets you run arbitrary programs
 when APM events happen (for example, you can eject PCMCIA devices when
 you suspend, or change hard drive timeouts when you connect the battery).
 .
 This package contains apmd(8), a daemon for logging and acting on APM
 events; and apm(1), a client that prints the information in /proc/apm
 in a readable format.
 .
 apmd is notified of APM events by the APM driver in the kernel.
 .
 Since lenny Debian kernels are not built with APM support anymore. You
 need to compile a kernel with apm support enabled to use this package.
 You need to boot the kernel with the "apm=on" option if you
 want to enable the driver.
 .
 In most cases, users may want to know that there are newer power
 management schemes, like ACPI.
