Description: console-based bookmark tool for fast file system navigation
 Fast file system navigation by bookmarking directories and jumping to a
 bookmark directly. Apparix integrates regular bookmarks with
 CDPATH-style bookmarks. Subdirectory specification and (bash) tab
 completion add further power.
 .
 Apparix maintains a mapping of user-defined marks (hopefully short and
 descriptive) to file system locations and is wrapped in other commands
 to either jump to those locations or to invoke edit/copy/move commands
 involving them.
