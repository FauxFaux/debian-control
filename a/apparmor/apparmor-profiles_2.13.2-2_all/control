Description: experimental profiles for AppArmor security policies
 apparmor-profiles provides various experimental AppArmor profiles.
 Do not expect these profiles to work out-of-the-box.
 .
 These profiles are not mature enough to be shipped in enforce mode by
 default on Debian. They are shipped in complain mode so that users
 can test them, choose which are desired, and help improve them
 upstream if needed.
 .
 Some even more experimental profiles are included in
 /usr/share/doc/apparmor-profiles/extras/.
