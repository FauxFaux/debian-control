Description: GNOME library to access AppStream services
 AppStream is a cross-distribution effort for creating and sharing
 metadata about software components available in the package repositories
 of a distribution.
 .
 This package contains a GObject-based library to read and write AppStream
 XML metadata and retrieve additional data such as screenshots.
 .
 As opposed to libappstream, this library does not use an on-disk cache but
 reads data directly from the XML or DEP-11 YAML files.
