Description: Software component metadata management
 AppStream is a metadata specification, allowing to write metadata for
 software projects in a standardized format.
 It provides facilities to easily access and transform the data, as well
 as a few additional services to allow building feature-rich software center
 applications.
 .
 This package provides tools to generate, maintain and query the AppStream
 data pool of installed and available software, and enables integration
 with the APT package manager.
 .
 The 'appstreamcli' tool can be used for accessing the software component
 pool as well as for working with AppStream metadata directly, including
 validating it for compliance with the specification.
