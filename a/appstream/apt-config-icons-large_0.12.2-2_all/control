Description: APT configuration snippet to enable large icon downloads
 This package contains an APT configuration snippet that enables the
 download of an icon tarball containing application icons for display in
 software centers.
 Icons get downloaded directly from the archive via regular cache updates,
 and match the software currently available in the respective archive suites.
 .
 This snippet enables icon tarball downloads in large, 128x128px size.
 If these bigger icons are not downloaded by APT, a software center may
 decide to fetch them on-demand from a web location.
