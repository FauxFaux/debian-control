Description: APT configuration snippet to enable icon downloads
 This package contains an APT configuration snippet that enables the
 download of an icon tarball containing application icons for display in
 software centers.
 Icons get downloaded directly from the archive via regular cache updates,
 and match the software currently available in the respective archive suites.
 .
 This snippet enables icons of the default icon size set in the AppStream
 specification for software centers, 64x64px. It also enables downloads
 of smaller 48x48px icons.
