Description: AprilTags Visual Fiducial System
 AprilTag is a visual fiducial system, useful for a wide variety of tasks
 including augmented reality, robotics, and camera calibration. Targets can be
 created from an ordinary printer, and the AprilTag detection software computes
 the precise 3D position, orientation, and identity of the tags relative to the
 camera. The AprilTag library is implemented in C with no external dependencies.
 It is designed to be easily included in other applications, as well as be
 portable to embedded devices. Real-time performance can be achieved even on
 cell-phone grade processors.
