Description: runtime libraries for APRON
 The APRON library is dedicated to the static analysis of the numerical
 variables of a program by Abstract Interpretation. The aim of such an analysis
 is to infer invariants about these variables. It is intended to be a common
 interface to various underlying libraries/abstract domains and to provide
 additional services that can be implemented independently from the underlying
 library/abstract domain.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed at runtime.
