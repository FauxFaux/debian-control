Description: utility for tracking non-official package versions
 apt-forktracer tries to alleviate the problem that APT stops tracking official
 versions of a package after you pin it or install a newer version.
 .
 apt-forktracer displays a list of packages which are in an inconsistent state,
 or whose installed version is different than the newest official one. You can
 choose to ignore certain packages - if they match certain criteria - using
 a configuration file.
