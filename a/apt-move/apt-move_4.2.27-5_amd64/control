Description: maintain Debian packages in a package pool
 apt-move is used to move a collection of Debian package files into a
 proper archive hierarchy as is used in the official Debian archive. It
 is intended as a tool to help manage the apt-get(8) file cache, but
 could be configured to work with any collection of Debian packages.
 .
 Running apt-move periodically will assist in managing the resulting
 partial mirror by optionally removing obsolete packages, and creating
 valid local Packages.gz files. It can also build a partial or complete
 local mirror of a Debian binary distribution (including an
 ``installed-packages only'' mirror).
