Description: recursively lists package dependencies
 This utility can recursively list package dependencies, either forwards
 or in reverse. It also lists forward build-dependencies. The output
 format closely resembles that of `apt-cache depends`. As well, it can
 generate .dot graphs, much like apt-cache in dotty mode.
