Description: manage Debian source packages
 apt-src is a command line interface for downloading, installing, upgrading,
 and tracking Debian source packages. It makes source package management
 feel a lot like using apt to manage binary packages, and is being used as
 a testbed to work on adding source dependencies to Debian.
 .
 It can be run as a normal user, or as root. If you want a convenient way to
 track updates to packages while preserving your local modifications, this is
 a way to do that.
