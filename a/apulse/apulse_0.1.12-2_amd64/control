Description: PulseAudio emulation for ALSA
 The program provides an alternative partial implementation of the PulseAudio
 API. It consists of a loader script and a number of shared libraries with the
 same names as from original PulseAudio, so applications could dynamically load
 them and think they are talking to PulseAudio. Internally, no separate sound
 mixing daemon is used. Instead, apulse relies on ALSA's dmix, dsnoop, and plug
 plugins to handle multiple sound sources and capture streams running at the
 same time. dmix plugin muxes multiple playback streams; dsnoop plugin allow
 multiple applications to capture from a single microphone; and plug plugin
 transparently converts audio between various sample formats, sample rates and
 channel numbers.
