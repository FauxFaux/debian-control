Description: 3D rendering solution adhering to the RenderMan(R) standard, examples
 Aqsis is a high quality, photorealistic, 3D rendering solution. It complies
 with the RenderMan(R) interface standard defined by Pixar.
 .
 The RenderMan(R) standard has been used in film and television visual effects
 since its introduction in 1989. Pixar has used their own implementation for all
 of their award winning CG features, and provided their implementation for use
 in the visual effects of most major blockbuster films over the last 2
 decades. The Aqsis project offers a way for individuals and organisations alike
 to gain experience with the RenderMan(R) interface without the cost of
 commercial software licenses.
 .
 This package contains examples like scenes, procedurals and shaders.
