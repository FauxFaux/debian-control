Description: Command line utility for searching the Debian package database
 ara is a utility for searching the Debian package database using
 boolean regexp queries.
 .
 ara can perform sophisticated searches on that database. It is possible
 to use any field of the package database as a search criterion and any
 boolean combination thereof.
 .
 ara can also call APT (or any user-configurable command) to install or
 remove packages matching a query.
