Description: tRNA and tmRNA detection in nucleotide sequences
 The program employs heuristic algorithms to predict tRNA secondary structure,
 based on homology with recognized tRNA consensus sequences and ability to form
 a base-paired cloverleaf. tmRNA genes are identified using a modified version
 of the BRUCE program.
