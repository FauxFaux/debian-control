Description: detect architectures supported by your machine/kernel
 This package lets you enumerate architectures that your kernel can run.
 The check is for the ability to run machine code and supporting appropriate
 syscall ABI -- you may need to install userland libraries in a chroot,
 container or via multiarch to actually execute non-static binaries of such
 architectures.
 .

  * amd64, i386, x32
