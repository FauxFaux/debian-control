Description: mounts an archive for access as a file system
 archivemount is a FUSE based file system for Unix variants, including Linux.
 Its purpose is to mount archives to a mount point where it can be read from
 or written to as with any other file system.
 This makes accessing the contents of the archive, which maybe compressed,
 transparent to other programs, without decompressing them.

  *   old-style tar archives,

  .
  *   the POSIX 'pax interchange' format,
  .
  *   GNU-format tar archives,
  .
  *   most common cpio archive formats,
  .
  *   ISO9660 CD images (with or without RockRidge extensions),
  .
  *   Zip archives.
  .
