Description: a simple email archiver written in perl
 Archmbox is a simple email archiver written in perl; it parses one or
 more mailboxes, selects some or all messages and then performs  specific
 actions on the selected messages.
 At this time archmbox supports mbox and mbx mailbox formats.
 .
 Messages selection is based upon a date criteria; an absolute date
 or a days offset can be specified. It is also possible to refine the
 selection using regular expressions on the header fields of the message.
 All archived messages are stored in a new mailbox with the same name
 of the original one plus .archived as extension (this is the default, but
 can be changed); the archive mailbox can be saved in gz or bz2
 compressed format as well.
