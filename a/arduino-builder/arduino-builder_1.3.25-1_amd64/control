Description: Command line tool for compiling Arduino sketches
 This tool is able to parse Arduino Hardware specifications, properly run 'gcc'
 and produce compiled sketches.
 .
 An Arduino sketch differs from a standard C program in that it misses a 'main'
 (provided by the Arduino core), function prototypes are not mandatory, and
 libraries inclusion is automagic (you just have to  #include  them). This tool
 generates function prototypes and gathers library paths, providing 'gcc' with
 all the needed '-I' params.
