Description: streamlined C++ linear algebra library
 Armadillo is a streamlined C++ linear algebra library (matrix maths)
 aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. Integer,
 floating point and complex numbers are supported, as well as a subset
 of trigonometric and statistics functions. Optional integration with
 LAPACK and ATLAS libraries is also provided.
