Description: dedicated game server for Armagetron Advanced
 Armagetron Advanced is a 3D game based on the light cycle racing in the movie
 "Tron". You have to control a light cycle that can only turn in steps of 90
 degrees, leaves a solid wall behind and can not be stopped.  The aim is to
 survive the longest of all players by not crashing into any walls.
 .
 This version of Armagetron Advanced can only be used as a network game server.
 It does not have graphical output and can be controlled via the text console.
 .
 The normal Armagetron Advanced used for playing is also capable to serve
 games, but will require X to display its graphics, will provide a player and
 is therefore unsuited for permanent game servers.
