Description: 3D Tron-like high speed game
 The rules are simple: you ride a light cycle (a kind of motorbike that can
 only turn 90 degrees at a time, leaves a wall behind and cannot be stopped)
 and have to avoid running into walls while at the same time you have to try to
 get your opponent to run into them.
 .
 The idea is based on the Disney movie from 1982 called "Tron".  If you ever
 wanted to take a try at one of those speed demons features in the movie, this
 is your chance.
 .
 Armagetron Advanced can be played against AI opponents, against other humans
 over the network, or a mixture of both.
