Description: ARMCI-MPI (Development version)
 ARMCI-MPI is a completely rewritten implementation of the ARMCI one-sided
 communication interface that uses MPI RMA for one-sided communication.
 .
 The purpose of the Aggregate Remote Memory Copy (ARMCI) library is to provide
 a general-purpose, efficient, and widely portable remote memory access (RMA)
 operations (one-sided communication) optimized for contiguous and
 noncontiguous (strided, scatter/gather, I/O vector) data transfers.
 .
 This version contains the Fortran90 modules and the static library.
