Description: single- and multi-homed firewall script with DSL/ADSL support
 Unlike other lean iptables frontends in Debian, arno-iptables-firewall
 will setup and load a secure, restrictive firewall by just asking a few
 question. This includes configuring internal networks for internet access
 via NAT and potential network services (e.g. http or ssh).
 .
 However, it is in no way restricted to this simple setup. Some catch words
 of additional features, that can be enabled in the well documented
 configuration file are: DSL/ADSL, Port forwarding, DMZ's,
 portscan detection, MAC address filtering.
