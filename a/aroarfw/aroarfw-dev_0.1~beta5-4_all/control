Description: framework to build hardware with RoarAudio protocol support
 This is a framework used to build hardware with support for the RoarAudio
 protocol.
 .
 This package contains C header files with most important
 magic numbers, data types and macros to work on RoarAudio messages.
 .
 This is not a complete library to access a server. If you search
 for a library which handles all the stuff for you on
 UNIX and UNIX like Operating Systems like Debian you better
 have a look at libroar and libmuroar.
