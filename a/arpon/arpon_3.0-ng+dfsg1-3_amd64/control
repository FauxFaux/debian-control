Description: Versatile ARP defense daemon
 ArpON can defend a host against some ARP attacks such as ARP spoofing, ARP
 cache poisoning and ARP poison routing.  Attackers can use these techniques to
 redirect traffic in local networks and execute Man in the Middle (MITM)
 attacks.
 .
 ArpON runs as a daemon in user space.  When enabled on an interface, it
 disables some aspects of Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) handling by the
 Linux kernel and instead handles ARP messages itself and maintains the ARP
 neighbor cache.  It has three modes of operation to support different ways of
 assigning IPv4 addresses in the local network: statically, dynamically using
 DHCP or a combination of both.
