Description: Ethernet/FDDI station activity monitor
 Arpwatch maintains a database of Ethernet MAC addresses seen on the
 network, with their associated IP pairs.  Alerts the system administrator
 via e-mail if any change happens, such as new station/activity,
 flip-flops, changed and re-used old addresses.
 .
 If you want to maintain a list authorized MAC addresses manually, take a look
 at the arpalert package which may fit your needs better.
