Description: Common development files for ArrayFire
 ArrayFire is a high performance software library for parallel computing
 with an easy-to-use API. Its array based function set makes parallel
 programming simple.
 .
 ArrayFire's multiple backends (CUDA, OpenCL and native CPU) make it
 platform independent and highly portable.
 .
 A few lines of code in ArrayFire can replace dozens of lines of parallel
 computing code, saving you valuable time and lowering development costs.
 .
 This package provides the development files common to all backends of the
 ArrayFire library.
