Description: Simplifies management of several Debian packages
 Arriero is a tool that allows simplifying the management of Debian packages,
 particularly useful when having to make new upstream releases, builds and
 uploads of similar packages.
 .
 It relies heavily in the use of git-buildpackage, and general git practices,
 so it's only useful for packages currently maintained through git.
