Description: simulation tools to generate synthetic next-generation sequencing reads
 ART is a set of simulation tools to generate synthetic next-generation
 sequencing reads. ART simulates sequencing reads by mimicking real
 sequencing process with empirical error models or quality profiles
 summarized from large recalibrated sequencing data. ART can also
 simulate reads using user own read error model or quality profiles. ART
 supports simulation of single-end, paired-end/mate-pair reads of three
 major commercial next-generation sequencing platforms: Illumina's
 Solexa, Roche's 454 and Applied Biosystems' SOLiD. ART can be used to
 test or benchmark a variety of method or tools for next-generation
 sequencing data analysis, including read alignment, de novo assembly,
 SNP and structure variation discovery. ART was used as a primary tool
 for the simulation study of the 1000 Genomes Project . ART is
 implemented in C++ with optimized algorithms and is highly efficient in
 read simulation. ART outputs reads in the FASTQ format, and alignments
 in the ALN format. ART can also generate alignments in the SAM
 alignment or UCSC BED file format. ART can be used together with genome
 variants simulators (e.g. VarSim) for evaluating variant calling tools
 or methods.
