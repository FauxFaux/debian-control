Description: ou7puts artificial FASTQ files derived from a reference genome (examples)
 ArtificialFastqGenerator takes the reference genome (in FASTA format) as
 input and outputs artificial FASTQ files in the Sanger format. It can
 accept Phred base quality scores from existing FASTQ files, and use them
 to simulate sequencing errors. Since the artificial FASTQs are derived
 from the reference genome, the reference genome provides a gold-standard
 for calling variants (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and
 insertions and deletions (indels)). This enables evaluation of a Next
 Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis pipeline which aligns reads to the
 reference genome and then calls the variants.
 .
 This package contains example data for artfastqgenerator.
