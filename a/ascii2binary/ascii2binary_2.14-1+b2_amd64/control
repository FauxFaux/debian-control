Description: Convert between ASCII, hexadecimal and binary representations
 This package contains:
  * ascii2binary reads input consisting of ascii or hexadecimal representation
    numbers separated by whitespace and produces as output the binary
    equivalents. The type and precision of the binary output is selected
    using command line flags.
  * binary2ascii reads input consisting of binary numbers and converts
    them to their ascii or hexadecimal representation.
    Command line flags specify the type and size of the binary numbers
    and provide control over the format of the output.
    Unsigned integers may be written out in binary, octal, decimal,
    or hexadecimal.
    Signed integers may be written out only in binary or decimal. Floating
    point numbers may be written out only decimal, either in standard or
    scientific notation. (If you want to examine the binary representation
    of floating point numbers, just treat the input as a sequence of unsigned
    characters.)
 .
 The two programs are useful for generating test data, for inspecting binary
 files, and for interfacing programs that generate textual output to programs
 that require  binary input and conversely. They can also be useful when it is
 desired to reformat numbers.
