Description: clock designed with the NeXTStep look
 This little application displays the time of the day (digital, either
 12 or 24 hour format), and the date. It provides three alternatives:
 one suitable for low color systems, one with "real" NeXTStep colors,
 and the third one is somewhat in between.
