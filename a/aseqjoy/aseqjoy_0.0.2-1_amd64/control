Description: Joystick to ALSA MIDI Sequencer Converter
 In fact itâ€™s a really tiny piece of software that turns a joystick into a MIDI
 controller for the ALSA sequencer infrastructure.
 .
 Its original purpose was to test the MIDI interface of terminatorX but that
 turned out to be fun, so it made it here in the hope that it could be useful
 for other experiments.
 .
 For a more detailed description on what it does and how to use it have a
 look the manpage.
