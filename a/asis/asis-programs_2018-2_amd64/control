Description: Ada Semantic Interface Specification (ASIS) example programs
 ASIS (Ada Semantic Interface Specification) lets you develop applications
 to walk through the sources of your Ada programs and examine the semantic
 constructs.
 .
  * asistant is an interactive command-line tool to explore the ASIS parse tree
    of a program.
  * gnatcheck verifies the conformance of source text to coding conventions
  * gnatelim finds out unused subprograms and eliminates them.
  * gnatmetric calculates metrics such as code complexity.
  * gnatpp is a pretty-printer which reformats Ada source text according to
    a default or user-specified style guide.
  * gnatstub generates an empty but compilable body for a given specification.
  * gnattest creates AUnit test skeletons and harness for a project
    (gnattest requires the libaunit development package to be installed)
