Description: Adaptive Sampling Kit for big experimental spaces
 Adaptive Sampling Kit (ASK) is a toolkit for sampling big experimental spaces.
 When the space is small, the response can be measured for every point in the
 space. When the space is large, doing an exhaustive measurement is either not
 possible in terms of execution time or simply not practical. ASK tries to find
 good approximations of the response by sampling only a small fraction of the
 space. ASK features multiple active learning algorithms to prioritize the
 exploration of the interesting parts of the experimental space.
