Description: development files for ASL
 The Advanced Simulation Library (ASL) is a free and open source hardware
 accelerated multiphysics simulation platform (and an extensible general
 purpose tool for solving Partial Differential Equations).
 .
 Its computational engine is written in OpenCL and utilizes matrix-free
 solution techniques which enable extraordinarily high performance,
 memory efficiency and deployability on a variety of massively parallel
 architectures, ranging from inexpensive FPGAs, DSPs and GPUs up to
 heterogeneous clusters and supercomputers. The engine is hidden entirely
 behind simple C++ classes, so that no OpenCL knowledge is required from
 application programmers. Mesh-free, immersed boundary approach allows one
 to move from CAD directly to simulation drastically reducing pre-processing
 efforts and amount of potential errors.
 .
 ASL can be used to model various coupled physical and chemical phenomena and
 employed in a multitude of fields: computational fluid dynamics, virtual
 sensing, industrial process data validation and reconciliation, image-guided
 surgery, computer-aided engineering, design space exploration,
 crystallography, etc...
 .
 This package contains the development files.
