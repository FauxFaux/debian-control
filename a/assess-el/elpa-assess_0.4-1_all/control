Description: test support functions for Emacs
 This package provides functions to support ert, the Emacs Regression
 Test framework. It includes:
 .
  * a set of predicates for comparing strings, buffers and file contents;
  * explainer functions for all predicates giving useful output;
  * macros for creating many temporary buffers at once, and for restoring
    the buffer list;
  * methods for testing indentation, by comparison or "round-tripping";
  * methods for testing fontification;
 .
 Assess aims to be a stateless as possible, leaving Emacs unchanged
 whether the tests succeed or fail, with respect to buffers, open
 files and so on; this helps to keep tests independent from each
 other. Violations of this will be considered a bug.
 .
 Assess aims also to be as noiseless as possible, reducing and
 suppressing extraneous messages where possible, to leave a clean ert
 output in batch mode.
