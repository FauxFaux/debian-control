Description: 3D model import library (utilities)
 Assimp is a library to import various well-known 3D model formats ("assets") in
 a uniform manner.
 Assimp aims at providing a full asset conversion pipeline for use in game
 engines / realtime rendering systems of any kind but is not limited to this
 audience.
 .
 This package contains additional commandline utilities (currently only
 'assimp') to interact with 3D models.
