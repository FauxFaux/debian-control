Description: asterisk PBX sound files - Italian
 Asterisk is an Open Source PBX and telephony toolkit. It is, in a
 sense, middleware between Internet and telephony channels on the
 bottom, and Internet and telephony applications at the top.
 .
 Asterisk includes a set of standard sound files in various formats.
 The core part of that collection in Italian, by voice actor Carlo
 Flora, is contained in various encodings in packages
 asterisk-core-sounds-it-*; this package registers these through the
 alternatives system to provide the default "it" and "it_IT" (Italian)
 sounds.
