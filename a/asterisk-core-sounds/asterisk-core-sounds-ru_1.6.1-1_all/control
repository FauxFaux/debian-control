Description: asterisk PBX sound files - Russian
 Asterisk is an Open Source PBX and telephony toolkit. It is, in a
 sense, middleware between Internet and telephony channels on the
 bottom, and Internet and telephony applications at the top.
 .
 Asterisk includes a set of standard sound files in various formats.
 The core part of that collection in Russian, by Maxim Topal, is
 contained in various encodings in packages asterisk-core-sounds-ru-*;
 this package registers these through the alternatives system to
 provide the default "ru" and "ru_RU" (Russian) sounds.
