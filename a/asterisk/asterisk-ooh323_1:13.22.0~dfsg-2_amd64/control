Description: H.323 protocol support for the Asterisk PBX - ooH323c
 Asterisk is an Open Source PBX and telephony toolkit.
 .
 This channel driver (chan_ooh323c) provides support for the H.323 protocol
 for Asterisk. This is an independent implementation that does not depend
 on OpenH323, but may be less functional than the original chan_h323.
 .
 For more information about the Asterisk PBX, have a look at the Asterisk
 package.
