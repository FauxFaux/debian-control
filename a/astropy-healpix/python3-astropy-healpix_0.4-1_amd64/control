Description: HEALPix representation of spherical data - Python 3
 HEALPix is an acronym for Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization
 of a sphere. As suggested in the name, this pixelization produces a
 subdivision of a spherical surface in which each pixel covers the same
 surface area as every other pixel. It is commonly used to store all-sky
 astronomical images, most famously maps of the cosmic microwave background.
 .
 This is a BSD-licensed HEALPix package developed by the Astropy project
 and based on C code written by Dustin Lang in astrometry.net.
 .
 This package provides modules for Python 3.
