Description: modular IRC services daemon - contrib modules
 atheme-services is a portable, secure set of open source, modular IRC
 services, designed to run on many IRC server implementations.
 .
 Unlike alternative packages, atheme-services' core is minimalistic,
 providing only core functionality. atheme-services is a complete services
 set, excluding features designed for oper abuse.
 .
 This package contains the contrib modules, which may be either silly or
 undesired in a standard install.
