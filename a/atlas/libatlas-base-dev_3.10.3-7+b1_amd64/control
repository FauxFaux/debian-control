Description: Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software, generic static
 ATLAS is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of
 numerical software. Currently ATLAS supplies optimized versions for the
 complete set of linear algebra kernels known as the Basic Linear Algebra
 Subroutines (BLAS), and a subset of the linear algebra routines in the
 LAPACK library.
 .
 This package includes the headers, the static libraries and symbolic links
 needed for program development.
