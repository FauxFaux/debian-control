Description: Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software, test programs
 ATLAS is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of
 numerical software. Currently ATLAS supplies optimized versions for the
 complete set of linear algebra kernels known as the Basic Linear Algebra
 Subroutines (BLAS), and a subset of the linear algebra routines in the
 LAPACK library.
 .
 This package provides dynamically linked testing and bench-marking
 binaries to compare the BLAS and ATLAS libraries on your system.
