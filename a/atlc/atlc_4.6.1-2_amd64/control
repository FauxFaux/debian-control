Description: Arbitrary Transmission Line Calculator
 atlc is a computer aided design (CAD) package for the design and analysis
 of electrical transmission lines and directional couplers of totally
 arbitrary cross section and an arbitrary number of different dielectrics.
 .
 By analysis, it is assumed one requires finding the electrical properties
 of a transmission line or coupler, where the physical dimensions of the
 device are known.  By design, it is assumed one requires a transmission
 line or coupler to have certain electrical properties and one wishes to
 find how to physically realise such a structure
 .
 atlc likely to be of use to radio amateurs, professional RF engineers,
 students and academics.
