Description: Original two-player color puzzle game
 Atom-4 is a two-player color manipulation game played with colored
 spherical pieces on a board divided into equilateral triangles. The
 player who first makes a row of 4 pieces of the right color wins.
 However, the players do not directly play pieces of the winning color;
 they must construct their winning pieces via color changes that happen
 to neighbouring pieces whenever a new piece is placed on the board.
 .
 Atom-4 supports both a curses-based text interface and an X11 interface.
