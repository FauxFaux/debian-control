Description: tool for managing file archives of various types
 atool is a script for managing file archives of various types (tar,
 tar+gzip, zip etc). The main command is probably aunpack,
 extracting files from an archive. It overcomes the dreaded "multiple
 files in archive root" problem by first extracting to a unique
 subdirectory, and then moving back the files if possible. aunpack
 also prevents local files from being overwritten by mistake.
 .
 Other commands provided are apack (create archives), als (list files
 in archives), and acat (extract files to standard out).
