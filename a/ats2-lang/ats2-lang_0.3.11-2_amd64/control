Description: ATS version 2 programming language compiler
 ATS2 a.k.a. ATS/Postiats is a programming language with a highly expressive
 type system rooted in the framework Applied Type System. In particular, both
 dependent types and linear types are available in ATS. The current
 implementation of ATS (ATS/Postiats) is written in ATS (ATS/Anairiats) itself.
 It can be as efficient as C/C++ and supports a variety of programming
 paradigms.
 .
 In addition, ATS contains a component ATS/LF that supports a form of
 (interactive) theorem proving, where proofs are constructed as total
 functions. With this component, ATS advocates a programming style
 that combines programming with theorem proving. Furthermore, this
 component may be used as a logical framework to encode various
 deduction systems and their (meta-)properties.
 .
 This package contains the compiler patsopt and the frontend patscc.
