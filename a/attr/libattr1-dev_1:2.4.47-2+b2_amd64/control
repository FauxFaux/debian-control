Description: Extended attribute static libraries and headers
 attr-dev contains the libraries and header files needed to develop
 programs which make use of extended attributes.  For Linux programs,
 the documented system call API is the recommended interface, but an
 SGI IRIX compatibility interface is also provided.
 .
 Currently only ext2, ext3, JFS and XFS support extended attributes.
 The SGI IRIX compatibility API built above the Linux system calls is
 used by programs such as xfsdump(8), xfsrestore(8) and xfs_fsr(8).
