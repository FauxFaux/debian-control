Description: extraction of elements from LaTeX documents as graphics
 The purpose of preview is the extraction of selected elements from a
 LaTeX source, like formulas or graphics, into separate pages of a DVI
 file.  A flexible and convenient interface allows it to specify what
 commands and constructs should be extracted.  This works with DVI files
 postprocessed by either Dvips and Ghostscript or dvipng, but it also
 works when using PDFTeX for generating PDF files.
 .
 Currently, preview.sty is used by preview-latex, the WYSIWYG component of
 the AUCTeX editing environment; for generation of previews in LyX; as
 part of the operation of the ps4pdf and pst-pdf LaTeX packages; by the
 tbook XML system and some other tools.
