Description: gene prediction in eukaryotic genomes
 AUGUSTUS is a software for gene prediction in eukaryotic genomic sequences
 that is based on a generalized hidden Markov model (HMM), a probabilistic
 model of a sequence and its gene structure. After learning gene structures
 from a reference annotation, AUGUSTUS uses the HMM to recognize genes in a new
 sequence and annotates it with the regions of identified genes. External hints,
 e.g. from RNA sequencing, EST or protein alignments etc. can be used to guide
 and improve the gene finding process. The result is the set of most likely gene
 structures that comply with all given user constraints, if such gene
 structures exist.
 AUGUSTUS already includes prebuilt HMMs for many species, as well as scripts
 to train custom models using annotated genomes.
