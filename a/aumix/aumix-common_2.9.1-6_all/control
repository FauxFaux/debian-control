Description: Simple text-based mixer control program (common files)
 aumix is a small, easy-to-use program to control the mixer of your sound
 card. It runs in text mode using the ncurses library, or from the command
 line (non-interactively). It can read default settings from a file, and it
 can also automatically save and restore the mixer settings at shutdown and
 boot.
 .
 This package provides files common to aumix and aumix-gtk.
