Description: Simple text-based mixer control program
 aumix is a small, easy-to-use program to control the mixer of your sound
 card. It runs in text mode using the ncurses library, or from the command
 line (non-interactively). It can read default settings from a file, and it
 can also automatically save and restore the mixer settings at shutdown and
 boot.
 .
 A wrapper script xaumix is provided that finds and invokes xterm or a
 replacement. This is primarily for creating the best sized terminal window.
 If you want a true graphical interface, install aumix-gtk instead. That has
 the same functionality as this one in addition to offering a nice X GUI.
