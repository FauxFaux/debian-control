Description: simple music quiz game using your own music files
 auralquiz is a music quiz game that scans a users selected folder of music
 and creates a quiz using the tags from the audio files.  A sample of a
 random song is played and the player must answer a question about the
 sample from either multiple choice buttons or for hardcore difficulty,
 type in the correct answer. Up to 8 players can play in a turn based
 mode with scoring based on points, with more points given by answering
 the question faster.
