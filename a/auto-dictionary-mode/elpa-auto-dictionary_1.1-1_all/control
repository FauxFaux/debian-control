Description: automatic dictionary switcher for Emacs spell checking
 Auto-dictionary is a minor mode that hooks into Flyspell's on-the-fly spell
 checking and extends these checks to also detect language.  Auto-dictionary
 then sets 'ispell-dictionary' to use the detected language.  This package is
 useful for Emacs users who work in multiple languages (bilingual, multilingual,
 etc.)
 .
 Language detection is per buffer (per document), and auto-dictionary will
 choose whichever language is used most often.  If that document also contains
 language x and y, and has slightly more words from language x, but then
 document is edited until there are a greater number of words from language y,
 then auto-dictionary will change its pick to language y.  That is to say,
 auto-dictionary's pick always depends on the current state of the document, and
 it will only pick one language.  This package does not enable multiple
 dictionary support for Emacs ispell.
 .
 Auto-dictionary supports the following languages:
   * ca  - Catalan
   * da  - Dansk (Danish)
   * de  - Deutsch (German)
   * el  - νέα ελληνικά (Modern Greek)
   * en  - English
   * eo  - Esperanto
   * es  - Español (Spanish)
   * fr  - Français (French)
   * grc - ἑλληνικά (Classical Greek)
   * hi  - हिन्दी (Hindi)
   * hu  - Magyar (Hungarian)
   * nb  - Bokmål (Norwegian)
   * nn  - Nynorsk (Norwegian)
   * pt  - Português (Portuguese)
   * ro  - Românâ, Româneşte (Romanian)
   * sk  - Slovenčina (Slovak)
   * sl  - Slovenian (Slovene)
   * sv  - Svenska (Swedish)
