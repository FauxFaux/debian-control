Description: Automatically creates home and group directories for LDAP/NIS/SQL/local accounts
 A modular and thread-enabled tool to create and/or mounting and managing
 automagically and transparently user/group home directories, on demand.
 .
 It can work with any authentication framework (e.g. system files, NIS, LDAP or SQL)
 and does not require PAM, which is a required feature for session-less service
 such as smtp servers.

 Automounter version 4 (autofs4) has to be enabled when compiling the kernel.
