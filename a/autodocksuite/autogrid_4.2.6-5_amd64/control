Description: pre-calculate binding of ligands to their receptor
 The AutoDockSuite addresses the molecular analysis of the docking of
 a smaller chemical compounds to their receptors of known three-dimensional
 structure.
 .
 The AutoGrid program performs pre-calculations for the docking of a
 ligand to a set of grids that describe the effect that the protein has
 on point charges.  The effect of these forces on the ligand is then
 analysed by the AutoDock program.
