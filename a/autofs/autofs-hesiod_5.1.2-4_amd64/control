Description: Hesiod map support for autofs
 Autofs controls the operation of the automount daemons. The
 automount daemons automatically mount filesystems when they
 are used and unmount them after a period of inactivity. This
 is done based on a set of pre-configured maps.
 .
 The kernel automounter implements an almost complete SunOS
 style automounter under Linux. A recent version of the kernel
 autofs4 module (builtin or separate) is required.
 .
 This is the Hesiod module of the autofs.
