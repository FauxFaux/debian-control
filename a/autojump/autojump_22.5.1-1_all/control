Description: shell extension to jump to frequently used directories
 autojump provides a faster way to navigate your filesystem, with a
 "cd command that learns".
 .
 It works by maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from
 the command line, and allows you to "jump" to frequently used directories by
 typing only a small pattern.
 .
 To use autojump, you need to configure your shell to source
 /usr/share/autojump/autojump.sh on startup.
