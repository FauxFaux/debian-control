Description: create a skeleton source package for a new program
 autoproject interviews the user, then creates a source package for
 a new program which follows the GNU programming standards. The new
 package uses autoconf to configure itself, and automake to create
 the Makefile.
 .
 The idea is that you execute autoproject just once when you start
 a new project.  It will ask a few questions, then create a new
 directory and populate it with standard files, customized for the
 new project.
 .
 Optionally, the new package will use a command line parser generator.
 Currently, autoproject supports two parser generators: clig by Harald
 Kirsch <kir@iitb.fhg.de> (see http://wsd.iitb.fhg.de/software/), and
 autogen by Bruce Korb <bkorb@gnu.org> (see  http://autogen.sf.net/).
