Description: program to rename files to make them sort in given order
 This is a simple graphical program that lets you reorder the files using
 drag-and-drop and then changes the names of the files such that their
 alphabetical sorting matches the ordering you chose. You can also shuffle
 the files.
 .
 Currently the renaming consists of prepending each filename with a short
 number.
 .
 The program displays thumbnails of files using GNOME libraries.
