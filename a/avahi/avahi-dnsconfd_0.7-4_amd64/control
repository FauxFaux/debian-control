Description: Avahi DNS configuration tool
 Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery.
 It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts
 running on a local network with no specific configuration. For
 example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to
 print to, files to look at and people to talk to.
 .
 This tool listens on the network for announced DNS servers and passes
 them to resolvconf so it can use them. This is very useful on autoconfigured
 IPv6 networks.
