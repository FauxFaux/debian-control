Description: Avahi browsing, publishing and discovery utilities
 Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery.
 It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts
 running on a local network with no specific configuration.  For
 example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to
 print to, files to look at and people to talk to.
 .
 This package contains several utilities that allow you to interact with
 the Avahi daemon, including publish, browsing and discovering services.
