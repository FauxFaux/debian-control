Description: Development headers for the Avahi GLib integration library
 Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery.
 It allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts
 running on a local network with no specific configuration. For
 example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to
 print to, files to look at and people to talk to.
 .
 This package contains the development headers for the interface
 to integrate the Avahi libraries  into a GLib main loop application,
 including GTK+ applications.
