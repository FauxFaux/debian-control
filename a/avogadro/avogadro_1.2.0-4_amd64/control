Description: Molecular Graphics and Modelling System
 Avogadro is a molecular graphics and modelling system targeted at molecules
 and biomolecules.  It can visualize properties like molecular orbitals or
 electrostatic potentials and features an intuitive molecular builder.
 .
 Features include:
  * Molecular modeller with automatic force-field based geometry optimization
  * Molecular Mechanics including constraints and conformer searches
  * Visualization of molecular orbitals and general isosurfaces
  * Visualization of vibrations and plotting of vibrational spectra
  * Support for crystallographic unit cells
  * Input generation for the Gaussian, GAMESS and MOLPRO quantum chemistry
    packages
  * Flexible plugin architecture and Python scripting
 .
 File formats Avogadro can read include PDB, XYZ, CML, CIF, Molden, as well as
 Gaussian, GAMESS and MOLPRO output.
