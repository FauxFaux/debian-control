Description: Apache Avro C utilities (avro-c)
 Apache Avro is a data serialization system. Avro provides rich data
 structures; a binary data format; and a container file format, to store
 Avro-encoded data persistently.
 .
 This package provides the "avro-c" implementation of Apache Avro in C.
 The C implementation supports:
 .
  * binary encoding/decoding of all primitive and complex data types
  * storage to an Avro Object Container File
  * schema resolution, promotion and projection
  * validating and non-validating mode for writing Avro data
 .
 The C implementation of Avro lacks RPC support.
 .
 This package contains the avro-c command line utilities.
