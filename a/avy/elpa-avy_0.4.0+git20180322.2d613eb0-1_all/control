Description: jump to things in Emacs tree-style
 This package provides a generic completion method based on building
 a balanced decision tree with each candidate being a leaf.  To
 traverse the tree from the root to a desired leaf, typically a
 sequence of `read-key' can be used.
 .
 In order for `read-key' to make sense, the tree needs to be
 visualized appropriately, with a character at each branch node.  So
 this completion method works only for things that you can see on
 your screen, all at once:
 .
  * character positions
  * word or subword start positions
  * line beginning positions
  * link positions
  * window positions
 .
 If you're familiar with the popular `ace-jump-mode' package, this
 package does all that and more, without the implementation
 headache.
