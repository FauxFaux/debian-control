Description: highly configurable X window manager - documentation
 awesome manages windows dynamically in floating or tiled layouts. It is
 primarily targeted at power users, developers, and all those dealing with
 everyday computing tasks and looking for fine-grained control over their
 graphical environment.
 .
 It is highly extensible and scriptable via the Lua programming language,
 providing an easy-to-use and very well documented API to configure its
 behavior.
 .
 awesome uses tags instead of workspaces, which gives better flexibility
 in displaying windows, and can be entirely keyboard-driven, not needing a
 mouse. It also supports multi-headed configurations; uses XCB instead of
 Xlib for better performance; implements many freedesktop standards; and
 can be controlled over D-Bus from awesome-client.
 .
 This package contains the API documentation for awesome.
