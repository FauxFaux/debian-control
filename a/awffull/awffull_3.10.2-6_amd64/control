Description: web server log analysis program
 AWFFull is a Web server log analysis program, forked from Webalizer. It adds a
 number of new features and improvements, such as extended frontpage history,
 resizable graphs, and a few more pie charts.
 .
 Webalizer is a great weblog analysis program but hasn't been going anywhere in
 recent years. AWFFull takes that base and starts to fix the niggles and
 annoyances and hopefully become a useful enhancement.
 .
 As a base, weblizer has a stated goal of producing web server analysis.
 AWFFull on the other hand, will gradually focus more on the business
 intelligence contained within those logs - and not specifically limited just to
 web server logs.
 .
 Major Enhancements vs. Webalizer
 .
 The frontpage history can now cover more than 12 months.
 StyleSheets (CSS) are supported. Customise to your hearts content!
 The log type can be auto-detected
 Can process: CLF, Combined, Squid, FTP XFER and Domino v6 Logs
 All graphs are now resizable, rather than being a fixed size
 Config File simplification to reduce duplication of common config pairings
 Bookmarking numbers are tracked. Be aware that these are estimates!
 Backend changes: Use of PCRE lib and standard library calls to ease coding pain
 Pattern Matching improvements can increase the speed of a run by 50%. YMMV!
 404 Errors are tracked and displayed with both the target and referrering URL
 Can specify what is a page or what is not.
