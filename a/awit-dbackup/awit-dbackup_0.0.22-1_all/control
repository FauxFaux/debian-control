Description: Flexible one archive per directory backup tool
 This is a backup software package which basically creates one
 archive per directory it backs up. This makes searching
 through the backup much easier as you can look for which files
 you're after in the directory hierarchy. It will only backup
 directories which have changed, which makes it rsync friendly.
