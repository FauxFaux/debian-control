Description: Trie-based DNA sequencing read demultiplexer
 Axe very rapidly selects the optimal barcode present in a sequence read, even
 in the presence of sequencing errors. The algorithm is able to handle
 combinatorial barcoding, barcodes of differing length, and several mismatches
 per barcode.
