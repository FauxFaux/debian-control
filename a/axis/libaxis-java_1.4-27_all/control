Description: SOAP implementation in Java
 Apache AXIS is an implementation of the SOAP ("Simple Object Access Protocol")
 submission to W3C.
 .
 From the draft W3C specification:
 .
 SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a decentralized,
 distributed environment. It is an XML based protocol that consists of three
 parts: an envelope that defines a framework for describing what is in a message
 and how to process it, a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of
 application-defined datatypes, and a convention for representing remote
 procedure calls and responses.
 .
 This project is a follow-on to the Apache SOAP project.
