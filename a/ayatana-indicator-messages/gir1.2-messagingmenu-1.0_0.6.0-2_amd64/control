Description: Ayatana Messaging Menu - gir bindings
 A place on the user's desktop that collects messages that need a response.

 for quick access, but without making them annoying in times that you want
 to ignore them.
 .
 This package can be used by other packages using the GIRepository format
 to generate dynamic bindings.
