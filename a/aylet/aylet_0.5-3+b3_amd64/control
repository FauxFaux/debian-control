Description: ncurses-based player for Spectrum '.ay' music files
 aylet plays music files in the `.ay' format. These files are
 essentially wrappers around bits of Z80 code which play music on the
 Sinclair ZX Spectrum 128's sound hardware - either the beeper, or
 (eponymously) the AY-3-8912 sound chip. Files using the Amstrad CPC
 ports are also supported.
 .
 One source of `.ay' files playable with aylet is "Project AY"
 on the World of Spectrum website:
