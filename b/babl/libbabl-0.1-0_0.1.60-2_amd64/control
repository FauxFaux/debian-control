Description: Dynamic, any to any, pixel format conversion library
 Babl is a dynamic, any to any, pixel format conversion library. It
 provides conversions between the myriad of buffer types images can be
 stored in. Babl doesn't only help with existing pixel formats, but
 also facilitates creation of new and uncommon ones.
