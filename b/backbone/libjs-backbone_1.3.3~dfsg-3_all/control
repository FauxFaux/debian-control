Description: some Backbone for JavaScript applications - browser library
 Backbone gives structure to your serious JavaScript web applications by
 supplying models with key-value binding and custom events, collections
 with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event
 handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON
 interface.
 .
 This package contains backbone usable directly in web browsers.
 .
 RESTful persistence and DOM manipulation with Backbone.View requires
 either of the packages libjs-jquery libjs-lodash, and libjs-json for
 older Internet Explorer support.
 .
 Optimal rendering of upstream index.html requires the package
 libjs-jquery-lazyload.
