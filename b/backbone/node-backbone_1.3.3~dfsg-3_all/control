Description: some Backbone for JavaScript applications - Node module
 Node is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
 .
 Backbone gives structure to your serious JavaScript web applications by
 supplying models with key-value binding and custom events, collections
 with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event
 handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON
 interface.
 .
 This package contains node-uuid usable with Node.
 .
 Optimal rendering of upstream index.html requires the package
 libjs-jquery-lazyload.
