Description: Patch 32/64 bits ELF & win32/64 binaries with shellcode
 Injects shellcode into win32/64 PE files, 32/64bits ELF binaries, to continue
 normal file execution (if the shellcode supports it), by patching the exe/dll
 directly.
 .
 Some executables have built in protections, as such this will not work on all
 ELF/PE files. It is advisable that you test target ELF/PE files before
 deploying them to clients or using them in exercises
