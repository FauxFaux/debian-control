Description: Backport of the Python 3.5 SSL hostname checking function
 The Secure Sockets layer is only actually secure if you check the
 hostname in the certificate returned by the server to which you are
 connecting, and verify that it matches to hostname that you are trying
 to reach.
 .
 But the matching logic, defined in RFC2818, can be a bit tricky to
 implement on your own. So the ssl package in the Standard Library of
 Python 3.2 and greater now includes a match_hostname() function for
 performing this check instead of requiring every application to
 implement the check separately.
 .
 This package contains a backport of the ssl.match_hostname function for
 Python 2.4 and above.
