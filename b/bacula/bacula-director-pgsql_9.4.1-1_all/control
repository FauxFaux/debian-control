Description: network backup service - PostgreSQL storage for Director
 Bacula is a set of programs to manage backup, recovery and verification of
 data across a network of computers of different kinds.
 .
 The Bacula Director service supervises all the backup, restore, verify and
 archive operations. It can run as a daemon or as a foreground service which
 administrators can use to schedule backups and recover files.
 .
 This package stores Bacula's catalog in a PostgreSQL database and thus is
 suited for large installations.
