Description: data files for balder2d
 In Balder2D, players control small probes which shoot tiny projectiles with
 which they try to destroy each other. It features a 2D overhead view of the
 playing field. Probes may be human or computer controlled.
 .
 A probe can perform the following actions:
 .
    * rotate
    * fire projectiles
    * "stick" to a wall
    * push off of a wall
 .
 Players may rotate their probes while in flight, but the only way to change
 the direction or speed of flight is by firing projectiles (which gives a
 small kick in the opposite direction) or by running into walls or other probes.
 .
 These are the common files for balder2d.
