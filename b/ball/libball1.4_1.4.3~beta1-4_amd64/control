Description: Biochemical Algorithms Library
 BALL (Biochemical Algorithms Library) is an application framework
 in C++ that has been specifically designed for rapid software
 development in Molecular Modeling and Computational Molecular Biology.
 It provides an extensive set of data structures as well as classes
 for Molecular Mechanics, advanced solvation methods, comparison and
 analysis of protein structures, file import/export, and visualization.
 BALL is currently being developed in the groups of Oliver Kohlbacher
 (University of Tuebingen, Germany), Andreas Hildebrandt (Saarland
 University, Saarbruecken, Germany), and Hans-Peter Lenhof (Saarland
 University, Saarbruecken, Germany).
 .
 This package contains the view - independent parts of BALL (libBALL,
 data directories et al., except for libVIEW) and can be installed on
 machines without X11.
