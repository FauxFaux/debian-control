Description: GObject introspection data for the Bamf library
 Bamf matches application windows to desktop files. It removes the
 headache of applications matching into a simple DBus daemon and C
 wrapper library. It currently features application matching at amazing
 levels of accuracy (covering nearly every corner case).
 .
 This package contains introspection data for the Bamf library.
 .
 It can be used by packages using the GIRepository format to generate
 dynamic bindings.
