Description: Window matching library - development files
 Bamf matches application windows to desktop files. It removes the
 headache of applications matching into a simple DBus daemon and C
 wrapper library. It currently features application matching at amazing
 levels of accuracy (covering nearly every corner case).
 .
 This package contains files that are needed to build applications.
