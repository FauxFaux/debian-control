Description: dynamic library for manipulating BAM (genome alignment) files
 BamTools facilitates research analysis and data management using BAM
 files.  It copes with the enormous amount of data produced by current
 sequencing technologies that is typically stored in compressed, binary
 formats that are not easily handled by the text-based parsers commonly
 used in bioinformatics research.
 .
 BamTools provides both a C++ API for BAM file support as well as a
 command-line toolkit.
 .
 This is the runtime library.
