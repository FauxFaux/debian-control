Description: Automatic Playlist Generation extension for Banshee
 Mirage is a ready-to-try implementation of the latest research
 in automatic playlist generation and music similarity. Mirage
 analyzes your music collection and computes similarity models
 for each song. After your music has been analyzed, Mirage is
 able to automatically generate playlists of similar music.
 .
 Mirage is far from being perfect! But it is a nice and easy way
 to rediscover your music collection. Imagine it's an automated
 radio station DJ playing songs from your collection and all songs
 somehow fit together.
 .
 Banshee is a media management and playback application for the GNOME desktop.
