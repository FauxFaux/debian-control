Description: Telepathy extension for Banshee
 This extension provides integration between the Empathy instant messenger and
 Banshee. It provides the following features:
 .
  * Download your friends' Banshee library metadata and check out what they
    listen to, their ratings, BPM values, etc.
  * View your friends' playlists and export them to disk
  * Share what you're listening to with all your instant messaging friends by
    advertising the track, artist, and album of the currently playing track in
    Empathy's status message. This can be disabled.
  * Download your friends' music; one track at a time or a selection. You can
    cancel ones in progress, queued, individually or all at once. The sender has
    the option to cancel all in progress or queued transfers only. Both sender
    and receiver get a progress bar. File sharing can be disabled.
  * Stream your friends' music. This feature can be disabled.
 .
 Banshee is a media management and playback application for the GNOME desktop.
