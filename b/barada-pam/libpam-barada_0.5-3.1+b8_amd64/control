Description: PAM module to provide two-factor authentication based on HOTP
 Use HOTP (RFC4226) two-factor authentication with PAM.
 .
 In addition to a normal password, users are also assigned a 128 bit key and
 arbitrary-length PIN number. Every time you'd like to login using a OTP, you
 calculate a secure hash based on your assigned PIN and an increasing counter,
 the result of which is a six character one time password.
 .
 While this module could be used in conjunction with many different
 client devices, it was written specifically with Android devices in
 mind.  There is companion software which runs on Android, so that your
 phone essentially becomes a SecureID token.  All you need to do is
 open up the software, type in your PIN, and you get back a 6-character
 number that you can use to login to your system.
