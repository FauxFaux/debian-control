Description: Backup Archiving Recovery Open Sourced - storage daemon tape support
 Bareos is a set of programs to manage backup, recovery and verification of
 data across a network of computers of different kinds.
 .
 The storage daemon performs the storage and recovery of the file
 attributes and data to the physical media; in other words, it is
 responsible for reading and writing the backups.
 .
 It runs on the machine which has access to the backup device(s) - usually
 a tape drive, but alternatively other storage media, such as files.
 .
 This adds the tape specific support files for the storage daemon.
