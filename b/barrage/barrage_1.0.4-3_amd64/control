Description: Rather destructive action game
 Barrage is a rather destructive action game that puts you on a shooting
 range with the objective to hit as many dummy targets as possible
 within 3 minutes. You control a gun which may either fire small or large
 grenades at dummy soldiers, jeeps and tanks. The gameplay is simple but
 it is not that easy to get high scores.
