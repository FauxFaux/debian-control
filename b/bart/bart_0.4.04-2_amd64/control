Description: tools for computational magnetic resonance imaging
 The Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (BART) is a free and
 open-source image-reconstruction framework for Computational Magnetic
 Resonance Imaging. It consists of a programming library and a toolbox
 of command-line programs. The library provides common operations on
 multi-dimensional arrays, Fourier and wavelet transforms, as well as
 generic implementations of iterative optimization algorithms. The
 command-line tools provide direct access to basic operations on
 multi-dimensional arrays as well as efficient implementations of
 many calibration and reconstruction algorithms for parallel imaging
 and compressed sensing.
