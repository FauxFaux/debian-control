Description: educational BASIC programming environment for children
 BASIC-256 is an easy to use version of BASIC designed to teach young
 children the basics of computer programming. It uses traditional
 control structures like gosub, for/next, and goto, which helps kids
 easily see how program flow-control works. It has a built-in graphics
 mode which lets them draw pictures on screen in minutes, and a set
 of detailed, easy-to-follow tutorials that introduce programming
 concepts through fun exercises.
