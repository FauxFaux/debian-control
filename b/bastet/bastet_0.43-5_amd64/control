Description: ncurses Tetris clone with a bastard algorithm
 Bastet ("bastard Tetris") is a free clone of Tetris which tries to
 compute how useful blocks are and gives you the worst possible brick.
 Playing bastet can be a painful experience, especially if you usually
 make "canyons" and wait for the long I-shaped block.
