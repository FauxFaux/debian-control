Description: B.A.T.M.A.N. advanced control and management tool
 This package contains batctl, which serves as configuration utility,
 monitoring and debugging application. It allows one to modify the module
 parameters, reading the logfiles and tables, decapsulate embedded packets on
 the fly, traceroute to and ping mac addresses, generate sequence number graphs
 for the Layer 2 Mesh B.A.T.M.A.N.
 .
 B.A.T.M.A.N. (better approach to mobile ad-hoc networking) is a new routing
 protocol for multi-hop ad-hoc mesh networks. B.A.T.M.A.N.-advanced is the
 implementation of this protocol on ISO/OSI Layer 2, allowing mesh networks to
 be used as a virtual switch. With this approach, LANs and WANs can be easily
 integrated, and more protocols (like DHCP, IPv6) are supported.
