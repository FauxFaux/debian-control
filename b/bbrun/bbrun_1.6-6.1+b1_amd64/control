Description: A tool for the blackbox/fluxbox window managers that runs commands
 bbrun is a small but very useful application. It makes it convenient to quickly
 execute commands from the blackbox window manager. bbrun is very similar to
 KDE's Alt+F2 Run Command dialog box. When launched, it occupies a small portion
 of the desktop and docks itself to the right side of the screen. The run dialog
 is opened by clicking a tiny bbrun icon.

 You don't necessarily need blackbox for this program to work. It looks just as
 good in fluxbox, but it won't look the same in other window managers.
