Description: Interface for toggling the power on NVIDIA Optimus video cards
 bbswitch is a kernel module which automatically detects the required ACPI
 calls for two kinds of Optimus laptops. It has been verified to work with
 "real" Optimus and "legacy" Optimus laptops (at least, that is what the
 author Lekensteyn calls those).
 .
 This package contains source code only, and is intended to be used with
 module-assistant to build the bbswitch kernel module.
