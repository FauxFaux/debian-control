Description: Time tool for the blackbox/fluxbox window managers
 bbtime is a blackbox tool to display the system time in your
 blackbox slit. It can also display other times as an offset
 of your local time in a menu.
 .
 Note that you don't actually need blackbox or fluxbox for this program
 to work, but it won't look as good in other window managers.
