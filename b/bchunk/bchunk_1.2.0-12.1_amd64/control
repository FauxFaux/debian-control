Description: CD image format conversion from bin/cue to iso/cdr
 The bchunk package contains a UNIX/C rewrite of the BinChunker program.
 BinChunker converts a CD image in a .bin/.cue format (sometimes .raw/.cue) into
 a set of .iso and .cdr/.wav tracks. The .bin/.cue format is used by some
 non-UNIX CD-writing software, but is not supported on most other CD-writing
 programs.
