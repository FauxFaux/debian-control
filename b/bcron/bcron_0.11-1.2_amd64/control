Description: Bruce cron system (programs)
 This is bcron, a new cron system designed with secure operations in mind.
 To do this, the system is divided into several separate programs, each
 responsible for a separate task, with strictly controlled communications
 between them.  The user interface is a drop-in replacement for similar
 systems (such as vixie-cron), but the internals differ greatly.
 .
 This package contains the bcron programs.
