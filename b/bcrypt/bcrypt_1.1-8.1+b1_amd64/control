Description: Cross platform file encryption utility using blowfish (Decrypt only)
 WARNING: decrypt-only Debian package. Encryption disabled.
 See http://bugs.debian.org/700758.
 Bcrypt is a cross platform file encryption utility.  Encrypted files are
 portable across all supported operating systems and processors.  In addition
 to encrypting your data, bcrypt will by default overwrite the original input
 file with random garbage three times before deleting it in order to thwart
 data recovery attempts by persons who may gain access to your computer.
 Bcrypt uses the blowfish encryption algorithm published by Bruce Schneier in
 1993.
