Description: quickly go back to a specific parent directory in bash
 bd allows you to go to a parent directory in bash instead of typing
 "cd ../../.." redundantly.
 .
 You can simply type backdir with starting few letters and it will auto
 complete the directory name.
 .
 It can be used with other commands such as ls, ln, echo, zip, tar, etc.
