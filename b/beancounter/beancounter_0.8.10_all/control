Description: A stock portfolio performance monitoring tool
 This package provides beancounter, a tool to quantify gains and losses in
 stock portfolios, as well as the BeanCounter Perl module that underlies it.
 Beancounter queries stock prices from Yahoo! Finance server(s) around the
 globe and stores them in a relational database (using PostgreSQL) so
 that the data can be used for further analysis.  Canned performance and
 risk reports are available.
