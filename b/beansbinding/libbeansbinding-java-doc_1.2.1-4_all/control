Description: Beans Binding API (documentation)
 In essence, Beans Binding (JSR 295) is about keeping
 two properties (typically of two objects) in sync.
 An additional emphasis is placed on the ability
 to bind to Swing components, and easy integration
 with IDEs such as NetBeans. This project provides
 the reference implementation.

 This package contains Javadoc API documentation.
