Description: error-tolerant HTML parser for Python
 The BeautifulSoup class turns arbitrarily bad HTML into a tree-like nested
 tag-soup list of Tag objects and text snippets. A Tag object corresponds to
 an HTML tag.  It knows about the HTML tag's attributes, and contains a
 representation of everything contained between the original tag and its
 closing tag (if any). It's easy to extract Tags that meet certain criteria.
