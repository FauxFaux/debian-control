Description: binary editor and viewer
 beav (Binary Editor And Viewer) is an editor for binary files containing
 arbitrary data. Text file editors, on the other hand, expect the files they
 edit to contain textual data, and/or to be formatted in a certain way (e.g.
 lines of printable characters delimited by newline characters).
 .
 With beav, you can edit a file in HEX, ASCII, EBCDIC, OCTAL, DECIMAL, and
 BINARY. You can display but not edit data in FLOAT mode. You can search or
 search and replace in any of these modes. Data can be displayed in BYTE,
 WORD, or DOUBLE WORD formats. While displaying WORDS or DOUBLE WORDS the
 data can be displayed in INTEL's or MOTOROLA's byte ordering. Data of any
 length can be inserted at any point in the file. The source of this data
 can be the keyboard, another buffer, or a file. Any data that is being
 displayed can be sent to a printer in the displayed format. Files that are
 bigger than memory can be handled.
