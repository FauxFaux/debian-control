Description: redefine M-< and M-> for some modes to get to meaningful locations
 This package redefines M-< and M-> (or any key bound to
 beginning-of-buffer or end-of-buffer) for some modes so that point
 moves to meaningful locations. The real beginning and end of buffers
 (i. e., point-min and point-max) are still accessible by pressing the
 same key again.
