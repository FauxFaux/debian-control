Description: language recognition library by Belledonne Communications
 Belr is Belledonne Communications' language recognition library. It aims
 at parsing any input formatted according to a language defined by an
 ABNF grammar, such as the protocols standardized at IETF.
 .
 It is based on finite state machine theory and heavily relies on
 recursivity from an implementation standpoint.
 .
 The package is probably not useful outside the Belledonne Communications suite
 of libraries and programs.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
