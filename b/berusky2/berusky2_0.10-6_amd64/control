Description: logic game Bugs Escape 3D
 The game based on Berusky that is also available for Debian, though this is
 the enhanced 3D version. Berusky II is a game that challenges your
 visual/spatial thinking and the ability to find a way to resolve a logic task.
 .
 The entire game takes place in a 3D environment while you slip into the role
 of different bugs and lead them out of a maze. In addition to arbitrary
 turning and level zooming all logical plots happen in space.
 .
 In comparison to the first part, new logical elements, a simple linear story
 accompanied by comic series, various 3D environments, water surfaces and
 others have been added.
