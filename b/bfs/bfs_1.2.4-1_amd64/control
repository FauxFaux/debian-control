Description: Breadth-first version of find(1)
 bfs is a variant of the UNIX `find` command that operates breadth-first rather
 than depth-first.
 .
 It tries to be easier to use than `find`, while remaining compatible with
 find(1). For example, bfs is less picky about where you put its arguments.
 bfs also adds some extra options that make some common tasks easier.
 .
 When bfs detects that its output is a terminal, it automatically colors its
 output with the same colors ls uses.
