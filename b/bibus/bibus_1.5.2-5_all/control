Description: bibliographic database
 Bibus is a bibliographic database which has been developed with LibreOffice/
 OpenOffice.org in mind. It can directly insert citations and format the
 bibliographic index in an open OpenOffice.org Writer document. The main
 features are
  * hierarchical organization of the references with user-defined keys
  * designed for multiuser-environments (share databases between users)
  * a search engine supporting live queries
  * on-line PubMed access
  * import of PubMed (Medline), EndNote/Refer, RIS and BibTeX records.
 .
 Bibus will use an SQLite-database by default for storage (via the SQLite3
 module available in Python >2.5). But it also supports MySQL-databases.
 If you want to use a MySQL-database, make sure, that you have the
 python-mysqldb package installed.
