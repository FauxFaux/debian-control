Description: BiDi viewer - command-line tool displaying logical Hebrew/Arabic
 bidiv is a simple utility for converting logical-Hebrew input to visual-Hebrew
 output. This is useful for reading Hebrew mail messages, viewing Hebrew texts,
 etc. It was written for Hebrew but Arabic (or other BiDi languages) should
 work equally well.
