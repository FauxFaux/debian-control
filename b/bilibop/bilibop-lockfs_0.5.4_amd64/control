Description: lock filesystems and write changes into RAM
 Bilibop helps to maintain a Debian GNU/Linux operating system installed
 on an external media (USB, FireWire, Flash memory, eSATA). It hardens
 standard rules and policies to make the system more robust in this
 particular situation.
 .
 If the lockfs feature is enabled (in a configuration file, in the boot
 commandline or by a heuristic), nothing will be written on the filesystems
 listed in /etc/fstab, except for those that have been whitelisted, or for
 the encrypted swap devices. More, bilibop-lockfs now is able to detect if
 the drive has been locked by a physical switch, and then overrides its own
 settings to unconditionally apply a 'hard' policy.
 .
 The root filesystem is locked (set readonly, using either aufs or overlay)
 by an initramfs script which also modifies the temporary fstab to prepare
 other filesystems to be locked later by a mount helper script.
 .
 bilibop-lockfs provides the following features:
  * whitelist based policy: filesystems on which you want to allow persistent
    changes must be explicitly listed in a configuration file.
  * swap devices policy: they can be used 'as is', noauto, only if encrypted,
    only if encrypted with a random key, or not used at all.
  * not only filesystems are set read-only, but also block devices: this
    forbids changes of the partition table, boot sectors, LUKS headers and
    LVM metadata.
  * plymouth messages to know at boot time if bilibop-lockfs is enabled or
    not, or if an error occurred.
  * desktop notifications at startup about filesystems status, to inform the
    user that volatile or persistent changes are allowed or not, and where.
 .
 This package can be used as an alternative to fsprotect or overlayroot,
 especially for writable operating systems embedded on a USB stick; but it
 may also be installed on public or personal computers, for daily use,
 kiosks, testing purposes, or as a tool in anti-forensics strategies.
 .
 Some features may require Linux kernel 2.6.37 or higher to work properly.
