Description: device management rules for OS running from external media
 Bilibop helps to maintain a Debian GNU/Linux operating system installed
 on an external media (USB, FireWire, Flash memory, eSATA). It hardens
 standard rules and policies to make the system more robust in this
 particular situation.
 .
 This package provides a udev rules file to manage the external drive hosting
 the running system. Its main goal is to forbid low-level write access on this
 drive and its partitions by any unprivileged user or application, but some
 other convenient and optional rules have been added for desktop-level
 management (in desktop environments based on udisks2) of the system disk and
 partitions, as well as the internal disks of the computer. The 'lsbilibop'
 command allows the admin to update udev properties of the devices after the
 configuration file has been modified.
 .
 To ease device management, bilibop-rules also provides helper scripts to:
  * build custom bilibop udev rules running faster than the generic ones
  * make some persistent and cumulative udev rules files unpersistent
  * use either a fake or an always-up-to-date grub device map
  * filter Physical Volumes, to activate only those needed by the system
 .
 This package is not designed to be used on internal disks. It works only
 for OS installed on removable and writable media, including LiveUSB systems.
 See also the bilibop-udev package.
 .
 Some features may require Linux kernel 2.6.37 or higher to work properly.
