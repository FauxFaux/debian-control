Description: minimal udev rule for Debian GNU/Linux running from external media
 Bilibop helps to maintain a Debian GNU/Linux operating system installed
 on an external media (USB, FireWire, Flash memory, eSATA). It hardens
 standard rules and policies to make the system more robust in this
 particular situation.
 .
 This package provides a udev rules file to manage the external drive hosting
 the running system. Its goal is to forbid low-level write access on this
 drive and its partitions by any unprivileged user or application.
 .
 This package is not designed to be used on internal disks. It works only
 for OS installed on removable and writable media, especially LiveUSB systems
 and disk images provided by most vendors of popular ARM-based development
 boards. See also the bilibop-rules package.
 .
 Some features may require Linux kernel 2.6.37 or higher to work properly.
