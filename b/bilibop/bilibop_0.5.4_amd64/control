Description: run Debian GNU/Linux from external media - metapackage
 Bilibop helps to maintain a Debian GNU/Linux operating system installed
 on an external media (USB, FireWire, Flash memory, eSATA). It hardens
 standard rules and policies to make the system more robust in this
 particular situation.
 .
 The installation of this metapackage will install other BILIBOP packages
 as dependencies. You should not install it, unless your system is writable
 and runs from an external device.
 .
 Some features may require Linux kernel 2.6.37 or higher to work properly.
