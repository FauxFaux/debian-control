Description: type-safe binary serialization for OCaml values (dev files)
 bin-prot provides functionalities for reading and writing OCaml-values
 in a type-safe binary protocol.
 .
 These functions provide a safe way of performing I/O on any
 extensionally defined data type. Functions, objects, and values whose
 type is bound through a polymorphic record field are not supported, but
 everything else is.
 .
 There is no support for cyclic or shared values and only little endian
 computer architectures are supported.
 .
 This package contains development files.
