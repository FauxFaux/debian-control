Description: Empirical stochastic bandwidth tester
 Bing is a point-to-point bandwidth measurement tool (hence the 'b'),
 based on ping.
 .
 Bing determines the real (raw, as opposed to available or average)
 throughput on a link by measuring ICMP echo requests' round trip times
 for different packet sizes at each end of the link.
