Description: logic game with arcade and tactics modes
 Biniax-2 is an original and entertaining game. It only takes a minute to learn
 and gives you hours and hours of gameplay. There are three game modes (two
 singleplayer and one multiplayer), hall of fame, dynamic music and a nice
 cartoon look.
