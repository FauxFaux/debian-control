Description: GNU assembler, linker and binary utilities for the build architecture
 The programs in this package are used to assemble, link and manipulate
 binary and object files for the native architecture.  They may be used in
 conjunction with a build architecture compiler and various libraries to build
 programs. When using binutils through this metapackage, tools without an
 architecture prefix must be used.
