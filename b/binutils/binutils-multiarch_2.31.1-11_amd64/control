Description: Binary utilities that support multi-arch targets
 The programs in this package are used to manipulate binary and object
 files that may have been created on other architectures.  This package
 is primarily for multi-architecture developers and cross-compilers and
 is not needed by normal users or developers.  Note that a cross-assembling
 version of gas is not included in this package, just the binary utilities.
 .
 NORMAL USERS SHOULD NOT INSTALL THIS PACKAGE.  It's meant only for those
 requiring support for reading info from binaries from other architectures.
