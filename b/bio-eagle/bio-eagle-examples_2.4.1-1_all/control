Description: Examples for bio-eagle
 Eagle estimates haplotype phase either within a genotyped cohort or using a
 phased reference panel. The basic idea of the Eagle1 algorithm is to harness
 identity-by-descent among distant relatives—which is pervasive at very large
 sample sizes but rare among smaller numbers of samples—to rapidly call phase
 using a fast scoring approach. In contrast, the Eagle2 algorithm analyzes a
 full probabilistic model similar to the diploid Li-Stephens model used by
 previous HMM-based methods.
