Description: Java API to biological data and applications (default version)
 BioJava is an open-source project dedicated to providing a Java framework
 for processing biological data. It includes objects for manipulating
 sequences, file parsers, DAS client and server support, access to BioSQL
 and Ensembl databases, and powerful analysis and statistical routines
 including a dynamic programming toolkit.
 .
 BioJava is provided by a vibrant community which meets annually at
 the Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) that traditionally
 accompanies the Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology (ISMB)
 meeting. Much like BioPerl, the employment of this library is valuable
 for everybody active in the field because of the many tricks of the
 trade one learns just by communicating on the mailing list.
 .
 This is a wrapper package which should enable smooth upgrades to new
 versions.
