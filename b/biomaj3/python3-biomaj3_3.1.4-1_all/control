Description: BioMAJ workflow management library
 BioMAJ downloads remote data banks, checks their status and applies
 transformation workflows, with consistent state, to provide ready-to-use
 data for biologists and bioinformaticians. For example, it can transform
 original FASTA files into BLAST indexes. It is very flexible and its
 post-processing facilities can be extended very easily.
 .
 BioMAJ3 is a rewrite of BioMAJ v1.x, see online documentation for migration.
 .
 This package contains the library to manage the workflow update in BioMAJ3,
 it is managed via python3-biomaj3-daemon (for microservices remote operations)
 or biomaj3-cli (local or remote) packages
