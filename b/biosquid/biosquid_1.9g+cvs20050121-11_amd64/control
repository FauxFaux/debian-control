Description: utilities for biological sequence analysis
 SQUID is a library of C code functions for sequence analysis. It also
 includes a number of small utility programs to convert, show statistics,
 manipulate and do other functions on sequence files.
 .
 The original name of the package is "squid", but since there is already
 a squid on the archive (a proxy cache), it was renamed to "biosquid".
 .
 This package contains some tools to demonstrate the features of the
 SQUID library.
