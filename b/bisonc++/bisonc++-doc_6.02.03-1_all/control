Description: Bison-style parser generator for C++ documentation
 Bisonc++ was designed after `bison++', created by Alain Coetmeur. Bisonc++
 adds to bison++ a cleaner class-design, using a base-class to communicate
 lexical tokens to a lexical scanner.
 .
 Since bisonc++ generates the parser class as well as the parsing
 function. The class can easily be provided with additional members without
 needing polymorphic functions. Consequently, classes generated by bisonc++
 have no virtual members and actually have but one public member: parse(),
 replacing the old-style bison and bison++ yyparse() function.
 .
 Bisonc++ offers many options, among which an option to define classes
 generated by bisonc++ in a separate namespace. This allows developers to
 define additional symbols, even outside of the class generated by bisonc++,
 without encountering name-collision problems. With bisonc++, artificial means
 to prevent name-collisions, like bison and bison++'s yy-convention are not
 required anymore when using bisonc++.  Bisonc++ merely generates C++ code. If
 C code is required, bison should be used. Bisonc++'s grammar requirements are
 highly compatible with bison's requirements, so converting a bison grammar
 into a bisonc++ grammar should be fairly simple.
 .
 In addition to the bisonc++ parser generator itself and several skeleton
 files, the package contains an extensive man-page, a full manual rewritten
 after the original bison manual, and several examples.
 .
 Some history: Bisonc++ versions 0.98 is a complete rewrite of an LALR(1)
 parser generator, as described in Aho, Sethi and Ullman's (1986) book
 `Compilers' (a.k.a. the `Dragon Book'). Version 0.98 was completed in May
 2005. Another major rewrite was completed one year later, May 2006, resulting
 in version 1.00.
 .
 This package provides the supplemental documentation for Bisonc++.
