Description: BitBabbler hardware TRNG and kernel entropy source support
 This package provides supporting software for the BitBabbler true random
 number generator hardware.  It includes:
 .
  - The seedd daemon for running continuous quality and health checks on
    the active devices and the stream of entropy that they provide, and
    for seeding the OS kernel entropy pool on demand.
  - Monitoring tools for short and long term analysis, and alerting of
    anomalies in both the BitBabbler output and the kernel /dev/random
    and /dev/urandom output.
  - Admin tools for real-time inspection of the short and long term
    quality metrics.
 .
 You will need to install libjson-xs-perl if you wish to use the munin-node
 script for continuous graphing and monitoring of device performance.
 .
 You will need to install libvirt-clients if you want hotplug support for
 adding devices to libvirt managed virtual machines.
