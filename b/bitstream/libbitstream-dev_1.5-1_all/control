Description: C headers giving access to binary streams like MPEG or DVB
 biTStream is a set of C headers allowing a simpler access
 to binary structures such as specified by MPEG, DVB, IETF,
 etc.
 .
 The goal of this package is to offer a simpler access that
 libdvbpsi does currently. This package is also lower level
 and more efficient: fewer memory allocations, fewer memory
 copies.
