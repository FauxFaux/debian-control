Description: Original BitTorrent client - GUI tools
 BitTorrent is a tool for distributing files. It's extremely
 easy to use - downloads are started by clicking on hyperlinks.
 Whenever more than one person is downloading at once
 they send pieces of the file(s) to each other, thus relieving
 the central server's bandwidth burden. Even with many
 simultaneous downloads, the upload burden on the central server
 remains quite small, since each new downloader introduces new
 upload capacity.
 .
 This package contains the GUI tools for downloading.
