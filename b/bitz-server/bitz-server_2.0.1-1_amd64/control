Description: ICAP server (RFC 3507) implementation in C++
 The main goal of this project is to create an ICAP server (RFC 3507)
 implementation in C++ to use the power of object oriented programming.
 .
 Starting from scratch, the server is developed with a modular architecture
 in mind. The server core (written in C++) will handle the client requests,
 manage workers (child processes) etc. and will provide basic handlers to serve
 ICAP requests.
 .
 To extend this core functionality the idea is to have pluggable modules
 (like Apache server modules). These modules will provide features like
 content filtering, anti-virus scanning etc. and to make it easier to write
 (and faster to implement) such modules there is hope to exploit Python
 programming language.
