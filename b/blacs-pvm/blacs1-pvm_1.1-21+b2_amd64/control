Description: Basic Linear Algebra Comm. Subprograms - Shared libs. for PVM
 The BLACS project is an ongoing investigation whose purpose is to
 create a linear algebra oriented message passing interface that may be
 implemented efficiently and uniformly across a large range of
 distributed memory platforms.
 .
 You can choose between an implementation based on MPI or PVM. This
 package uses PVM.
 .
 There are packages for the shared libraries (this one), for the
 static libraries and the development files and for test programs.
 .
 Most users do not need to install this package directly because it is
 used as a high level driver for the communication in the ScaLAPACK packages.
 Therefore, it is installed when installing ScaLAPACK. ScaLAPACK is a
 parallel version of LAPACK and is used on Beowulf type clusters.
