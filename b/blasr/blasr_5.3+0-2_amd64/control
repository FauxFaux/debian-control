Description: mapping single-molecule sequencing reads
 Basic local alignment with successive refinement (BLASR) is a method
 for mapping single-molecule sequencing reads against a reference genome.
 Such reads are thousands of bases long, with divergence between them
 and the genome being dominated by insertion and deletion error.
