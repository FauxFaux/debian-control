Description: Development files for BLCR
 BLCR (Berkeley Lab Checkpoint/Restart) allows programs running on
 Linux to be "checkpointed" (written entirely to a file), and then
 later "restarted".
 .
 BLCR can checkpoint both single- and multithreaded (pthreads)
 programs linked with the NPTL implementation of pthreads. BLCR is
 also able to save and restore groups of related processes together
 with the pipes that connect them.
 .
 BLCR can checkpoint and restore (most) un-modified programs,
 however BLCR aware applications can customise this process
 further.
 .
 This package contains headers and files needed to compile
 applications that work with BLCR.
