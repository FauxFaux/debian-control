Description: Debian Pure Blends tasks for new installations
 This package installs a choice of a default installation for each
 Debian Pure Blend when run from the Debian installer. The
 installation includes the tasks package of the blend, so a subsequent
 invocation of tasksel enables the choice of individual tasks.
 .
 The package is intended to be installed in the base system. Later
 (un)installation is harmless, but has no effect.
