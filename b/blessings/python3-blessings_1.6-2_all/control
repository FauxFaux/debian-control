Description: simple but powerful module to manage terminal color and styling (Python 3)
 Blessings is a pythonic API to manipulate terminal. It provides similar
 features to curses but beating some of their limitations: it does not require
 clearing the whole screen for little changes, scrollback buffer after program
 exits, avoid styling when on output redirection, etc.
 .
 This package contains the module for Python 3.
