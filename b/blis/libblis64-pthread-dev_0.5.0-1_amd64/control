Description: BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software Framework
 BLIS is a portable software framework for instantiating high-performance
 BLAS-like dense linear algebra libraries. The framework was designed to
 isolate essential kernels of computation that, when optimized, immediately
 enable optimized implementations of most of its commonly used and
 computationally intensive operations. BLIS is written in ISO C99 and available
 under a new/modified/3-clause BSD license. While BLIS exports a new BLAS-like
 API, it also includes a BLAS compatibility layer which gives application
 developers access to BLIS implementations via traditional BLAS routine calls.
 An object-based API is also available for more experienced users.
 .
 The package contains the pthread version of development files.
