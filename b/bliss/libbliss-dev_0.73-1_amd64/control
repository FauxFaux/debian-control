Description: development files to compute graph automorphisms and labelings -- libdev
 Bliss is a backtracking algorithm for computing automorphism groups
 and canonical forms of graphs, based on individualization and
 refinement. Its data structures, subroutines, and pruning heuristics
 are specially designed for fast handling of large and sparse graphs.
 .
 This package provides the static library and symbolic links needed
 for development.
