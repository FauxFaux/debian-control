Description: library to compute graph automorphisms and labelings
 Bliss is a backtracking algorithm for computing automorphism groups
 and canonical forms of graphs, based on individualization and
 refinement. Its data structures, subroutines, and pruning heuristics
 are specially designed for fast handling of large and sparse graphs.
 .
 This package provides the shared library.
