Description: Xen API blktap shared library (development files)
 The Xen Cloud Platform (XCP) is an open source enterprise-ready server
 virtualization and cloud computing platform, delivering the Xen Hypervisor
 with support for a range of guest operating systems. This package is part
 of it. It implements the userland part of the blktap driver.
 .
 Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) is a file format standard which maps logical hard disk
 contents to a physical disk image format, which can then be more efficiently
 stored in a variety of different storage types, such as file systems or
 logical volumes.
 .
 VHDs are container files storing block metadata alongside a virtual disk's
 contents, in a single disk image. The metadata enables advanced storage
 backend capabilities, such as thin provisioning, disk image snapshotting, and
 coalescing of differencing disks.
 .
 Libvhd is a library to access VHD format metadata. It provides disk image
 initialization, inspection and manipulation to both VHD user utilities and
 the VHD disk driver in Blktap.
