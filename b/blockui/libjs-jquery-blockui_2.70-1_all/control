Description: simulate synchronous behaviour using AJAX
 The jQuery BlockUI Plugin simulates synchronous behavior when using AJAX,
 without locking the browser. When activated, it will prevent user activity
 with the page (or part of the page) until it is deactivated. BlockUI adds
 elements to the DOM to give it both the appearance and behavior of
 blocking user interaction.
