Description: static website compiler and blog engine
 Blogofile is a static website compiler, primarily (though not
 exclusively) designed to be a simple blogging engine. It requires no
 database and no special hosting environment. You customize a set of
 templates with Mako, create posts in a markup language of your choice
 (Markdown, Textile, reStructuredText or plain old HTML) and Blogofile
 renders your entire website as static HTML and Atom/RSS feeds which
 you can then upload to any old web server you like.
