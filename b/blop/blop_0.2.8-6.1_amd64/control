Description: Bandlimited wavetable-based oscillator plugins for LADSPA hosts
 BLOP comprises a set of LADSPA plugins that generate bandlimited
 sawtooth, square, variable pulse and slope-variable triangle waves,
 for use in LADSPA aware audio applications, principally as components
 of a modular synthesis network.
 .
 They are wavetable based, and are designed to produce output with
 harmonic content as high as possible over a wide pitch range.
 .
 Additionally, there are a few extra plugins to assist in building
 synthesis networks, like a analogue-type sequencer, sync-square and
 ADSR envelope.
