Description: light, feature-packed weblog app with plugin extensibility
 Blosxom (pronounced "Blossom") is a lightweight yet feature-packed
 weblog application designed from the ground up with simplicity,
 usability, and interoperability in mind.
 .
 Fundamental is its reliance upon the file system, folders and files as
 its content database. Blosxom's weblog entries are plain text files
 like any other. Write from the comfort of your favorite text editor
 and hit the Save button. Create, edit, rename, and delete entries on
 the command-line, via FTP, WebDAV, or anything else you might use to
 manipulate your files. There's no import or export; entries are
 nothing more complex than title on the first line, body being
 everything thereafter.
 .
 Despite its tiny footprint, Blosxom doesn't skimp on features,
 sporting the majority of features one would find in any other Weblog
 application.  Additionally, Blosxom 2 includes support for plugins, and
 thus much more extensive customization.
 .
 Blosxom is simple, straightforward, minimalist Perl affording even the
 dabbler an opportunity for experimentation and customization. And
 last, but not least, Blosxom is open source and free for the taking
 and altering.
