Description: blue GTK+ theme from the Shimmer Project
 Bluebird was the default theme for Xubuntu 10.10 but since 2011, Greybird
 has been Xubuntu's default theme. As its name indicates, Bluebird is a
 blue theme. The Shimmer Project are the designers and developers of both
 Bluebird and Greybird.
 .
 Bluebird works best in Xfce since it currently has incomplete support
 for newer versions of GTK+ 3.
