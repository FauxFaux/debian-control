Description: visual bookmarks for GNU Emacs
 Bm.el enables visible buffer local bookmarks in GNU Emacs.
 .
 Features:
   - Navigate between bookmarks specific to the current buffer or cycle
     through all buffers. When cycling through bookmarks in all open
     buffers, the search will always wrap around.
   - Configurable wrapping modes when end of bookmark set is reached.
   - Setting bookmarks based on a regexp, or on a line number.
   - Goto the point of a bookmark or the beginning its line.
   - Persistent bookmarks: They are non-persistent by default, but can
     be automatically persisted on either a global or per-buffer basis.
   - Annotated bookmarks: The annotation is displayed in the message
     area when navigating to a bookmark.
   - List bookmarks with annotations and context in a separate buffer.
   - Different bookmark styles: fringe-only, line-only, or both.
   - Experimental support for creating or removing a standard Emacs
     filename-based bookmark every time one toggles a bm.el one.
