Description: C++ template library for efficient platform independent bitsets
 BitMagic is a C++ template library designed and developed to implement
 efficient platform independent bitsets.  Key features:
 .
  - Several types of on the fly adaptive compression.
  - Dynamic range of addressable space of 232-1 bits.
  - Efficient memory management.
  - Cache optimized bitset distance algorithms.
  - Serialization in platform independent, compact format suitable
    for storing in files and databases.
  - Performance tuning for 32-bit and 64-bit systems.
  - Optimization for Intel SSE2 128-bit integer SIMD.
