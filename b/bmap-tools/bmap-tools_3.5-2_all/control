Description: tool to flash image files to block devices using the block map
 bmaptool is a generic tool for creating the block map (bmap) for a
 file, and copying files using the block map. The idea is that large
 file containing unused blocks, like raw system image files, can be
 copied or flashed a lot faster with bmaptool than with traditional
 tools like "dd" or "cp".
