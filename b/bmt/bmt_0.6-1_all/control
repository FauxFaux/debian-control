Description: software analysis benchmarking toolkit
 The benchmarking toolkit consists of three main components:
 .
  - Patch set management tools to track changes over the original source of a
    set of benchmarks;
  - Benchmark execution helpers to prepare benchmarks for various tools, run
    benchmarks in parallel, and limit execution;
  - Result evaluation and presentation, generating LaTeX tables, HTML output,
    and LaTeX/TikZ plots.
