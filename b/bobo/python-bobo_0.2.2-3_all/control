Description: Web application framework for the impatient
 Bobo is a light-weight framework for creating WSGI web applications. It's goal
 is to be easy to use and remember.

 It addresses 2 problems: Mapping URLs to objects, calling objects to
 generate HTTP responses.

 number of other features that are better provided by WSGI middle-ware or
 application-specific libraries.

 Bobo builds on other frameworks, most notably WSGI and WebOb.
