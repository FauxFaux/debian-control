Description: core client for the BOINC distributed computing infrastructure
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 This package contains the BOINC core client program that is required
 to participate in any project that uses BOINC. A central server
 distributes work units and collects results via this client. When
 attaching a local machine to a project, this client will also
 dynamically download the scientific data and executables to be then
 wrapped by the BOINC core client.
