Description: screen saver auto-controlling volunteer computing
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 The BOINC client is configurable by the command line or the BOINC
 manager's GUI to compute with any range between 0% and 100% of
 available resources, and to change that ratio to a higher after
 some user determined duration of inactivity. There is now quite
 a number of individuals who prefer to have everything presented
 with their accustomed principle for setting and choosing a screen
 saver. Upon inactivity, the BOINC client is started, and stopped
 again when the user is back. To save the screen, it then shows
 the graphical progress indication as optionally shown also by
 the manager.
 .
 This package is excellent to further promote BOINC, recalling the
 effect SETI@Home once had in the Cambridge, UK, CB2 Cybercafe.
 Just, when using it together with the regular BOINC client setup,
 it is suggested not to have all CPUs used to avoid multiple
 processes running on the same core.
