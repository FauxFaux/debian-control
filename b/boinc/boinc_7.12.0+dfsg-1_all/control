Description: metapackage for the BOINC client and the manager
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
 various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
 desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
 Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
 projects.
 .
 This package depends both on the BOINC core client program that is
 required to participate in any project that uses BOINC, and the
 BOINC Manager, a graphical monitor and control utility for the
 BOINC core client.
