Description: libraries of BOINC the client depends on
 The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
 software platform for distributed computing using volunteered computer
 resources.
 .
 The environment offers a series of libraries that both the user-run
 client and the client-invoked scientific applications depend on. With
 the number of cores per machine growing, and with scientific apps
 commonly started for every core, it is essential to have memory
 shared as much as possible between binaries of all projects.
