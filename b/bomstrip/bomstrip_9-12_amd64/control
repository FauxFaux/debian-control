Description: tool to strip Byte-Order Marks from UTF-8 text files
 Bomstrip is a very simple tool that removes BOM's (byte-order-marks)
 from UTF-8 files.  UTF-8 does not have byte-ordering issues, so there
 is absolutely no need to have three bytes (the UTF-8-BOM) that do not
 say anything about the byte-order (since there is nothing to say).
