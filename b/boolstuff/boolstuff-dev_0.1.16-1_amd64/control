Description: library for operating on boolean expression binary trees - devel
 BoolStuff is a C++ library that supports a few operations on boolean
 expression binary trees. The main features are:
  * a simple boolean expression parser (supports operators AND, OR and
    NOT, as well as parentheses)
  * an algorithm to convert a boolean expression binary tree into its
    Disjunctive Normal Form (this algorithm supports the NOT operator)
  * a function that determines if an expression tree is in DNF.
 .
 This package includes the development files for using the library from
 inside your programs.
