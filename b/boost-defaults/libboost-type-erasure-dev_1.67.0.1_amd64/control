Description: C++ runtime polymorphism based on concepts (default version)
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 C++ has two distinct kinds of polymorphism, virtual functions and templates,
 each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages.  The Boost.TypeErasure
 library combines the superior abstraction capabilities of templates, with the
 runtime flexibility of virtual functions.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
 Boost version (currently 1.67).
