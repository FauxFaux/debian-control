Description: C99/C++ preprocessor library (default version)
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.

 The Wave C++ preprocessor library is a Standards conformant
 implementation of the mandated C99/C++ preprocessor functionality
 packed behind a simple to use interface, which integrates well with
 the well known idioms of the Standard Template Library (STL).
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default
 Boost version (currently 1.62).
