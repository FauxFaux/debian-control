Description: generic graph components and algorithms in C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Parallel Boost Graph Library is an extension to the Boost Graph Library
 (BGL) for parallel and distributed computing. It offers distributed graphs
 and graph algorithms to exploit coarse-grained parallelism along with
 parallel algorithms that exploit fine-grained parallelism, while retaining
 the same interfaces as the (sequential) BGL. Code written using the sequential
 BGL should be easy to parallelize with the parallel BGL.
