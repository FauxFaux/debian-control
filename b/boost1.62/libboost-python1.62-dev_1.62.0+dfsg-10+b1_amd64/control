Description: Boost.Python Library development files
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost Python Library is used to quickly and easily export a C++
 library to Python such that the Python interface is very similar to
 the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally intrusive on your
 C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter your C++
 classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python.  The
 system should simply "reflect" your C++ classes and functions into
 Python. The major features of Boost.Python include support for:
 Subclassing extension types in Python, Overriding virtual functions
 in Python, Member function Overloading, Automatic wrapping of
 numeric operators among others.
 .
 This package also contains the pyste Boost.Python code generator that
 allows the user to specify classes and functions to be exported using
 a simple interface file, which following the Boost.Python's
 philosophy, is simple Python code.
 .
 This package allows development of a Python interface for all current
 versions of Python in Debian.  Code using this library will need also
 one of the Python development packages.
