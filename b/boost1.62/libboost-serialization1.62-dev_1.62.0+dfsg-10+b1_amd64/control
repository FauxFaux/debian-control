Description: serialization library for C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection,
 containing the following functionalities:
 .
  * proper restoration of pointers to shared data
  * serialization of STL containers and other commonly used templates
  * data portability - streams of bytes created on one platform should
    be readable on any other
  * archive interface must be rich enough to permit the creation of an
    archive that presents serialized data as XML in a useful manner
 .
 Here, "serialization" means the reversible deconstruction of an
 arbitrary set of C++ data structures to a sequence of bytes.
 archive: to refer to a specific rendering of this stream of bytes.
