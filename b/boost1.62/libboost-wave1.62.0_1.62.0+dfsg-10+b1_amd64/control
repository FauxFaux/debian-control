Description: C99/C++ preprocessor library
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Wave C++ preprocessor library is a Standards conformant
 implementation of the mandated C99/C++ preprocessor functionality
 packed behind a simple to use interface, which integrates well with
 the well known idioms of the Standard Template Library (STL).
