Description: C++ wall clock and CPU process timers
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Portable C++ timer classes that answer the question "How long does my
 C++ code take to run?" with as little as one #include and one
 additional line of code.
 .
 Class cpu_timer measures wall clock time, user CPU process time, and
 system CPU process time. Class auto_cpu_timer is a refinement of
 cpu_timer that automatically reports the elapsed times when an
 auto_cpu_timer object is destroyed.
