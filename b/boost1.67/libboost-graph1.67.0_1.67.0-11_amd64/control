Description: generic graph components and algorithms in C++
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Graphs are mathematical abstractions that are useful for solving
 many types of problems in computer science. Consequently, these
 abstractions must also be represented in computer programs. A
 standardized generic interface for traversing graphs is of utmost
 importance to encourage reuse of graph algorithms and data structures.
