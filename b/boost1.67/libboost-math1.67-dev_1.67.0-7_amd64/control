Description: Boost.Math Library development files
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 This library is divided into three interconnected parts:
  * Statistical Distributions: Provides a reasonably comprehensive set of
    statistical distributions, upon which higher level statistical tests
    can be built.
  * Mathematical Special Functions: Provides a small number of high quality
    special functions, initially these were concentrated on functions used in
    statistical applications along with those in the Technical Report on
    C++ Library Extensions.
  * Implementation Toolkit: Provides many of the tools required to implement
    mathematical special functions.
