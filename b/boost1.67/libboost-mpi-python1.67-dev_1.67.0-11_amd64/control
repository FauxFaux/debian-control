Description: C++ interface to the Message Passing Interface (MPI), Python Bindings
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.MPI library provides a C++ interface to MPI that
 supports modern C++ development styles, including complete support for
 user-defined data types and C++ Standard Library types, arbitrary function
 objects for collective algorithms, and the use of modern C++ library
 techniques to maintain maximal efficiency.
 .
 This package provides Python Bindings to the C++ interface.
