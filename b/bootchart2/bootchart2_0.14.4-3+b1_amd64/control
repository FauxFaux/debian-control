Description: boot process performance analyser
 bootchart2 is a boot process performance analyser: a tool that lets you
 collect and analyse data from your boot process.
 bootchart2 origins from bootchart, and has some advantages over it:
 .
  - more detailed kernel charting: uses the taskstats interface, instead
    of /proc/*/stat
  - the data collector has been rewritten to make it faster
 .
 After the boot, you can view the logged data with a separately-provided
 GUI.
