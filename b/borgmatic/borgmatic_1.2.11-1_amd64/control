Description: automatically create, prune and verify backups with borgbackup
 borgmatic is a simple Python wrapper script for the Borg backup software that
 initiates a backup, prunes any old backups according to a retention policy,
 and validates backups for consistency. The script supports specifying your
 settings in a declarative configuration file rather than having to put them
 all on the command-line, and handles common errors.
