Description: browse output of processes
 bosh stands for browsable output shell. This is a bit of a
 misnomer because it isn't really a shell. What is does is
 store the output of a specified program in a buffer, and
 provides a simple curses interface to browse this buffer.
 Actions can be configured which can make use of the
 contents of the currently selected line.
 .
 Commands and actions are stored in bosh configuration files.
 These can include shebang line (#!/usr/bin/bosh) so that the
 configuration can just be run from the command-line.
