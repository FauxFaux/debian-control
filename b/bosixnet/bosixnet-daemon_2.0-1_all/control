Description: Build Own IPv6 Network (client utilities)
 Project should be useful when you have to administer many computers
 distributed through different networks and connected via NAT. In most of
 cases you may just install miredo, gogoc or any other tunnel broker's
 software and these computers will be available via IPv6 addresses. BOSixNet
 includes the collection of tools for automatic updating the list of such
 hosts.
 .
 This package provides the shell script which periodically sends information
 about current IPv6 address to remote server and updates local /etc/hosts
 based on data received from that remote server. It is expected that
 bosixnet-webui is launched on that remote server.
