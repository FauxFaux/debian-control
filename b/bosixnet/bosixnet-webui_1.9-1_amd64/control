Description: Build Own IPv6 Network (server utilities)
 Project should be useful when you have to administer many computers
 distributed through different networks and connected via NAT. In most of
 cases you may just install miredo, gogoc or any other tunnel broker's
 software and these computers will be available via IPv6 addresses. BOSixNet
 includes the collection of tools for automatic updating the list of such
 hosts.
 .
 This package provides the FastCGI program which passively listens for
 incoming connections and generates list of hosts in your IPv6 network which
 may be put directly into /etc/hosts. Program has very few dependencies and
 it may be easily launched on embedded devices.
