Description: eat the yummy veggies in the garden - game for small kids
 You play Bouncy the Hungry Rabbit. You're in a garden with yummy veggies and
 a farmer who's not keen on you eating them. You can hide (and move around)
 under the ground.
 .
 Bouncy was written so it could be enjoyed by the author's daughter, who was
 about to turn 3, and by older gamers. Hence it's not a violent game and "easy"
 is really, really easy, and "hard" is challenging.
