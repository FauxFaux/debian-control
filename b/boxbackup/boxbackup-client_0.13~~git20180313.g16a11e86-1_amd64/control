Description: client for the BoxBackup remote backup system
 BoxBackup is an automatic on-line backup system.
 The client watches for changes on the local file system,
 connects to a BoxBackup server and sends the changes via a
 secure channel. All data is encrypted before being sent to
 the server. A command-line tool is provided for restoration
 of backups including deleted files and old versions.
