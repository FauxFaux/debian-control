Description: Pretty-printing of multiple sequence alignments
 Boxshade is a program for creating good looking printouts from
 multiple-aligned protein or DNA sequences. The program does not perform
 the alignment by itself and requires as input a file that was created
 by a multiple alignment program or manually edited with respective tools.
 .
 Boxshade reads multiple-aligned sequences from either PILEUP-MSF,
 CLUSTAL-ALN, MALIGNED-data and ESEE-save files (limited to a maximum
 of 150 sequences with up to 10000 elements each).  Various kinds of
 shading can be applied to identical/similar residues. Output is written
 to screen or to a file in the following formats: ANSI/VT100, PS/EPS,
 RTF, HPGL, ReGIS, LJ250-printer, ASCII, xFIG, PICT, HTML
