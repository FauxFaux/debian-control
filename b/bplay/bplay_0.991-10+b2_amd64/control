Description: Buffered audio file player/recorder
 The bplay package provides a simple command-line utility for playing
 and recording audio files in raw sample, VOC and WAV formats.
 .
 To use this program you need a soundcard of some kind and the
 appropriate driver configured into your kernel.
 .
 When run the program creates two processes which share a memory
 buffer.  It does reading/writing on the disk and the sound device
 simultaneously, in order to be less liable to `pause' because the
 disk is too slow or too busy.
