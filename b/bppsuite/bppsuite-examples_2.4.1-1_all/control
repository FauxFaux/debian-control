Description: Examples for Bio++ program suite
 The Bio++ Program Suite is a package of programs using the Bio++
 libraries and dedicated to Phylogenetics and Molecular Evolution.  All
 programs are independent, but can be combined to perform rather complex
 analyses.  These programs use the interface helper tools of the
 libraries, and hence share the same syntax.  They also have several
 options in common, which may also be shared by third-party software.
 .
 This package contains some example data sets.
