Description: fancy interface to the Python 3 interpreter
 bpython is a fancy interface to the Python interpreter, and has the
 following features:
 .
   * In-line syntax highlighting.
   * Readline-like autocomplete with suggestions displayed as you type
   * Expected parameter list for any Python function. Uses pydoc to attempt to
     divine params for C functions.
   * "Rewind" function to pop the last line of code from memory and re-evaluate.
     Note: this is only really useful when laying out classes and functions,
     since a true "undo" function is impossible, so be careful when using this.
   * Send the code you've entered off to a pastebin and display the pastebin URL
     for copying, etc.
   * Save the code you've entered to a file.
   * Auto-indentation.
   * Anti-Crash Mode.
 .
 This package contains bpython for Python 3.
