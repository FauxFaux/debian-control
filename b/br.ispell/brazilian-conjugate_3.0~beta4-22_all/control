Description: Brazilian Portuguese verb conjugator
 This package contains a interactive program (conjugue) capable of
 conjugating Portuguese verbs, as spoken in Brazil.  The upstream version
 is numbered 1.0, but as it is distributed together with the Ispell
 dictionary for Brazilian Portuguese, it has the same version number as the
 ibrazilian package for Debian.
