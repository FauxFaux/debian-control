Description: BLAST Ring Image Generator
 BRIG can display circular comparisons between a large number of genomes,
 with a focus on handling genome assembly data.
  * Images show similarity between a central reference sequence and other
    sequences as concentric rings.
  * BRIG will perform all BLAST comparisons and file parsing automatically
    via a simple GUI.
  * Contig boundaries and read coverage can be displayed for draft genomes;
    customized graphs and annotations can be displayed.
  * Using a user-defined set of genes as input, BRIG can display gene
    presence, absence, truncation or sequence variation in a set of
    complete genomes, draft genomes or even raw, unassembled sequence data.
  * BRIG also accepts SAM-formatted read-mapping files enabling genomic
    regions present in unassembled sequence data from multiple samples to
    be compared simultaneously
