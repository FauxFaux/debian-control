Description: daemon which regulates brightness of LCDs dynamically
 The idea is taken from the way Macs behave: If a user is inactive for
 a certain time, it automatically darkens the screen.
 It is designed for IBM/Lenovo Thinkpads, but works with every display
 which is controllable via /sys/class/backlight/.
