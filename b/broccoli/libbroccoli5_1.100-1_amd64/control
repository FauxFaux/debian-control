Description: Bro client communications library
 Broccoli is the "Bro client communications library". It allows you to
 create client sensors for the Bro intrusion detection system.
 Broccoli can speak a good subset of the Bro communication protocol,
 in particular, it can receive Bro IDs, send and receive Bro events,
 and send and receive event requests to/from peering Bros. You can
 currently create and receive values of pure types like integers,
 counters, timestamps, IP addresses, port numbers, booleans, and
 strings.
