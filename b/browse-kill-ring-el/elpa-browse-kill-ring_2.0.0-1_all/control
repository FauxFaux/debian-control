Description: interactively insert items from kill-ring
 Ever feel that 'C-y M-y M-y M-y ...' is not a great way of trying to
 find that piece of text you know you killed a while back? Then
 browse-kill-ring.el is for you.
 .
 Note that the command keeps track of the last window displayed to
 handle insertion of chosen text; this might have unexpected
 consequences if you do 'M-x browse-kill-ring', then switch your
 window configuration, and try to use the same *Kill Ring* buffer
 again.
