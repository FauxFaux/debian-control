Description: software convolution engine
 BruteFIR is a program for applying long FIR filters to multi-channel
 digital audio, either offline or in realtime. Its basic operation is
 specified through a configuration file, and filters, attenuation and
 delay can be changed in runtime through a simple command line
 interface. The FIR filter algorithm used is  an optimised frequency
 domain algorithm, partly implemented in hand-coded assembler, thus
 throughput is extremely high. In realtime, a standard computer can
 typically run more than 10 channels with more than 60000 filter taps
 each.
 .
 Through its highly modular design, things like adaptive filtering,
 signal generators and sample I/O are easily added, extended and
 modified, without the need to alter the program itself.
