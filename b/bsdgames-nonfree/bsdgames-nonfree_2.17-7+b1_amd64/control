Description: rogue, the classic dungeon exploration game
 This is a text-based game common on (traditional) BSD systems.  It may
 not be distributed freely, so it had to be broken off from the main
 bsdgames package and placed in non-free.
 .
 This package now contains only rogue, the classic dungeon exploration game.
