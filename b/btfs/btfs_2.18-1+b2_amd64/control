Description: access torrent files as a filesystem
 btfs allows you to mount .torrent or magnet links
 as local directories using fuse.
 .
 Tools like cp, cat and ls would work the same as
 on a normal filesystem. You can also play videos
 using normal video software and only the  sections
 that you stream will be transferred.
