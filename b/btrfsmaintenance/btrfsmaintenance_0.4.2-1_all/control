Description: automate btrfs maintenance tasks on mountpoints or directories
 This is a set of scripts for the btrfs filesystem that automates the
 following maintenance tasks: scrub, balance, trim, and defragment.
 .
 Tasks are enabled, disabled, scheduled, and customised from a single
 text file.  The default configuration assumes an installation profile
 where / is a btrfs filesystem.
 .
 The default values have been chosen as an even compromise between
 time to complete maintenance, improvement in filesystem performance,
 and minimum impact on other processes.  Please note that I/O priority
 scheduling requires the use of CFQ, and not noop, deadline,
 anticipatory, or blk-mq.  CFQ is Debian's default block scheduler.
