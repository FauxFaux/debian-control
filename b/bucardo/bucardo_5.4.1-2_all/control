Description: asynchronous replication system for PostgreSQL
 Bucardo is an asynchronous PostgreSQL replication system, allowing for both
 multi-master and multi-slave operations.
 .
 Bucardo uses PL/pgSQL and Pl/PerlU triggers to send notification events to a
 daemon, which replicates the data modifications, and Bucardo provides both
 standard and custom conflict resolution methods.
