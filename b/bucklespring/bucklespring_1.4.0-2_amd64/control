Description: Nostalgia bucklespring keyboard sound
 Buckle emulates the sound of an old IBM Model-M space saver
 bucklespring keyboard while typing within an X session.
 .
 It runs as a background process and plays back the sound of each key
 pressed and released on the keyboard, just as if using an IBM Model-M.
 The sound of each key has carefully been sampled, and is played back
 while simulating the proper distance and direction for a realistic 3D
 sound palette of pure nostalgic bliss.
