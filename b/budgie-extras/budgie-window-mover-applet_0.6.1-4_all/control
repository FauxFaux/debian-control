Description: Applet allows moving windows between workspaces for the Budgie Desktop
 This is part of a suite of python3 and Vala based applets for the Budgie
 Desktop that provide additional user orientated capabilities.
 The applets can be used individually or as a set.
 .
 The Window Mover applet allows the user to quickly move windows to any
 of the other workspaces. Just drag a window to the bottom of the screen
 and a bar will popup, representing the workspaces. Click on
 any of the numbers (or press the corresponding number on the keyboard)
 and the window will move to that workspace.
