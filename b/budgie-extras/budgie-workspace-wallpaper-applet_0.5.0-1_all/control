Description: Applet providing per workspace wallpaper
 This is part of a suite of python3 based applets for the Budgie
 Desktop that provide additional user orientated capabilities.
 The applets can be used individually or as a set.
 .
 The workspace wallpaper applet shows a different wallpaper on each of
 the workspaces. Usage is simple: add the applet to the panel and set
 wallpapers on each of the workspaces in the way you are used to.
 The applet will remember what wallpaper was set on each of the
 workspaces.
