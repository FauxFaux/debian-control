Description: Text mode alternative to Buffy
 buffycli displays a compact summary of your mail folders in text-mode, and
 allows you to invoke a command (usually a mail reader) on them. It is written
 with the intent of being a handy everyday tool for people handling large
 volumes of mail. For mutt users, this can be a nice front-end to supplement
 the simple built-in folder browser when one has many folders to keep track of.
 It tries hard to work out of the box: it looks for mail folders in sensible
 places and comes with reasonable defaults.
 .
 buffycli uses the same backend as Buffy, but it outputs text to the terminal,
 rather than a GUI window. It is thus suitable to be used over SSH links, and
 fits nicely with window managers that are primarily used to organise
 terminals.
 .
 Buffycli is functional but still very young, and only Maildir and Mailbox
 format are supported at the moment.
