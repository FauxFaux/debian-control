Description: distributed bug tracking system using VCS storage
 Bugs Everywhere is a “distributed bug tracker”, designed to
 complement a distributed version control system (VCS). By using a
 distributed VCS as a back-end for bug state, it gains several
 convenient features:
 .
  * Bugs and code that live on branches are tracked together.
  * Users can fully modify bug state while offline.
  * When a user checks out a project’s source code, she gets the current
    bug state for free.
  * A web interface to the bug database becomes just another client that
    merges with the main repository.
 .
 Bugs Everywhere currently supports the following VCS back-ends:
 .
  * GNU Arch (tla, baz)
  * Bazaar (bzr)
  * git
  * Mercurial (hg)
  * Darcs
  * Monotone (mtn)
  * GNU RCS
