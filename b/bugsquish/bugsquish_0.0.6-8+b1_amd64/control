Description: Bugs are trying to suck blood out of your arm!
 "Bug Squish" is an action game not unlike light gun arcade games, but
 played with a mouse.  It's loosely based on a MacOS game whose name I
 can't recall.
 .
 Bugs are trying to suck blood out of your arm!  Squish them with
 your fly swatter before you run out of blood.
