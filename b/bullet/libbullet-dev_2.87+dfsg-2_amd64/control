Description: professional 3D Game Multiphysics Library -- development files
 Bullet professional 3D Game Multiphysics Library provides state of the art
 collision detection, soft body and rigid body dynamics.
 .
  * Used by many movie and game companies in AAA titles on Playstation 3, XBox
    360, Nintendo Wii, PC, Android and iPhone.
  * Modular extendible C++ design with hot-swap of most components.
  * Discrete and continuous collision detection (CCD).
  * Swept collision queries.
  * Ray casting with custom collision filtering.
  * Generic convex support (using GJK), capsule, cylinder, cone, sphere, box and
    non-convex triangle meshes.
  * Support for dynamic deformation of non-convex triangle meshes, by refitting
    the acceleration structures.
 .
 Multiphysics support including:
 .
  * Rigid body dynamics including constraint solvers, generic constraints,
    ragdolls, hinge, ball-socket.
  * Support for constraint limits and motors.
  * Soft body support including cloth, rope and deformable.
  * Bullet is integrated into Blender.
  * Serialization of physics data in the cross-platform binary bullet file
    format.
 .
 This package contains development files for Bullet.
