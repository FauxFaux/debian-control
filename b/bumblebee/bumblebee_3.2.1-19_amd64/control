Description: NVIDIA Optimus support for Linux
 Bumblebee is an effort to make NVIDIA Optimus enabled laptops work in
 GNU/Linux systems. These laptops are built in such a way that the NVIDIA
 graphics card can be used on demand so that battery life is improved and
 temperature is kept low.
 .
 It disables the discrete graphics card if no client is detected, and starts
 an X server making use of NVIDIA card if requested then let software GL
 implementations (such as VirtualGL) copy frames to the visible display that
 runs on the integrated graphics. The ability to use discrete graphics
 depends on the driver: open source nouveau and proprietary nvidia.
