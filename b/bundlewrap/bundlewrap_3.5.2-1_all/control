Description: Decentralized configuration management system with Python
 By allowing for easy and low-overhead config management, BundleWrap fills
 the gap between complex deployments using Chef or Puppet and old school
 system administration over SSH.
 .
 While most other config management systems rely on a client-server
 architecture, BundleWrap works off a repository cloned to your local machine.
 .
 It then automates the process of SSHing into your servers and making sure
 everything is configured the way it's supposed to be. You won't have to
 install anything on managed servers.
