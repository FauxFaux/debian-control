Description: command-line tool for writing optical media
 ‘burn’ is a command-line tool to create audio discs from MP3, Ogg
 Vorbis, or WAV files, to backup data files, to create discs from
 ISO-9660 images, and to copy discs on-the-fly. It performs any of its
 functions in a single command, without requiring preparatory
 filesystem creation, etc.
 .
 The program can compute if there is necessary free space for
 temporary files (images and audio files), warn if size is bigger than
 disc capacity, and manage multisession discs.
