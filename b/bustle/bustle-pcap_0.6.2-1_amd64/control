Description: D-Bus traffic capture tool for the pcap format
 Bustle is a tool to chart and provide timing information of D-Bus
 calls for profiling and debugging purposes. It is intended to replace
 reading the cryptic output of dbus-monitor.
 .
 This package contains the capture tool which will capture the D-Bus
 traffic into a pcap file that can be visualized using Bustle.
