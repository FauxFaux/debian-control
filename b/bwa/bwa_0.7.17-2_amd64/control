Description: Burrows-Wheeler Aligner
 BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against
 a large reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of
 three algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first
 algorithm is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while
 the rest two for longer sequences ranged from 70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM
 and BWA-SW share similar features such as long-read support and split
 alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended
 for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM
 also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina
 reads.
