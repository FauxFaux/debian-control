Description: Bywater BASIC Interpreter
 The Bywater BASIC Interpreter (bwBASIC) implements a large superset
 of the ANSI Standard for Minimal BASIC (X3.60-1978) and a significant
 subset of the ANSI Standard for Full BASIC (X3.113-1987) in C.  It
 also offers shell programming facilities as an extension of BASIC.
 bwBASIC seeks to be as portable as possible.
