Description: bandwidth test controller (client)
 The Bwctl suite works with nuttcp and iperf to test bandwidth without
 the need for a shell account on the remote systems.
 .
 This package contains the command line tool for scheduling and controlling
 tests. It requires the bwctl-server package to be installed on the
 hosts at both ends of the network that you are trying to test.
