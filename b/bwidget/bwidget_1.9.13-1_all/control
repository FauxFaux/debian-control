Description: Extension widgets for Tcl/Tk
 The BWidget toolkit is a high-level widget set for Tcl/Tk. It contains
 widgets such as progress bars, 3D separators, various manager widgets
 for top levels, frames, paned or scrolled windows, button boxes,
 notebooks or dialogs as well as composite widgets such as combo boxes,
 spin boxes and tree widgets.
 .
 The BWidget toolkit is completely written in Tcl so no compiled
 extension library is required.
