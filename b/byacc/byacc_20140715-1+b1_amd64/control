Description: public domain Berkeley LALR Yacc parser generator
 This package provides a parser generator utility that reads a grammar
 specification from a file and generates an LR(1) parser for it.  The
 parsers consist of a set of LALR(1) parsing tables and a driver
 routine written in the C programming language.  It has a public domain
 license which includes the generated C.
