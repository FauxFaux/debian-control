 bzfs is the server for BZFlag, and it must be running to play. It can be run
 on any system on the network (including a player's system or one without
 graphics). You need to install this package if you wish to:
  - play by yourself
  - play amongst a small group of people on a private network
  - provide a server so that anyone on the Internet may play with you
