Description: GUI application for using Bazaar
 Bazaar Explorer is a desktop application providing an easy-to-use
 interface to the Bazaar version control system. It is designed to
 be simple enough for casual users of version control, yet powerful
 enough for experts to be productive.
 .
 It provides a high level interface to all commonly used features,
 launching "applets" from the QBzr plug-in to provide most of the
 functionality.
