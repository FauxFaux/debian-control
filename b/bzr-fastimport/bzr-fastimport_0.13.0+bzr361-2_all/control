Description: Fast-import/fast-export plugin for Bazaar
 Bazaar Fast Import is a plugin providing fast loading of revision control
 data into Bazaar.
 .
 It is designed to be used in combination with front-end programs that
 generate a command/data stream for it to process. Front-ends are available
 for a wide range of foreign VCS tools including Subversion, CVS, Git,
 Mercurial, Darcs and Perforce. New front-ends are easy to develop in whatever
 programming language you prefer, making Bazaar Fast Import useful for teams
 needing a custom migration solution.
