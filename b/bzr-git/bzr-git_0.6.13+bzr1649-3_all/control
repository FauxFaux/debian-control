Description: Bazaar plugin providing Git integration
 This is a plugin for Bazaar that adds the ability to use Git repositories,
 both local and remote (git://, git+ssh:// and http://). It integrates with the
 regular Bazaar UI, and provides a new Bazaar subcommand `git-import` which
 imports all branches from a Git repository.
 .
 An experimental remote helper for Git that can push to and
 fetch from Bazaar branches is also provided.
