Description: Bazaar plugin for managing a pipeline of changes
 A Bazaar plugin helps you organize your changes into sections called
 "pipes"
 .
 Pipelines can help you:
 .
  * focus on each set of changes as a coherent piece, without being distracted
    by other sets of changes.
  * respect diff size limits when submitting changes
  * avoid reviewer fatigue when submitting changes for code review
  * maintain a set of patches against an upstream branch
