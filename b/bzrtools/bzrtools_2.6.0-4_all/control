Description: Collection of tools for bzr
 This package contains a collection of plugins for bzr - a distributed

 for day to day operations.

  * rspush: Push local changes to a remote server using rsync instead
    sftp.

  * patch: Apply a specified patch to your tree, that can be a file
    or URL.
  * heads: Show all revisions in a repository not having descendants.
