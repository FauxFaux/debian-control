Description: Extensive tutorial and documentation about C++ - DVI output
 The C++ Annotations offer an extensive tutorial about the C++ programming
 language. It can be used as a textbook for C/C++ programming courses.
 .
 This document is intended for knowledgeable users of C (or any other language
 using a C-like grammar, like Perl or Java) who would like to know more about,
 or make the transition to, C++. This document is the main textbook for
 Frank's C++ programming courses, which are yearly organized at the University
 of Groningen, the Netherlands.
 .
 The C++ Annotations do not cover all aspects of C++, though. In particular,
 C++'s basic grammar, which is, for all practical purposes, equal to C's
 grammar, is not covered. For this part of the C++ language, the reader should
 consult other texts, like a book covering the C programming language.
 .
 The package offers the C++ Annotations in the DVI format.
