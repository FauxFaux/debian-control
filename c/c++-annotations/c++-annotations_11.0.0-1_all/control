Description: Extensive tutorial and documentation about C++
 The C++ Annotations offer an extensive tutorial about the C++ programming
 language. It can be used as a textbook for C/C++ programming courses.
 .
 This document is intended for knowledgeable users of C (or any other language
 using a C-like grammar, like Perl or Java) who would like to know more about,
 or make the transition to, C++. This document is the main textbook for
 Frank's C++ programming courses, which are yearly organized at the University
 of Groningen, the Netherlands.
 .
 The C++ Annotations do not cover all aspects of C++, though. In particular,
 C++'s basic grammar, which is, for all practical purposes, equal to C's
 grammar, is not covered. For this part of the C++ language, the reader should
 consult other texts, like a book covering the C programming language.
 .
 This package installs C++ Annotations packages for all available formats,
 including:
    - plain ascii text
    - LaTeX (including a .dvi file)
    - PostScript
    - pdf
    - html
 The postscript, pdf and LaTeX formats were constructed for two different
 paper-sizes: A4 and legal.
 .
 If you do not require all of the available formats, you may prefer to
 install one or more of the following c++-annotations-{format} packages
 instead:
    - c++-annotations-html
    - c++-annotations-txt
    - c++-annotations-latex
    - c++-annotations-pdf
    - c++-annotations-ps
    - c++-annotations-dvi
