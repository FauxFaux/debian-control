Description: Multi-Threading poller for cacti
 Spine is a replacement for the default cmd.php poller in the cacti
 package. It primarily strives to be as fast as possible, and is
 designed for sites with large numbers of hosts and devices polled.
 .
 If the default poller provided by cacti works for you, then you should
 not use this package.  You should only use this package if the default
 poller is unable to complete a polling cycle in the required amount
 of time.
