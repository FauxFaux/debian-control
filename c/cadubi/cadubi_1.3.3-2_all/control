Description: Creative ASCII Drawing Utility By Ian
 CADUBI is an application written in Perl that allows you to draw
 text-based images that are viewable on typical unix-based consoles.
 Usually the applications that emulate these consoles support various
 text modes, such as background and foreground colors, bold, and inverse.
 .
 This text art, commonly called "ASCII art", is used in various places
 such as online BBSes, email and login prompts.
