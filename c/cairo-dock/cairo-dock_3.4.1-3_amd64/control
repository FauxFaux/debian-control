Description: Metapackage for cairo-dock
 Cairo-dock has a family-likeness with OS X dock, but with more options.
 It uses cairo to render nice graphics, and Glitz to use hardware acceleration.
 It's fully configurable and can be a taskbar too.
 You can easily plug applets into it.
 .
 This is metapackage that provides the components necessary for running
 Cairo-dock. This installs a cairo-dock-core application and cairo-dock-plugins
 package easily.
 .
 And Cairo-dock installs cairo-dock-core and plugins and makes sense as
 Cairo-dock.
