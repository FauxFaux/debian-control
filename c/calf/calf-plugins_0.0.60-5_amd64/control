Description: Calf Studiogear - audio effects and sound generators
 The Calf plugins include all todays frequently used studio effects
 along with some feature-rich sound processors.
 .
 Calf Studiogear is designed to run under the most flexible plugin
 standard in Linux, namely LV2. So you're able to insert them in lots of
 plugin-capable audio software like Ardour, Rosegarden and others.
 .
 The Calf Rack offers you all Calf effects and synthesizers in an
 easy-to-use studio rack. Wire the effects through Jack to build your own
 studio environment and trigger the sound processors live or through a
 MIDI sequencer or tracker.
 .
 Calf Rack supports LADISH level 1.
