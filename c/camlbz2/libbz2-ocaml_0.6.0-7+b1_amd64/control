Description: OCaml bindings for the bzip2 compression library
 CamlBZ2 provides OCaml bindings for libbz2 (AKA bzip2), a popular
 compression library which typically compresses better (i.e., smaller
 resulting files) than gzip.
 .
 Using CamlBZ2 you can read and write compressed "files", where files
 can be anything offering an in_channel/out_channel abstraction
 (files, sockets, ...).
 .
 Also, with CamlBZ2 you can compress and decompress strings in memory
 using the bzip2 compression algorithm.
 .
 This package contains only the shared runtime stub libraries.
