Description: Stub code generator for Objective Caml
 CamlIDL generates stub code for interfacing Caml with C from an IDL
 description of the C functions.  Thus, CamlIDL automates the most
 tedious task in interfacing C libraries with Caml programs.
 .
 It can also be used to interface Caml programs with other languages, as
 long as those languages have a well-defined C interface.
 .
 This package contains the CamlIDL executable.
