Description: interface between OCaml and Java via Caml/C interface and JNI
 CamlJava is an interface between OCaml and Java allowing programs written in
 one of the two languages to call code written in the other.
 .
 Interaction among the two languages happen via the respective C interfaces:
 Caml/C interface for OCaml and JNI (Java Native Interface) for Java.
 .
 Currently, CamlJava provides a low-level, weakly-typed OCaml interface very
 similar to the JNI. Java object references are mapped to an abstract type, and
 various JNI-like operations are provided to allow Java method invocation,
 field access, and more.
 .
 A basic callback facility (allowing Java code to invoke methods on OCaml
 objects) is also provided, although some stub Java code must be written by
 hand.
 .
 This package contain all the development stuff needed to use CamlJava from
 OCaml programs.
