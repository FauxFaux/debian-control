Description: small Ruby web framework for Model-View-Controller type applications
 Camping is a web framework which consistently stays at less than 4kb of
 code. The idea here is to store a complete fledgling web application
 (written in Ruby) in a single file like many small CGIs, but to organize
 it as a Model-View-Controller application like Rails does. You can then
 easily move it to Rails once you've got it going.
