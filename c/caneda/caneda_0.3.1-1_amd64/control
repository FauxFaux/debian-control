Description: Electronic Design Automation software focused on easy of use and portability
 Caneda is an open source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) application
 focused on easy of use and portability. It's goal is to handle the complete
 design process from schematic capture, through simulation and into circuit
 layout and PCB.
 .
 The software aims to support all kinds of circuit simulation types, e.g. DC,
 AC, S-parameter and harmonic balance analysis.
