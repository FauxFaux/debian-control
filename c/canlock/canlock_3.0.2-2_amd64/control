Description: utility for creating and verifying Usenet cancel locks
 Cancel locks are used by Usenet article posters to authenticate their
 authorship of an article. It may then by used by servers to prevent
 cancel and supersede abuse. The use of this feature remains the
 newsmaster's decision.
 .
 This simple utility wraps the canlock library, and may be used for both
 the generation and the verification of cancel locks.
