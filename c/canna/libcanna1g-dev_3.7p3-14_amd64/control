Description: input system for Japanese - development files
 Canna provides a unified user interface for Japanese input. It is based
 on a client-server model and supports automatic kana-to-kanji conversion.
 .
 It supports multiple clients (including kinput2 and canuum), and allows
 them all to work in the same way, sharing customization files,
 romaji-to-kana conversion rules and conversion dictionaries.
 .
 This package provides the headers and static libraries needed to develop
 software based on Canna.
