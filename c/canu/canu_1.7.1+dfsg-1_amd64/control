Description: single molecule sequence assembler for genomes
 Canu is a fork of the Celera Assembler, designed for high-noise
 single-molecule sequencing (such as the PacBio RS II or Oxford
 Nanopore MinION).
 .
 Canu is a hierarchical assembly pipeline which runs in four steps:
 .
  * Detect overlaps in high-noise sequences using MHAP
  * Generate corrected sequence consensus
  * Trim corrected sequences
  * Assemble trimmed corrected sequences
