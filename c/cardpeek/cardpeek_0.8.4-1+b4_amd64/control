Description: Tool to read the contents of ISO7816 smartcards
 The goal of cardpeek is to allow smartcard owners to be better informed
 about what type of personal information is stored in these devices.
 The tool currently reads the contents of :
 .
  * EMV cards, including NFC ones
  * Navigo public transport cards (partially supports MOBIB as well)
  * The French health card "Vitale 2"
  * Electronic/Biometric passports in BAC security mode
 .
 It can also read the following cards with limited interpretation of data:
  * Some Mifare cards (such as the Thalys card)
  * Moneo, the French electronic purse
  * GSM SIM cards
