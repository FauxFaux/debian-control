Description: Randomized testing infrastructure for JUnit, Ant and Maven
 Inspired by the Apache Lucene project's infrastructure, this project brings
 a refactored, stand-alone runner for JUnit 4.x tests, which encapsulates
 built-in repeatable randomized tests, threading and timeout control, parameter
 factories, thread execution groups and more. Everything is JUnit compatible
 and works in any IDE.
 .
 On top of that, the project comes with Ant and Maven integration allowing
 execution of tests in concurrent isolated JVMs, load-balancing and multiple
 options for reporting, including attractive reports and results visualizations.
