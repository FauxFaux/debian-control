Description: CASA derived mscal library
 The casacore package contains the core libraries of the old
 AIPS++/CASA (Common Astronomy Software Applications) package. This
 split was made to get a better separation of core libraries and
 applications.
 .
 This package contains derived MeasurementSet quantities (like hourangle) that
 can be used as virtual table columns or as TaQL user defined functions.
