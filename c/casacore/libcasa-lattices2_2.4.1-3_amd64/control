Description: CASA lattice library
 The casacore package contains the core libraries of the old
 AIPS++/CASA (Common Astronomy Software Applications) package. This
 split was made to get a better separation of core libraries and
 applications.
 .
 This package implements memory- or disk-based N-dimensional arrays (lattices)
 with masking, regions, expressions, and math.
