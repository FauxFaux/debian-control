Description: CASA functions handling measures
 The casacore package contains the core libraries of the old
 AIPS++/CASA (Common Astronomy Software Applications) package. This
 split was made to get a better separation of core libraries and
 applications.
 .
 This module extends TaQL (the Table Query Language) with functions handling
 measures. Currently it can handle directions, epochs, and positions.
