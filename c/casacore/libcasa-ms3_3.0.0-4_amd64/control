Description: CASA MeasurementSet library
 The casacore package contains the core libraries of the old
 AIPS++/CASA (Common Astronomy Software Applications) package. This
 split was made to get a better separation of core libraries and
 applications.
 .
 This package contains the data format for visibility data as described in the
 MeasurementSet definition. The MeasurementSet is where all data are
 ultimately to be found in CASA.
