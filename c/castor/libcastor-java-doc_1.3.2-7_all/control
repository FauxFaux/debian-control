Description: Documentation for Castor Java databinding framework
 Documentation for Castor, that is a data binding framework for Java. It's
 the shortest path between Java objects, XML documents and relational tables.
 .
 Castor XML is an XML data binding framework. Unlike the two main XML APIs,
 DOM (Document Object Model) and SAX (Simple API for XML) which deal with
 the structure of an XML document, Castor enables you to deal with the
 data defined in an XML document through an object model which represents
 that data.
 .
 Castor XML can be compared to XMLBeans framework.
 .
 Castor JDO is an Object-Relational Mapping and Data-Binding Framework.
 Castor can map relational database data into Java Data Object based
 on user-defined mapping schema. In the other point-of-view,
 it provides java data objects a persistence layer.
