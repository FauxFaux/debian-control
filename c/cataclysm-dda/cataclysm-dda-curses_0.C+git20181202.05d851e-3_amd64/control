Description: post-apocalyptic roguelike game - curses interface
 Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is a roguelike set in a post-apocalyptic world.
 .
 While some have described it as a "zombie game", there's far more to Cataclysm
 than that. Struggle to survive in a harsh, persistent, procedurally generated
 world. Scavenge the remnants of a dead civilization for food, equipment, or,
 if you're lucky, a vehicle with a full tank of gas to get you the hell out of
 Dodge. Fight to defeat or escape from a wide variety of powerful monstrosities,
 from zombies to giant insects to killer robots and things far stranger and
 deadlier, and against the others like yourself, that want what you have...
 .
 This package contains the text-only ncurses-based interface.
