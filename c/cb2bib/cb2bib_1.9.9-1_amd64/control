Description: extract bibliographic references from various sources
 cb2bib is a program to extract bibliographic references from
 unformatted and non standard sources, like:
  - email alerts;
  - journal Web pages;
  - and most interestingly PDF files.
 .
 Output references are written to BibTeX-formatted files. Other
 features include:
  - article files can be linked and renamed by dragging them onto the
    cb2Bib window;
  - editing and browsing BibTeX files;
  - citing references, searching references and the full contents of the
    referenced documents;
  - inserting bibliographic metadata to documents;
  - writing short notes that interrelate several references.
