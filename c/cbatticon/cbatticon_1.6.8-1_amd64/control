Description: lightweight and fast battery icon status and more
 Utility that displays battery information as battery status, remaining
 percentage, remaining time, using an icon in the system tray.
 .
 Based on code from xbattbar-acpi, cbatticon sits in your system tray,
 reporting on battery events, like plug-in, critical, remaining, etc.
 .
 A regular users can (re)define custom system's behaviour, like performing
 graceful shutdown on critical status, by user-defined thresholds and commands
 on low power/critical.
