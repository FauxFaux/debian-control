Description: development files for CBFlib
 CBFLIB is a library of ANSI-C functions providing a simple mechanism for
 accessing Crystallographic Binary Files (CBF files) and Image-supporting
 CIF (imgCIF) files. The CBFLIB API is loosely based on the CIFPARSE API for
 mmCIF files. CBFLIB does not perform any semantic integrity checks and
 simply provides functions to create, read, modify and write CBF
 binary data files and imgCIF ASCII data files.
 .
 This package contains libraries and header files for program development.
