Description: C Compiler for TI/Chipcon 8051-based RF SOCs
 This is a C compiler and related tools for developing firmware for
 TI/Chipcon RF System on Chip (SOC) parts based on the 8051 processing
 core.  These include at least the CC1110, CC1111, CC2510, and CC2511,
 CC2530, CC2531, CC2533, CC2543, and CC2544.
 .
 This package started as a fork of Debian SDCC 2.9.0-5, motivated both
 as a workaround for increases in the size of 8051 code generated by later
 versions of SDCC that cause AltOS to fail to build successfully, and a
 desire to incorporate support for source-level debugging on real hardware.
