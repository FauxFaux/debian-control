Description: source scanning build utility for C++
 Scan the source for main functions and includes. When the file
 contains a main function it will compile all the files next to that
 file's includes and link them into a program.
 .
 This makes it possible to build entire programs with minimal
 configuration. Linker and compiler options can be added and will be
 automatically divided over the compiler and linker.
