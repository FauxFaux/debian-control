Description: simplified-traditional chinese conversion tool
 The Chinese national GB standard defines a basic set of (around 6,000)
 characters for use with Simplified Chinese writing that does not include many
 of the characters in the Taiwanese industry standard for Traditional Chinese
 called Big5 (around 13,000 characters in the basic set). Unicode is however a
 superset of both with all duplication removed down to the level of detail
 described above.
 .
 This tool is used for converting a UTF-8 string which combining both
 Simplified Chinese characters and Traditional Chinese charcters directly into
 one type Chinese chareacters.
