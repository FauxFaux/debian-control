Description: suite of programs designed to quickly group sequences
 cd-hit contains a number of programs designed to quickly group
 sequences. cd-hit groups proteins into clusters that meet a user-defined
 similarity threshold. cd-hit-est is similar to cd-hit, but designed to
 group nucleotide sequences (without introns). cd-hit-est-2d is similar
 to cd-hit-2d but designed to compare two nucleotide datasets. A number
 of other related programs are also in this package. Please see the
 cd-hit user manual, also part of this package, for further information.
