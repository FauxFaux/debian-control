Description: Compute checksum of individual track on CD-ROMS
 CD-ROM Digest is a program that checks a multi-track CD-ROM.
 It reports the MD5 digest and size for each track on a CD-ROM.
 The digest is done as the track is read, without dumping CD-ROM data
 on the hard drive. This tool helps users that are burning a multi-track
 CD-ROM to check the result.
