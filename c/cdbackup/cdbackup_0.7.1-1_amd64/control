Description: CD-R(W) backup utility
 cdbackup and cdrestore are a pair of utilities designed to facilitate
 streaming backup to and from CD-R(W) disks.  Specifically, they were
 designed to work with dump/restore, but tar/cpio/whatever you want should
 work, so long as it writes to stdout for backups and reads from stdin for
 restores.
