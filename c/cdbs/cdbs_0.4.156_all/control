Description: common build system for Debian packages
 This package contains the Common Debian Build System, an abstract build
 system based on Makefile inheritance which is completely extensible and
 overridable.  In other words, CDBS provides a sane set of default rules
 upon which packages can build; any or all rules may be overridden as
 needed.
