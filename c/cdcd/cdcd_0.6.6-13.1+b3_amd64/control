Description: command line or console based CD player
 cdcd works in two ways, accepting commands directly off the command line or in
 a query mode similar to other UNIX programs. To pass a command to cdcd, simply
 run cdcd with the command as the argument (e.g. cdcd play). This is great for
 using cron and cdcd together to make a CD alarm clock. Or you can run cdcd
 without arguments and you will be given the cdcd command prompt.
