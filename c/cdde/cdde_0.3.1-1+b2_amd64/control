Description: CD Detect & Execute utility
 CDDE is a program that detects when a CD/DVD-ROM drive has a disc
 inserted. When it finds a disc inserted in the drive it will attempt
 to determine the type of the disc, and execute a specified command.
 This means a DVD can be inserted and your favorite DVD software will
 start, or a data CD can be automatically mounted, etc. The commands
 are defined in a configuration file that has simple XML syntax.
