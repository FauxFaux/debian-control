Description: Library for finding vertices of convex polytopes, development
 The cddlib library is a C library for manipulating general convex
 polyhedra.  It supports converting between the system of linear
 inequalities representation and a vertices and extreme rays
 representation of a polyhedron, and also supports solving linear
 programming problems.
 .
 This package contains the cddlib development files.
