Description: Programs using libcdd
 The cddlib library is a C library for manipulating general convex
 polyhedra.  It supports converting between the system of linear
 inequalities representation and a vertices and extreme rays
 representation of a polyhedron, and also supports solving linear
 programming problems.
 .
 This package contains example programs using libcdd, for example
 cdd_both_reps, which computes minimal H- and V-representations
 of a given convex polytope.
