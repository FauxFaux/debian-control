Description: Turn English phrases to C or C++ declarations
 Cdecl is a program which will turn English-like phrases such as "declare
 foo as array 5 of pointer to function returning int" into C declarations
 such as "int (*foo[5])()". It can also translate the C into the pseudo-
 English. And it handles typecasts, too. Plus C++. And in this version
 it has command line editing and history with the GNU readline library.
