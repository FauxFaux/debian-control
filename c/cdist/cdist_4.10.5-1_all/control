 It adheres to the KISS principle and is being used in
 small up to enterprise grade environments. It has the
 following noteworthy features:
 .
  * shell scripting configuration language
  * access to all control structures (if, case, for, while)
  * idempotent target properties
  * zero-dependencies: target system need only /bin/sh and ssh
  * push-based distribution
  * highly-scalable
 .
 cdist is an alternative to other configuration management systems
 like cfengine, bcfg2, chef and puppet.
