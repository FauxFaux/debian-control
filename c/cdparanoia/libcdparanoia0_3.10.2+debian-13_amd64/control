Description: audio extraction tool for sampling CDs (library)
 An audio extraction tool for sampling CDs. Unlike similar programs such as
 cdda2wav, cdparanoia goes to great lengths to try to extract the audio
 information without any artifacts such as jitter.
 .
 This package contains the library of cdparanoia, so that its routines
 can be used by other programs.
