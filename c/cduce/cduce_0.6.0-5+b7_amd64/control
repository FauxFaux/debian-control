Description: programming language adapted to the manipulation of XML data
 CDuce is a modern programming language adapted to the manipulation of
 XML documents.
 .
 Some of CDuce's peculiar features:
  - XML objects can be manipulated as first-class citizen values:
    elements, sequences, tags, characters and strings, attribute sets;
    sequences of XML elements can be specified by regular expressions,
    which also apply to characters strings;
  - functions themselves are first-class values, they can be
    manipulated, stored in data structure, returned by a function,...;
  - a powerful pattern matching operation can perform complex
    extractions from sequences of XML elements;
  - a rich type algebra, with recursive types and arbitrary boolean
    combinations (union, intersection, complement) allows precise
    definitions of data structures and XML types; general purpose
    types and types constructors are taken seriously (products,
    extensible records, arbitrary precision integers with interval
    constraints, Unicode characters);
  - polymorphism through a natural notion of subtyping, and overloaded
    functions with dynamic dispatch; - an highly-effective type-driven
    compilation schema.
 .
 CDuce is fast, functional, type-safe, and conforms to basic
 standards: Unicode, XML, DTD, Namespaces are fully supported, partial
 support of XML Schema validation is in alpha testing (and
 undocumented) while queries are being implemented.
