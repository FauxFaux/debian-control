Description: OpenStack efficient metering counters system - Polling agent
 Ceilometer aims to deliver a Single Point Of Contact for billing systems,
 providing all the counters they need to establish customer billing, across
 all current and future OpenStack components. The delivery of counters must be
 traceable and auditable, the counters must be easily extensible to support new
 projects, and agents doing data collections should be independent of the
 overall system.
 .
 (A ceilometer is an instrument that measures cloud coverage.)
 .
 This package contains the polling service.
