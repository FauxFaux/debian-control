Description: Cross-platform graphical frontend for the CEN64 emulator
 CEN64-Qt is a cross-platform graphical frontend for the CEN64 emulator. Since
 CEN64 itself provides a simple command line interface only, anyone who wants
 to use this particular emulator with a little more convenience has to resort
 to additional software which is where this package jumps in.
 .
 The frontend lists all available ROMs after adding them to the inventory with
 the option to download additional information from external game databases on
 the web. File paths for the necessary IPL files can be conveniently configured
 from the settings menu as well as the paths where games save a stored and
 recovered from.
 .
 Additional features include a log viewer for the emulator, a configurable view
 for the ROM listing as well as a quick access menu to select the preferred
 input device for the emulator such as different gamepads and a keyboard.
 .
 Naturally, all settings are automatically saved and restored such that they
 only need to be configured once.
