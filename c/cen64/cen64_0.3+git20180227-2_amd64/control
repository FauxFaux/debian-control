Description: Cycle-Accurate Nintendo 64 Simulator
 CEN64 is a new Nintendo 64 emulator which aims for perfect emulation by
 simulating the hardware inside the Nintendo 64 itself, down to the
 register-transfer level (RTL). It is still heavy under development and
 currently does not have any sound emulation.
 .
 Being a cycle-accurate emulator, CEN64 has considerably high hardware
 requirements to achieve passable performance when emulating most Nintendo 64
 titles. However, similar to the higan emulator, the cycle accuracy guarantess
 very high compatibility and despite its early development stage, CEN64 already
 allows one to run several commercial titles without or with only minor
 glitches.
 .
 As a distinctive feature among Nintendo 64 emulators, CEN64 offers emulation
 support for the 64DD external disk drive that was never released outside Japan
 and even there is considered rare. Thus, CEN64 offers the unique possibility
 for anyone to play any of the rare titles that were exclusively released on the
 64DD.
