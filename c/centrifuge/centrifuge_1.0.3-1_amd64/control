Description: rapid and memory-efficient system for classification of DNA sequences
 Centrifuge is a very rapid and memory-efficient system for the
 classification of DNA sequences from microbial samples, with better
 sensitivity than and comparable accuracy to other leading systems. The
 system uses a novel indexing scheme based on the Burrows-Wheeler
 transform (BWT) and the Ferragina-Manzini (FM) index, optimized
 specifically for the metagenomic classification problem. Centrifuge
 requires a relatively small index (e.g., 4.3 GB for ~4,100 bacterial
 genomes) yet provides very fast classification speed, allowing it to
 process a typical DNA sequencing run within an hour. Together these
 advances enable timely and accurate analysis of large metagenomics data
 sets on conventional desktop computers.
