Description: nonlinear least squares minimizer (shared library)
 Ceres Solver is an open source C++ library for modeling and solving large,
 complicated optimization problems.
 It is a feature rich, mature and performant library which has been used
 in production at Google since 2010.
 .
 Ceres Solver can solve two kinds of problems.
  - Non-linear Least Squares problems with bounds constraints.
  - General unconstrained optimization problems.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
