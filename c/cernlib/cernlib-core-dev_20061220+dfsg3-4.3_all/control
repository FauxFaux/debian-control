Description: CERNLIB data analysis suite - core development files
 CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for
 use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other
 fields such as the biological sciences.
 .
 This metapackage provides the header files and static libraries needed
 by developers using the CERN libraries and not specifically interested in high
 energy physics. It also provides the CERNLIB development tools: DZedit,
 KUIPC, and the Nypatchy family of programs. CERNLIB analysis programs may be
 obtained by installing the cernlib-core metapackage.
