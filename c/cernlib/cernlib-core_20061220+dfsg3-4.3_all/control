Description: CERNLIB data analysis suite - main libraries and programs
 CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for
 use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other
 fields such as the biological sciences.
 .
 This metapackage provides the libraries and analysis tools (e.g. PAW) likely
 to be wanted by most users of the CERN libraries who are not interested
 specifically in high energy physics. It does not provide development
 libraries or tools; those may be obtained by installing the cernlib-core-dev
 metapackage or individual lib*-dev packages.
