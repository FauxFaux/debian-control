Description: CERNLIB data analysis suite - extra programs
 CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for
 use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other
 fields such as the biological sciences.
 .
 This metapackage provides a few additional CERNLIB programs not included
 in any other CERNLIB package. Very few people are likely to be
 interested in them; currently they include zftp, pawserv and zserv.
 The latter two programs run as daemons through inetd and may
 raise concerns about the system's security.
 .
 Installing this package along with the 'cernlib' metapackage will supply
 a complete set of all CERNLIB programs and libraries, except for those
 not included in Debian due to licensing reasons.
