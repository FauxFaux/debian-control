Description: CERNLIB data analysis suite - general use metapackage
 CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for
 use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other
 fields such as the biological sciences.
 .
 This metapackage provides almost all of the programs and libraries contained
 in CERNLIB. Most people will likely want only a subset of these. A few
 extra CERNLIB programs, not of interest to many people, may be obtained via
 the cernlib-extras metapackage.
