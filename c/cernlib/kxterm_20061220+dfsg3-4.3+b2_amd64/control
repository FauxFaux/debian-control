Description: CERNLIB data analysis suite - KUIP terminal emulator
 CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for
 use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other
 fields such as the biological sciences.
 .
 KXterm is a terminal emulator which combines the best features from
 the (now defunct) Apollo DM pads (like: input and transcript
 pads, automatic file backup of transcript pad, string search in pads,
 etc.) and the Korn shell emacs-style command line editing and command
 line recall mechanism. It can support the command-line interface
 of various CERNLIB applications.
