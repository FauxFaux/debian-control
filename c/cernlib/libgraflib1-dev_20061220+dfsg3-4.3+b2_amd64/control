Description: CERNLIB data analysis suite - graphical library (development files)
 CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for
 use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other
 fields such as the biological sciences.
 .
 The graflib library includes the HPLOT and DZDOC systems. HPLOT is a
 graphing facility intended to produce drawings and slides of histograms
 (and other data) of a quality suitable to talks and publications. DZDOC
 provides a method of viewing CERNLIB's ZEBRA data structures.
 .
 This package includes a static version of graflib, as well as C and FORTRAN
 header files.
