Description: CERNLIB data analysis suite - interface to X11 and PostScript (development)
 CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for
 use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other
 fields such as the biological sciences.
 .
 This package includes a static version of libgrafX11, also known as HIGZ
 (High-level Interface to Graphics and ZEBRA), an interface to the X Window
 System. In addition to basic drawing functions, HIGZ includes a PostScript
 interface. Also included are C and FORTRAN header files.
