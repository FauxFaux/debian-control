Description: CERNLIB data analysis suite - core library of basic functions (development)
 CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for
 use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other
 fields such as the biological sciences.
 .
 The kernlib library contains a rather miscellaneous set of basic numerical,
 bitwise, and system-dependent functions used by other CERN libraries and
 programs.
 .
 This package includes the static version of kernlib, as well as
 C and FORTRAN header files.
