Description: CERNLIB data analysis suite - patch pre-processor for source code
 CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for
 use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other
 fields such as the biological sciences.
 .
 This package contains the Nypatchy family of programs, the successors to
 Patchy and Ypatchy.  These programs are intended for working with sets of
 patches (for instance, for use on different machine architectures) meant to
 be applied to a source code tree.  The patch sets and common source code are
 maintained as a single text-based Patchy Master file (PAM file).  PAM files
 can contain C, FORTRAN, or assembly code.
 .
 Nypatchy and related utilities can perform actions on a PAM file such as
 updating it; comparing it to an older version; or outputting source code
 suitable for input to a compiler, having selected some subset of available
 patches to use.  These utilities can be used interactively, or can run in
 batch mode from a "cradle" file of commands.
 .
 While Nypatchy is still used in places, mainly high-energy physics, these
 programs are no longer under active development.  They are not recommended
 for use in new projects.
