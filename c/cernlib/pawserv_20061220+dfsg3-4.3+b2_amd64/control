Description: CERNLIB data analysis suite - distributed PAW and file transfer servers
 CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for
 use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other
 fields such as the biological sciences.
 .
 This package contains the server daemon for remote PAW clients. PAW
 is the Physics Analysis Workstation, a graphical analysis program.
 Included in the same binary is zserv, the server daemon for the ZFTP protocol;
 zserv is a macro-extensible file transfer program which supports the
 transfer of formatted, unformatted and ZEBRA RZ files (CMZ, HBOOK, etc.).
 It is similar to a standard FTP daemon, although it listens on a different
 port. Both servers operate through inetd.
 .
 Since these servers accept passwords in clear text and do not support SSL
 or other encryption methods, you should probably only install this package
 within a trusted LAN. It should be seen as equivalent to vanilla telnetd
 in terms of security (or lack thereof).
