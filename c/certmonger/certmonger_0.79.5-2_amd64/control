Description: D-Bus -based service to simplify interaction with certificate authorities
 Certmonger is a D-Bus -based service which attempts to simplify
 interaction with certifying authorities (CAs) on networks which use
 public-key infrastructure (PKI).
 .
 If it knows the location of a certificate, certmonger can track the
 expiration date and notify you when the certificate is about to expire.
 .
 If it has access to the corresponding private key and information about
 the CA which issued the certificate, certmonger can even attempt to
 automatically obtain a new certificate.
 .
 Supports certificate and key storage in PEM or NSSDB formats.
 .
 Can self-sign certificates, or can submit them to either certmaster or
 development versions of IPA.
