Description: Certificate Transparency Log Monitor
 Cert Spotter is a Certificate Transparency log monitor from SSLMate that
 alerts you when a SSL/TLS certificate is issued for one of your domains.
 Cert Spotter is easier than other open source CT monitors, since it does
 not require a database. It's also more robust, since it uses a special
 certificate parser that ensures it won't miss certificates.
 .
 Cert Spotter is also available as a hosted service by SSLMate,
 <https://sslmate.com/certspotter>
 .
 You can use Cert Spotter to detect:
  * Certificates issued to attackers who have compromised a certificate
    authority and want to impersonate your site.
  * Certificates issued to attackers who are using your infrastructure
    to serve malware.
  * Certificates issued in violation of your corporate policy
    or outside of your centralized certificate procurement process.
  * Certificates issued to your infrastructure providers without your
    consent.
