Description: Tool for configuring and maintaining network machines
 The main purpose of cfengine is to allow the system administrator
 to create a single central file which will define how every host
 on a network should be configured.
 .
 It takes a while to set up cfengine for a network (especially an
 already existing network), but once that is done you will wonder
 how you ever lived without it!
