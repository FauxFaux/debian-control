Description: tool for configuring and maintaining network machines
 Cfengine is a suite of programs for integrated autonomic management
 of either individual or networked computers.
 .
 Cfengine 3 is both a more powerful and much simplified version of cfengine,
 which has been designed to inter operate with cfengine 2 rather than be
 backwards compatible with it.
 .
 With cfengine 3 you can install, configure and maintain computers using
 powerful hands-free tools.
