Description: Multi-modal connectome and metadata management and integration
 The Connectome File Format Library (cfflib) is a Python module for
 multi-modal neuroimaging connectome data and metadata management and
 integration.
 .
 It enables single subject and multi-subject data integration for a
 variety of modalities, such as networks, surfaces, volumes, fiber
 tracks, timeseries, scripts, arbitrary data objects such as
 homogeneous arrays or CSV/JSON files. It relies on existing Python
 modules and the standard library for basic data I/O, and adds a layer
 of metadata annotation as tags or with structured properties to
 individual data objects.
