Description: configurable finger daemon
 This is a free replacement for standard finger daemons such as GNU
 fingerd and MIT fingerd.  Cfingerd can enable/disable finger services
 to individual users, rather than to all users on a given host.  It is
 able to respond to a finger request to a specified user by running a
 shell script (e.g., finger doorbell@mysite.mydomain might cause a
 sound file to be sent) rather than just a plain text file.
