Description: Analyze control flow in C source files
 GNU cflow analyzes a collection of C source files and prints a graph, charting
 control flow within the program.

 GNU cflow is able to produce both direct and inverted flowgraphs for C
 sources. Optionally a cross-reference listing can be generated. Two output
 formats are implemented: POSIX and GNU (extended).

 Input files can optionally be preprocessed before analyzing.
