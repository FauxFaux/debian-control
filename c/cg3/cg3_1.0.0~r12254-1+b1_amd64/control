Description: Tools for using the 3rd edition of Constraint Grammar (CG-3)
 Constraint Grammar compiler and applicator for the 3rd edition of CG
 that is developed and maintained by VISL SDU and GrammarSoft ApS.
 .
 CG-3 can be used for disambiguation of morphology, syntax, semantics, etc;
 dependency markup, target language lemma choice for MT, QA systems, and
 much more. The core idea is that you choose what to do based on the whole
 available context, as opposed to n-grams.
 .
