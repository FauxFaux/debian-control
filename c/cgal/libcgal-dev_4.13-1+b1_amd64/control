Description: C++ library for computational geometry (development files)
 CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library) makes the most important
 of the solutions and methods developed in computational geometry available
 to users in industry and academia in a C++ library. The goal is to provide
 easy access to useful, reliable geometric algorithms.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static libraries for libCGAL.so,
 libCGAL_Core.so, and libCGAL_ImageIO.so. The  header files and static
 libraries for libCGAL_Qt5.so can be found in the package libcgal-qt5-dev.
