Description: C++ library for computational geometry (support for Qt5)
 CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library) makes the most important
 of the solutions and methods developed in computational geometry available
 to users in industry and academia in a C++ library. The goal is to provide
 easy access to useful, reliable geometric algorithms.
 .
 The CGAL library contains:
  - the Kernel with geometric primitives such as points, vectors, lines,
    predicates for testing things such as relative positions of points, and
    operations such as intersections and distance calculation.
  - the Basic Library which is a collection of standard data structures and
    geometric algorithms, such as convex hull in 2D/3D, (Delaunay)
    triangulation in 2D/3D, planar map, polyhedron, smallest enclosing circle,
    and multidimensional query structures.
  - the Support Library which offers interfaces to other packages, e.g., for
    visualisation, and I/O, and other support facilities.
 .
 This package contains libCGAL_Qt5.so used for visualization in demos.
