Description: C++ library for computational geometry
 CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library) makes the most important
 of the solutions and methods developed in computational geometry available
 to users in industry and academia in a C++ library. The goal is to provide
 easy access to useful, reliable geometric algorithms.
 .
 The CGAL library contains:
  - the Kernel with geometric primitives such as points, vectors, lines,
    predicates for testing things such as relative positions of points, and
    operations such as intersections and distance calculation.
  - the Basic Library which is a collection of standard data structures and
    geometric algorithms, such as convex hull in 2D/3D, (Delaunay)
    triangulation in 2D/3D, planar map, polyhedron, smallest enclosing circle,
    and multidimensional query structures.
  - the Support Library which offers interfaces to other packages, e.g., for
    visualisation, and I/O, and other support facilities.
 .
 This package contains the main library libCGAL.so as well as two support
 libraries libCGAL_Core.so (from the CORE project) and libCGAL_ImageIO.so
 (image I/O). The library libCGAL_Qt5.so used for visualization in demos
 can be found in the package libcgal-qt5-13.
