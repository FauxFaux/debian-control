Description: curses-based interface to the GNU Debugger (GDB)
 CGDB is a curses  frontend to the GNU Debugger (GDB). The goal of CGDB is
 to be lightweight and responsive; not encumbered with unnecessary features.
 .
 The interface is designed to deliver the familiar GDB text interface, with a
 split screen showing the source as it executes. The UI is modeled on the
 classic Unix text editor, vi. Those familiar with vi should feel right at home
 using CGDB.
 .
 Some features offered by CGDB are:
   * Syntax-highlighted source window
   * Visual breakpoint setting
   * Keyboard shortcuts for common functions
   * Searching source window (using regexp)
