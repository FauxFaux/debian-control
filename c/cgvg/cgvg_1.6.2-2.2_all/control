Description: command-line source browsing tool
 cgvg is a pair of Perl scripts ("cg" and "vg") which are meant to
 assist a programmer in doing command-line source browsing.
 .
 The idea is you can easily search for keywords in the code, and jump
 to the file and line where a match is found. Used with ctags(1), this
 can really help with jumping around and following code. Some features
 include a human-readable output, coloring, bolding (and alternate
 bolding), and just sheer convenience for a programmer.
 .
 cgvg uses the Perl internal find and does its own searching, rather
 than being a wrapper for UNIX find(1) and grep(1). There is a
 ~/.cgvgrc file for per-user configuration, and some nice features
 like coloring, and multiple log files.
