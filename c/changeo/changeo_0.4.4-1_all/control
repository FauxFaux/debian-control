Description: Repertoire clonal assignment toolkit (Python 3)
 Change-O is a collection of tools for processing the output of V(D)J
 alignment tools, assigning clonal clusters to immunoglobulin (Ig)
 sequences, and reconstructing germline sequences.
 .
 Dramatic improvements in high-throughput sequencing technologies now
 enable large-scale characterization of Ig repertoires, defined as the
 collection of trans-membrane antigen-receptor proteins located on the
 surface of B cells and T cells. Change-O is a suite of utilities to
 facilitate advanced analysis of Ig and TCR sequences following germline
 segment assignment. Change-O handles output from IMGT/HighV-QUEST
 and IgBLAST, and provides a wide variety of clustering methods for
 assigning clonal groups to Ig sequences. Record sorting, grouping,
 and various database manipulation operations are also included.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
