Description: user-defined software stacks (UDSS) for HPC centers
 Charliecloud provides user-defined software stacks (UDSS) (aka containers)
 for high-performance computing (HPC) centers. This "bring your own software
 stack" functionality addresses needs such as: software dependencies that are
 numerous, complex, unusual, differently configured, or simply newer/older
 than what the center provides; build-time requirements unavailable within
 the center, such as relatively unfettered internet access; validated
 software stacks and configuration to meet the standards of a particular
 field of inquiry; portability of environments between resources, including
 workstations and other test and development system not managed by the
 center; consistent environments, even archivally so, that can be easily,
 reliabily, and verifiably reproduced in the future; and/or usability and
 comprehensibility.
