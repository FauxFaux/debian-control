Description: fast, scalable irc server
 Charybdis is a highly scalable IRC server which presently implements
 the IRCv3.1 client protocol with some additional components of
 IRCv3.2. Development of charybdis began in 2005 as a proposed
 replacement to freenode’s hyperion ircd, designed for use by any
 network, with roots in ircd-ratbox and ircu. Over time, charybdis has
 developed, tested and demonstrated many of the features commonly seen
 in modern IRC networks.
 .
 Interesting features that Charybdis has include:
 .
  * SASL support — charybdis was the first IRC server to implement SASL
    support, resulting in the IRCv3 SASL standards.
  * DNS blocklist support
  * Augmented banlist criteria through “extbans”
  * Channel forwarding (channel mode +f)
  * Optional hostname/IP cloaking (through modules, either usermode +h or
    +x)
  * Colorcode stripping (channel mode +c)
  * CALLERID (user mode +g) with automatic accept when you send a PM
  * TLS encrypted client and server connections
  * Multi-process sandbox architecture for enhanced security, scalability
    and robustness
  * Easy to understand configuration
  * A complete user and operator’s manual
 .
 Many of the largest networks in the world use charybdis-based IRC
 servers, including freenode, EsperNet, DarkMyst and others, because
 of it’s proven scalability, security and robustness track records
