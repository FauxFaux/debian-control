Description: simple SMTP (email) server written in go
 chasquid is an SMTP (email) server with a focus on simplicity, security, and
 ease of operation.
 .
 It's written in Go, and is open source under the Apache license 2.0.
 .
 It is currently in beta: it's functional and has had some production exposure,
 but some things may still change in backwards-incompatible ways, including the
 configuration format. It should be rare and will be avoided if possible.
