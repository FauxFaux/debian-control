Description: WSGI Server for Circus
 Chaussette is a WSGI server you can use to run your Python WSGI applications.
 .
 The particularity of Chaussette is that it can either bind a socket on a port
 like any other server does or run against already opened sockets.
 .
 That makes Chaussette the best companion to run a WSGI or Django stack under
 a process and socket manager, such as Circus or Supervisor.
