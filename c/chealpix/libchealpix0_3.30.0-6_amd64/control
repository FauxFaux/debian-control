Description: HEALPix representation of spherical data - C shared library
 HEALPix is an acronym for Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization
 of a sphere. As suggested in the name, this pixelization produces a
 subdivision of a spherical surface in which each pixel covers the same
 surface area as every other pixel. It is commonly used to store all-sky
 astronomical images, most famously maps of the cosmic microwave background.
 .
 This package provides the dynamic library for the C language implementation
 of HEALPix. The C library provides basic input/output of HEALPix maps as well
 as basic spatial operations like conversion between spherical coordinates and
 HEALPix pixels.
