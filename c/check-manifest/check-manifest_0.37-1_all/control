Description: Tool to check the completeness of MANIFEST.in for Python packages (Python 3)
 The check-manifest tool performs a check on a MANIFEST.in file
 from a Python project and verifies its completeness.  It can also
 create a MANIFEST.in file from scratch or append suggestions to it,
 and the user can also ignore certain patterns if needed.
