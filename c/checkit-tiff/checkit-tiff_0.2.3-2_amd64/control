Description: conformance checker for baseline TIFFs
 "checkit_tiff" is a conformance checker for baseline TIFFs (with various
 extensions). It works in different way than other tools. Instead to use
 a hardcoded rule set with predefined values, you are able to define tags
 and corresponding values more fine granulary. The rulesets are human
 readable and could be adapted to own needs.
 .
 The "checkit_tiff" works on commandline and therefore it is embedable
 in scripts
 .
 The tools are developed for purposes of curation and longterm
 preservation
