Description: text-based template engine and Python code generator (Python 3)
 Cheetah can be used as a standalone templating utility or referenced as a
 library from other Python applications. It has many potential uses, but web
 developers looking for a viable alternative to ASP, JSP, PHP and PSP are
 expected to be its principle user group.
 .
 Features:
  * Generates HTML, SGML, XML, SQL, Postscript, form email, LaTeX, or any other
    text-based format.
  * Cleanly separates content, graphic design, and program code.
  * Blends the power and flexibility of Python with a simple template language
    that non-programmers can understand.
  * Gives template writers full access to any Python data structure, module,
    function, object, or method in their templates.
  * Makes code reuse easy by providing an object-orientated interface to
    templates that is accessible from Python code or other Cheetah templates.
    One template can subclass another and selectively reimplement sections of
    it.
  * Provides a simple, yet powerful, caching mechanism that can dramatically
    improve the performance of a dynamic website.
  * Compiles templates into optimized, yet readable, Python code.

 This package contains the Python 3 module.
