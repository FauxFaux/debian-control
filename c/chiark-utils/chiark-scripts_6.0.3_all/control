Description: chiark system administration scripts
 This package contains a number of small administration scripts used
 by chiark.greenend.org.uk and other systems belonging to the Sinister
 Greenend Organisation.  Featuring:
 .
 fishdescriptor: a tool for extracting a file descriptor from
 another (non-cooperating) process and giving it to you (or
 for examining it).  Requires gdb and python3.
 .
 chiark-named-conf: a tool for managing nameserver configurations
 and checking for suspected DNS problems.  Its main functions are to
 check that delegations are appropriate and working, that secondary
 zones are slaved from the right places, and to generate a
 configuration for BIND, from its own input file.
 .
 sync-accounts: a simple but flexible account info synchroniser.
 sync-accounts is a tool for copying un*x account data from remote
 systems and installing it locally.  It is flexible and reasonably
 straightforward, but lacks integration with other distributed
 databases such as NIS.
 .
 cvs-repomove and cvs-adjustroot: tools for moving CVS repositories
 and adjusting working trees.
 .
 palm-datebook-reminders: a program which emails mails you reminders
 about the appointments in your Palm's Datebook.
 .
 cvsweb-list: cgi program to list ucgi (userv-utils) cvsweb repos
 .
 expire-iso8601: keep or expire backup trees named after their dates
 .
 gnucap2genspic, ngspice2genspic, genspic2gnuplot: convert gnucap
 files and ngspice output files to genspic and genspic files to
 gnuplot input so they can be plotted.
 .
 hexterm: connects to serial port and allows the user interact in
 ASCII and hex.  Ie, a hex "terminal" program which lets you speak a
 serial port protocol directly.  (Needs tcl8.4 to be installed.)
 .
 git-branchmove, random-word, remountresizereiserfs,
 summarise-mailbox-preserving-privacy
