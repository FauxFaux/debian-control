Description: Practical and portable Scheme system - runtime
 CHICKEN is a Scheme compiler which compiles a subset of R5RS into C.
 It uses the ideas presented in Baker's paper "Cheney on the MTA", and
 has a small core and is easily extendable.
 .
 This package contains the shared library needed to run programs using
 chicken.
