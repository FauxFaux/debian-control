Description: rootkit detector
 The chkrootkit security scanner searches the local system for signs
 that it is infected with a 'rootkit'. Rootkits are set of programs
 and hacks designed to take control of a target machine by using known
 security flaws.
 .
 Types that chkrootkit can identify are listed on the project's home page.
 .
 Please note that where chkrootkit detects no intrusions, this does
 not guarantee that the system is uncompromised. In addition to
 running chkrootkit, more specific tests should always be performed.
