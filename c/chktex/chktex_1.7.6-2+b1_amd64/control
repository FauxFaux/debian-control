Description: Finds typographic errors in LaTeX
 ChkTeX finds typographic errors in LaTeX documents:
  * Supports over 40 warnings.
  * Supports ``\input'' command; both TeX and LaTeX version. Actually
    includes the files. ``TEXINPUTS''-equivalent search path.
  * Intelligent warning/error handling. The user may promote/mute
    warnings to suit his preferences. You may also mute warnings in
    the header of a file; thus killing much unwanted garbage.
  * Supports both LaTeX 2.09 and LaTeX2e.
  * Flexible output handling. Has some predefined formats and lets the
    user specify his own format. Uses a ``printf()'' similar syntax.
    ``lacheck'' compatible mode included for interfacing with the
    AUC-TeX Emacs mode.
