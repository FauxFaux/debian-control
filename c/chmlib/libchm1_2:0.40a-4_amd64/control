Description: library for dealing with Microsoft CHM files
 It is a very simple library, but sufficient for dealing with all of the chm
 files. Library currently does not has write support.
 .
 CHM files are used on the Microsoft Windows platform to store program
 documentation, almost always in the form of HTML, with some non-standard
 quirks. CHM files are a form of archive known as InfoTech Storage Format
 (ITSF) files and contain some special files to implement features of the
 CHM viewer.
