Description: Concurrent, On-the-fly Audio Programming Language
 ChucK is a new audio programming language for real-time synthesis,
 composition, and performance, which runs on commodity operating systems.
 .
 ChucK presents a new time-based concurrent programming model, which supports
 multiple, simultaneous, dynamic control rates, and the ability to add, remove,
 and modify code, on-the-fly, while the program is running, without stopping or
 restarting.
