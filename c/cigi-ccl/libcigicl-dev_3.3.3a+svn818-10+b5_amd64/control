Description: development files for the CIGI class library (CCL)
 This package contains development libraries and headers for the CIGI
 class library (CCL).  The primary goal of the Common Image Generator
 Interface (CIGI) standard is to standardise the interface between a
 simulators host computer and the Image Generator.  The CCL is a C++
 language library for implementing CIGI in both host and IG
 applications.
 .
 Some features of the CCL include:
 .
  * Handles packing, unpacking, and byte swapping automatically
  * Handles output buffer management
  * Can handle most of the input buffer management with simple calls
  * Can translate between different versions of CIGI
