Description: runtime library for the CIGI class library (CCL)
 This package contains the runtime library for the CIGI class library
 (CCL).  The primary goal of the Common Image Generator Interface
 (CIGI) standard is to standardise the interface between a simulators
 host computer and the Image Generator.  The CCL is a C++ language
 library for implementing CIGI in both host and IG applications.
 .
 Some features of the CCL include:
 .
  * Handles packing, unpacking, and byte swapping automatically
  * Handles output buffer management
  * Can handle most of the input buffer management with simple calls
  * Can translate between different versions of CIGI
