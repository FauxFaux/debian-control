Description: documentation of cimg-dev imaging library
 The CImg Library is a C++ toolkit providing simple classes and functions
 to load, save, process and display images in your own C++ code. It consists
 only of a single header file CImg.h that must be included in your program
 source. It contains useful image processing algorithms for loading/saving,
 resizing/rotating, filtering, object drawing (text, lines, faces,
 ellipses, ...), etc.
 .
 Images are instantiated by a class able to represent images up to 4-dimension
 wide (from 1-D scalar signals to 3-D volumes of vector-valued pixels), with
 template pixel types. It depends on a minimal number of libraries : you can
 compile it with only standard C libraries. No need for exotic libraries and
 complex dependencies.
 .
 This package contains the documentation.
