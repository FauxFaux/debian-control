Description: Perl module implementing CipherSaber encryption
 The Crypt::CipherSaber module implements CipherSaber encryption,
 described at http://ciphersaber.gurus.com.  It is simple, fairly
 speedy, and relatively secure algorithm based on RC4.
 .
 Encryption and decryption are done based on a secret key, which
 must be shared with all intended recipients of a message.
