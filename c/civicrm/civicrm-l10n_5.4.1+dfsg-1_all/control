Description: CiviCRM country and language data
 CiviCRM is web-based, Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) software
 geared toward meeting the needs of non-profit and other civic-sector
 organizations.
 .
 As a non profit committed to the public good itself, CiviCRM understands
 that forging and growing strong relationships with constituents is about
 more than collecting and tracking constituent data - it is about sustaining
 relationships with supporters over time.
 .
 With CiviCRM's robust feature set, organizations can further their mission
 through contact management, fundraising, event management, member
 management, mass e-mail marketing, peer-to-peer campaigns, case management,
 and much more.
 .
 This package contains CiviCRM language files and countries data.
