Description: automatic build tool for ROOT data analysis software
 ckon is a C++ program/tool which automatically takes care of compilation,
 dictionary generation and linking of programs and libraries developed for data
 analyses within the CERN ROOT analysis framework. This includes parsing
 include headers to figure out which libraries the main programs need to be
 linked to.  It uses automake/autoconf to be platform independent and GNU
 install compliant.  In addition, m4 macros are automatically downloaded and the
 according compiler flags included based on a list of boost libraries provided
 in the config file.  For the purpose of YAML database usage, a m4 macro can be
 downloaded during setup to link against the yaml-cpp library.
