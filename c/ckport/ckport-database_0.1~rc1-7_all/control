Description: portability analysis and security checking tool (Database files)
 ckport is a tool to check already compiled binaries and libraries for porting
 and security problems.
 .
 It uses objdump to read the binaries and analyses calls and jumps to functions.
 .
 This package is architecture independent and can be used on non-host
 architecture binaries if an objdump tool for the target architecture
 is installed.
 .
 This package contains some common databases.
 Libraries should provide own databases.
