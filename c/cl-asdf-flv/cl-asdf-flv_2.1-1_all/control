Description: file-local variables through Common Lisp's ASDF
 ASDF-FLV provides support for file-local variables through ASDF (the Common
 Lisp standard utility for building projects and declaring dependencies between
 them).
 .
 A file-local variable behaves like *PACKAGE* and *READTABLE* with respect to
 LOAD and COMPILE-FILE: a new dynamic binding is created before processing the
 file, so that any modification to the variable essentially becomes file-local.
