Description: Another System Definition Facility
 ASDF provides the functionality of make and ld.so for Common Lisp software:
 It drives compilation and dynamic loading for complex Lisp systems
 with multiple modules and files, and is the de facto standard used
 by free software written in Common Lisp.
 .
 It also includes a utility library, UIOP, to portably deal with many issues
 that all Common Lisp programs have to deal with, including handling pathnames,
 accessing the filesystem, executing external programs, user configuration, etc.
 .
 Most Common Lisp implementations already provide asdf via (require "asdf"),
 but not all of them provide an up-to-date version.
