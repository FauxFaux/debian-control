Description: Common Lisp library providing easy CSV reading and writing
 This Common Lisp library aims to simplify working with CSVs:
 .
  * reads/writes CSVs from/to strings, streams and files
  * support streaming reads (allowing processing very large CSVs, through
    read-csv's row-fn parameter)
  * supports custom data formatting
  * settable quote, separator and quote-escapes
  * supports multiline quoted data
  * a test suite
  * detailed state about the process on error (line number, column number,
    char index), current collection state
