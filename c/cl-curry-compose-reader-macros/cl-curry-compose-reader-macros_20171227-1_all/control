Description: Reader macros for function partial application and composition.
 These reader macros expand into the curry, rcurry and compose functions
 from the Alexandria library. The contents of curly brackets are curried and
 the contents of square brackets are composed. The _ symbol inside curly
 brackets changes the order of arguments with rcurry.
