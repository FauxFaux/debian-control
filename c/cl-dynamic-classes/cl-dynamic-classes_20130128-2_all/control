Description: Common Lisp Dynamic Classes
 Class-mixins are a great idea but sometimes they lead to a proliferation of
 subclasses with names like
 printable-touchable-composing-colored-shape-square-mixin and that's just
 ugly. Common-Lisp is a dynamic-programming language; Dynamic-Classes brings
 dynamism to class definition!
