Description: simple regression testing framework for Common Lisp
 It has been designed with Common Lisp's interactive development model in
 mind.
 .
 Features:
  - Test and test suite hierarchies allow test to be organized into hierarchies
    to ease running.
  - Functions for re-running recently run tests.
  - Inter-test dependencies.
  - Specification based testing ala QuickCheck.
  - Redefined macros are instantly seen by the test code, no explicit
    recompilation required (this is exactly what LispUnit and FReT do).
