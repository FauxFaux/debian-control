Description: Common Lisp library that provides a socket level postgresql interface
 Pg is a socket-level interface to the PostgreSQL object-relational
 Database. The Library implements the client part of the frontend/backend
 protocol, so does not require interfacing with the libpq library. SQL
 types are converted to the equivalent Common Lisp types where possible.
 Supports large objects (BLOBs).
