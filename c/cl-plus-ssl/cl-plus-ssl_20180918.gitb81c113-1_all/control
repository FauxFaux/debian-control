Description: Common Lisp interface to OpenSSL
 CL+SSL is portable code based on CFFI and gray streams. It defines its own
 libssl BIO method, so that SSL I/O can be written over portable Lisp
 streams instead of bypassing the streams and sending data over Unix file
 descriptors directly. (But the traditional approach is still used if
 possible.)
