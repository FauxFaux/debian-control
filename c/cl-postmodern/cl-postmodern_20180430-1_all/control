Description: Common Lisp library for interacting with PostgreSQL databases
 Features efficient communication with the database server without need for
 foreign libraries, support for UTF-8 on Unicode-aware Lisp implementations,
 a syntax for mixing SQL and Lisp code, convenient support for prepared
 statements and stored procedures, a metaclass for simple database-access
 objects
 .
 The biggest differences between this library and CLSQL/CommonSQL are that
 Postmodern has no intention of being portable across different SQL
 implementations (it embraces non-standard Postgres features), and
 approaches extensions like lispy SQL and database access objects in a quite
 different way. This library was written because the CLSQL approach did not
 really work for me, your mileage may vary.
