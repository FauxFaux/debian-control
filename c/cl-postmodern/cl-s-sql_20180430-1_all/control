Description: lispy syntax for SQL queries
 S-SQL provides a lispy syntax for SQL queries, and knows how to convert
 various lisp types to their textual SQL representation. It takes care to do
 as much of the work as possible at compile-time, so that at runtime a
 string concatenation is all that is needed to produce the final SQL query.
