Description: Common Lisp types for dates, timestamps, and intervals
 Simple-date provides types (CLOS classes) for dates, timestamps, and
 intervals similar to the ones SQL databases use, in order to be able to
 store and read these to and from a database in a straighforward way. A few
 obvious operations are defined on these types.
 .
 The most glaring defect of this library is its ignorance of time zones. It
 pretends the whole world lives in UTC. Use with care.
 .
 When this library is loaded after CL-postgres, it will register suitable SQL
 readers and writers for the associated database types.
