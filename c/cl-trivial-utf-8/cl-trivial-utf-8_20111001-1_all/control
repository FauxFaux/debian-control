Description: small Common Lisp library for doing UTF-8-based in- and output
 Trivial UTF-8 is a small library for doing UTF-8-based in- and output on a
 Lisp implementation that already supports Unicode -- meaning char-code and
 code-char deal with Unicode character codes.
 .
 The rationale for the existence of this library is that while
 Unicode-enabled implementations usually do provide some kind of interface
 to dealing with character encodings, these are typically not terribly
 flexible or uniform.
 .
 The Babel library solves a similar problem while understanding more
 encodings. Trivial UTF-8 was written before Babel existed, but for new
 projects you might be better off going with Babel. The one plus that
 Trivial UTF-8 has is that it doesn't depend on any other libraries.
