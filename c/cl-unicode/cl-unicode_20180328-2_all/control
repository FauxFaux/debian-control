Description: portable Unicode library for Common Lisp
 CL-UNICODE is a library which provides Common Lisp implementations with
 knowledge about Unicode characters including their name, their general
 category, the scripts and blocks they belong to, their numerical value, and
 several other properties. It also provides the ability to replace the
 standard syntax for reading Lisp characters with one that is Unicode-aware
 and is used to enhance CL-PPCRE with Unicode properties.
 .
 CL-UNICODE is based on Unicode 5.1.
