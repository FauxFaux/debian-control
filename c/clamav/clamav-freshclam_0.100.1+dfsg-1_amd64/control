Description: anti-virus utility for Unix - virus database update utility
 Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for Unix. The main purpose of
 this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
 scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable
 multi-threaded daemon in the clamav-daemon package, a command-line
 scanner in the clamav package, and a tool for automatic updating via
 the Internet in the clamav-freshclam package. The programs are based
 on libclamav, which can be used by other software.
 .
 This package contains the freshclam program and scripts to automate virus
 database updating. It relies on an Internet connection, but can be
 run in a variety of ways to compensate for intermittent connections.
