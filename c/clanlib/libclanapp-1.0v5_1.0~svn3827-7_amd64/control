Description: ClanLib game SDK runtime
 ClanLib is a multi-platform software development kit, with an emphasis on
 game development.
 .
 On one side, it tries to provide a platform independent interface to
 write games with, by taking over the low-level work from the game and
 providing wrappers around toolkits such as DirectFB, DirectX, OpenGL,
 Vorbis, X11, etc., so that if a game is written with ClanLib, the game
 should compile on any platform supported by ClanLib without changing
 its source code.
 .
 On the other hand, ClanLib also tries to be a service-minded SDK.
 In other words, the developers have put great effort into designing
 the API, to ensure ClanLib's ease of use - while maintaining its power.
 .
 This is the runtime part of the ClanLib SDK, needed to run applications
 built with it.
