Description: SDL module for ClanLib game SDK
 ClanLib delivers a platform independent interface to write games with.
 If a game is written with ClanLib, it should be possible to compile the
 game under any platform (supported by ClanLib, that is) without changing
 the application source code.
 .
 But ClanLib is not just a wrapper library, providing a common interface
 to low-level libraries such as DirectFB, DirectX, OpenGL, X11, etc. While
 platform independence is ClanLib's primary goal, it also tries to be a
 service-minded game SDK. In other words, great effort has been put into
 designing the API, to ensure ClanLib's ease of use - while maintaining its
 power.
 .
 This package contains the SDL module (clanSDL).
