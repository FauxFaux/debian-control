Description: Analysing tool for Java dependencies - documentation
 Classycle's Analyser analyses the static class and package dependencies
 in Java applications or libraries. It is especially helpful for finding cyclic
 dependencies between classes or packages.
 .
 Classycle is similar to JDepend which does also a dependency analysis
 but only on the package level.
 .
 Classycle's Dependency Checker searches for unwanted class dependencies
 described in a dependency definition file. Dependency checking helps to
 monitor whether certain architectural constrains (e.g. in a layered
 architecture) are fulfilled or not.
 .
 This package contains Javadoc API for libspock-java.
