Description: Configuration tweaker for Claws Mail
 Clawsker is an applet to edit the so called Claws Mail hidden preferences.
 .
 Claws Mail is a fast, lightweight and feature-rich MUA with a high number
 of configurable options. To keep the binary small and fast some of these
 preferences which not widely used are not provided with a graphical
 interface for inspection and/or modification.
 .
 Users wanting to edit such preferences had to face raw edition of their
 configuration files, now you can do it with a convenient GTK+2 interface
 using Clawsker.
