Description: Compiler for the INTERCAL language
 This package provides a Perl-based compiler for the INTERCAL
 programming language, usable either from the command line or as a
 Perl module.
 .
 CLC-INTERCAL is designed to be almost compatible with the original
 (Princeton 1972) compiler.  It also implements several extensions to
 the original language, including support for object orientation,
 operator overloading and quantum computing.
