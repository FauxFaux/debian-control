Description: CLIPS shared libraries
 CLIPS is an OPS-like forward chaining production system written
 in ANSI C by NASA. The CLIPS inference engine includes truth maintenance,
 dynamic rule addition, and customizable conflict resolution strategies.
 .
 CLIPS, including the runtime version, is easily embeddable in other
 applications.  CLIPS includes an object-oriented language called COOL
 (CLIPS Object-Oriented Language) which is directly integrated with the
 inference engine.
 .
 This package installs the static libraries and headers.
