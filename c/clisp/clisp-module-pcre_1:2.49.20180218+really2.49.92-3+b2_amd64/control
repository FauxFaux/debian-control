Description: GNU CLISP module that adds libpcre support
 GNU CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation.
 It conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard, and offers many extensions.
 It runs on all desktop operating systems (GNU and Unix systems, macOS,
 Windows) and is particularly memory-efficient.
 .
 This adds a module to CLISP that implements an interface to the
 libpcre which implements Perl-compatible regular expressions.
