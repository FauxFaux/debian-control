Description: GNU CLISP module that adds zlib support for vectors
 GNU CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation.
 It conforms to the ANSI Common Lisp standard, and offers many extensions.
 It runs on all desktop operating systems (GNU and Unix systems, macOS,
 Windows) and is particularly memory-efficient.
 .
 This adds a module to CLISP that implements a zlib interface,
 allowing you to compress vectors using zlib.
