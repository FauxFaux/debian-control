Description: Compute Archimedes' constant Pi to arbitrary precision
 This program computes Archimedes' constant Pi to arbitrary precision.
 It is extremely fast and the precision is only limited by your machine's
 main memory.
 .
 This is a teaser for the CLN library, to which the actual computation is
 delegated.  You may use these decimal digits as random digits or search
 them for hidden messages.  :-)
