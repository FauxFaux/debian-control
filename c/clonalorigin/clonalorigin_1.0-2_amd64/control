Description: inference of homologous recombination in bacteria using whole genome sequences
 Bacteria, unlike us, can reproduce on their own. They do however have
 mechanisms that transfer DNA between organisms, a process more formally
 known as recombination. The mechanisms by which recombination takes
 place have been studied extensively in the laboratory but much remains
 to be understood concerning how, when and where recombination takes
 place within natural populations of bacteria and how it helps them to
 adapt to new environments. ClonalOrigin performs a comparative analysis
 of the sequences of a sample of bacterial genomes in order to
 reconstruct the recombination events that have taken place in their
 ancestry.
