Description: JavaScript optimizing compiler
 Closure Compiler is a JavaScript optimizing compiler. It parses your

 what's left. It also checks syntax, variable references, and types, and
 warns about common JavaScript pitfalls. It is used in many of Google's
 JavaScript apps, including Gmail, Google Web Search, Google Maps, and
 Google Docs.
 .
 This package contains the /usr/bin wrapper script and manpage.
