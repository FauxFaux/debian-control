Description: initialization system for infrastructure cloud instances
 Cloud-init provides a framework and tool to configure and customize virtual
 machine instances for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds platforms. It
 can for example set a default locale and hostname, generate SSH private host
 keys, install SSH public keys for logging into a default account, set up
 ephemeral mount points, and run user-provided scripts.
 .
 Various methods are supported for passing data to the instance at launch
 time, including the standard interfaces of multiple platforms.
