Description: 3D point cloud and mesh processing software
 This is a 3D point cloud (and triangular mesh) processing software. It has
 been originally designed to perform comparison between two 3D points clouds
 (such as the ones obtained with a laser scanner) or between a point cloud
 and a triangular mesh.
 .
 It relies on a specific octree structure that enables great performances in
 this particular function. It was also meant to deal with huge point clouds
 (typically more than 10 millions points, and up to 120 millions with 2 GB
 of memory)
