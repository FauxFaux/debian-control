Description: OpenStack Rating as a Service - processor
 CloudKitty aims at filling the gap between metrics collection systems like
 ceilometer and a billing system.
 .
 Every metrics are collected, aggregated and processed through different rating
 modules. You can then query CloudKitty's storage to retrieve processed data
 and easily generate reports.
 .
 Most parts of CloudKitty are modular so you can easily extend the base code to
 address your particular use case.
 .
 This package contains the Cloudkitty processor daemon.
