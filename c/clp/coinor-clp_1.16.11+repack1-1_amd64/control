Description: Coin-or linear programming solver
 Clp (Coin-or linear programming) is an open-source linear programming solver
 written in C++. It is primarily meant to be used as a callable library, but a
 basic, stand-alone executable version is also available. It is designed to
 find solutions of constrained linear mathematical optimization problems.
 .
 This package contains the clp executable.
