Description: library for full-featured text search engine (development)
 CLucene is a C++ port of the popular Apache Lucene search engine
 (http://lucene.apache.org/java). It is released under LGPL or the Apache
 License.
 .
 CLucene aims to be a high-speed alternative to Java Lucene, its API is very
 similar to that of the Java version. CLucene has recently been brought up to
 date with Lucene 1.4.3. It contains most of the same functionality as the
 Java version, except for Socket, Threading and the special caching
 modifications.
 .
 This package contains the static libraries and headers for developing
 applications that use the CLucene search API.
