Description: cream/brown/orange color theme for Emacs
 Clues was initially based on a Visual Studio theme called 'Blues 'n
 Roots', however it's a long way from looking much like it, aside from
 the occasional color accent, Blues (despite its name) has a more
 toasted caramel flavor. Clues on the other hand is made up of cooling
 colors with a couple of flecks of light cream/brown/orange to break
 up any monotony, with yellow/gold rainbow-delimiters.
