Description: Multiple alignment of nucleic acid and protein sequences (graphical interface)
 This package offers a GUI interface for the Clustal multiple sequence
 alignment program. It provides an integrated environment for performing
 multiple sequence- and profile-alignments to analyse the results.
 The sequence alignment is displayed in a window on the screen.
 A versatile coloring scheme has been incorporated to highlight conserved
 features in the alignment. For professional presentations, one should
 use the texshade LaTeX package or boxshade.
 .
 The pull-down menus at the top of the window allow you to select all the
 options required for traditional multiple sequence and profile alignment.
 You can cut-and-paste sequences to change the order of the alignment; you can
 select a subset of sequences to be aligned; you can select a sub-range of the
 alignment to be realigned and inserted back into the original alignment.
 .
 An alignment quality analysis can be performed and low-scoring segments or
 exceptional residues can be highlighted.
