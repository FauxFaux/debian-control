Description: curses based user interface for CMake (ccmake)
 CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple
 platform and compiler independent configuration files. CMake generates native
 makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your
 choice.
 .
 This package provides the CMake curses interface. Project configuration
 settings may be specified interactively through this GUI. Brief instructions
 are provided at the bottom of the terminal when the program is running. The
 main executable file for this GUI is "ccmake".
