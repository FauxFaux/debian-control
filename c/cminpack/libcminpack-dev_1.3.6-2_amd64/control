Description: Nonlinear equations and nonlinear least squares problems - development
 Minpack includes software for solving nonlinear equations and nonlinear least
 squares problems. Five algorithmic paths each include a core subroutine and an
 easy-to-use driver. The algorithms proceed either from an analytic
 specification of the Jacobian matrix or directly from the problem functions.
 The paths include facilities for systems of equations with a banded Jacobian
 matrix, for least squares problems with a large amount of data, and for
 checking the consistency of the Jacobian matrix with the functions.
 .
 This is the C re-write of the original fortran minpack implementation.
 .
 This package contains development files needed to build cminpack applications.
