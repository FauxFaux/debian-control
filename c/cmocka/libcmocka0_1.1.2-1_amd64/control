Description: library for the CMocka unit testing framework
 This is the major library for CMocka.
 .
 The idea of CMocka is that a test application only requires the
 standard C library and the CMocka library itself to minimize conflicts
 with standard C headers especially on a lot of different platforms.
 .
 Features:
  * Easy to use framework to write unit tests
  * Support for mock objects
  * Testing of memory leaks, buffer overflows and underflows
  * Platform and compiler independent
