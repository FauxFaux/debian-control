Description: Climate Model Output Rewriter library
 The "Climate Model Output Rewriter" (CMOR, pronounced "Seymour")
 comprises a set of C-based functions, with bindings to both Python
 and FORTRAN 90, that can be used to produce CF-compliant netCDF files
 that fulfill the requirements of many of the climate community's
 standard model experiments. These experiments are collectively
 referred to as MIP's and include, for example, AMIP, CMIP, CFMIP,
 PMIP, APE, and IPCC scenario runs. The output resulting from CMOR
 is "self-describing" and facilitates analysis of results across models.
