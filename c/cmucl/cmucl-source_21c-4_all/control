Description: CMUCL lisp sources
 These are the CMUCL sources, provided so that the
 debugger can show useful source information at appropriate
 times.
 .
 This version includes common-lisp-controller compatible
 replacements for defsystem, graystream, clx and hemlock.
 .
 defsystem provides a "make" type system for Lisp. This is
 a patched version from clocc.
 .
 Gray streams are the usual Lisp streams, but re-implemented
 as a Object hierarchy. Users can subclass existing classes and
 adapt them for their own needs.
 .
 cmucl-clx is the clx library adapted for CMUCL. clx is an
 interface to X11, just like xlib.
 .
 Hemlock is an emacs clone for CMUCL.
 .
 Note that this version only works in X, the tty interface
 is broken: the system can't parse /etc/termcap.
 .
 To open the editor, type "(ed)".
 .
 Note that to recompile CMUCL you need a working CMUCL system :-(
