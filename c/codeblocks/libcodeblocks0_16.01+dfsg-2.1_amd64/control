Description: Code::Blocks shared library
 Code::Blocks is a cross-platform Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
 It is based on a self-developed plugin framework allowing unlimited
 extensibility. Most of its functionality is already provided by plugins.
 Plugins included in the base package are:
    * Compiler frontend to many free compilers
    * Debugger frontend for GDB
    * Source formatter (based on AStyle)
    * Wizard to create new C++ classes
    * Code-completion / symbols-browser (work in progress)
    * Default MIME handler
    * Wizard to create new Code::Blocks plugins
    * To-do list
    * Extensible wizard based on scripts
    * Autosave (saves your work in the unfortunate case of a crash)
 .
 This package contains the Code::Blocks shared library.
