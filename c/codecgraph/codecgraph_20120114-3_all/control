Description: Generates graphviz graphs from HDA-Intel codec information
 Codecgraph is a tool to generate a graph based on the ALSA description
 of a High Definition Audio codec. The generated graph depicts the HDA
 codec layout and node connections, helping driver troubleshooting and
 maintenance. Codecgraph's parser reads the codec description from
 /proc/asound/card*/codec#0 and parsed data is sent to Graphviz for
 actual graph generation.
