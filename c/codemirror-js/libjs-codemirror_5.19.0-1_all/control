Description: JavaScript editor interface for code-like content
 CodeMirror is a JavaScript library that can be used to create a relatively
 pleasant editor interface for code-like content -- computer programs, HTML
 markup, and similar.
 If a mode has been written for the language you are editing, the code will
 be coloured, and the editor will optionally help you with indentation.
