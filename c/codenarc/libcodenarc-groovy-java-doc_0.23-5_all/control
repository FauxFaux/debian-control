Description: Documentation for libcodenarc-groovy-java
 Documentation for CodeNarc that is a static analysis tool
 for Groovy source code, enabling monitoring and enforcement
 of many coding standards and best practices. CodeNarc applies
 a set of Rules (predefined and/or custom) that are applied
 to each Groovy file, and generates an HTML report of the
 results, including a list of rules violated for each source
 file, and a count of the number of violations per package
 and for the whole project.
 .
 CodeNarc is similar to popular static analysis tools such as
 PMD or Checkstyle, but is targeted at Groovy source code
 instead of Java.
