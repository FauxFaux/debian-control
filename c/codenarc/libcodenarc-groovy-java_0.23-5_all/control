Description: Groovy library that provides static analysis features for Groovy code
 CodeNarc is a static analysis tool for Groovy source code,
 enabling monitoring and enforcement of many coding standards
 and best practices. CodeNarc applies a set of Rules
 (predefined and/or custom) that are applied to each Groovy
 file, and generates an HTML report of the results, including
 a list of rules violated for each source file, and a count
 of the number of violations per package and for the whole
 project.
 .
 CodeNarc is similar to popular static analysis tools such as
 PMD or Checkstyle, but is targeted at Groovy source code
 instead of Java.
