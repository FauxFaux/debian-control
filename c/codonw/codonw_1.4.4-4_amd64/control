Description: Correspondence Analysis of Codon Usage
 CodonW is a package for codon usage analysis. It was designed to simplify
 Multivariate Analysis (MVA) of codon usage. The MVA method employed in
 CodonW is correspondence analysis (COA) (the most popular MVA method for
 codon usage analysis). CodonW can generate a COA for codon usage, relative
 synonymous codon usage or amino acid usage. Additional analyses of codon
 usage include investigation of optimal codons, codon and dinucleotide bias,
 and/or base composition. CodonW analyses sequences encoded by genetic codes
 other than the universal code.
