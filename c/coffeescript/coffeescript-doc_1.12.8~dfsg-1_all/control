Description: documentation for the CoffeeScript language
 CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.
 Underneath all of those embarrassing braces and semicolons, JavaScript
 has always had a gorgeous object model at its heart. CoffeeScript is an
 attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.
 .
 The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: "It's just JavaScript". The code
 compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no
 interpretation at runtime. You can use any existing JavaScript library
 seamlessly (and vice-versa). The compiled output is readable and
 pretty-printed, passes through JavaScript Lint without warnings, will
 work in every JavaScript implementation, and tends to run as fast or
 faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.
 .
 This package contains documentation.
