Description: Java API for annotating code with contracts
 Contracts for Java is a contract programming framework for Java, which
 uses annotation processing and bytecode instrumentation to provide
 run-time checking.
 .
 Contracts for Java enables you to annotate your code with contracts
 in the form of preconditions, postconditions and invariants.
 .
 These contract annotations are:
  - easy to write and read
  - checked at runtime
 Annotating code with contracts helps you:
  * design,
  * document,
  * test, and
  * debug
 programs.
