Description: sheaf cohomology of line bundles on toric varieties
 The algorithm for the computation of sheaf cohomologies for line bundles on
 toric varieties presented in "Cohomology of Line Bundles: A Computational
 Algorithm" by Ralph Blumenhagen, Benjamin Jurke, Thorsten Rahn, and Helmut
 Roschy has been implemented in a convenient and high-performance C/C++
 application called cohomCalg.
 .
 The optional cohomCalg Koszul extension serves as a Mathematica 7 frontend and
 allows for the easy computation of hypersurface and complete intersection
 cohomologies, following the material presented in "Cohomology of Line Bundles:
 Applications" by the same authors.
