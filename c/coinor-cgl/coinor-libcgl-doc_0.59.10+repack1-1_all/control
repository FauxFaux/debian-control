 The Cut Generation Library (Cgl) is an open collection of cutting plane
 implementations ("cut generators") for use in teaching, research, and
 applications.
 .
 Cgl is part of the larger COIN-OR initiative (Computational Infrastructure
 for Operations Research) and can be used with other COIN-OR packages that
 make use of cuts, such as the mixed-integer linear programming solver Cbc.
 .
 This package contains the documentation and examples.
