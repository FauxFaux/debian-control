Description: A software package for semidefinite programming
 CSDP is a library of routines that implements a predictor corrector variant of
 the semidefinite programming algorithm of Helmberg, Rendl, Vanderbei, and
 Wolkowicz. The code runs in parallel on shared memory multi-processor systems,
 and it makes effective use of sparsity in the constraint matrices.
 .
 CSDP is part of the larger COIN-OR initiative (Computational Infrastructure
 for Operations Research).
 .
 This package contains the debug symbols.
