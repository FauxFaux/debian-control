Description: Linear programming solver using of the dynamic simplex algorithm
 DyLp is designed to find solutions of constrained linear mathematical
 optimization problems. To this end, it is using a full implementation of the
 so called dynamic simplex algorithm for linear programming.
 .
 DyLP is part of the larger COIN-OR initiative (Computational Infrastructure
 for Operations Research) and integrates well in the COIN Open Solver
 Interface (OSI), OsiDylp, which takes advantage of capabilities provided by
 COIN (e.g., enhanced input/output and constraint system preprocessing) and is
 recommended if you're working in a C++ environment.
 .
 This package contains the debug symbols.
