Description: Formulation of Linear Optimization Problems in C++
 An open source algebraic modelling language implemented as a C++ class
 library.  Using FLOPC++, linear optimization models can be specified in
 a declarative style, similar to algebraic modelling languages such as
 GAMS and AMPL, within a C++ program. As a result the traditional strengths of
 algebraic modelling languages are preserved, while embedding linear
 optimization models in software applications is facilitated.
 .
 Coinor-flopc++ is part of the larger COIN-OR initiative
 (Computational Infrastructure for Operations Research).
 .
 This package contains the binaries and libraries.
