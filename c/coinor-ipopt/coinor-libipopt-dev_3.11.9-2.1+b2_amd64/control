Description: Interior-Point Optimizer - header files
 Ipopt is an open-source solver for large-scale nonlinear continuous
 optimization. It can be used from modeling environments, such as AMPL,
 GAMS, or Matlab, and it is also available as a callable library with
 interfaces to C++, C, and Fortran. Ipopt uses an interior point method,
 together with a filter linear search procedure. Ipopt is part of the
 larger COIN-OR initiative (Computational Infrastructure for Operations
 Research).
 .
 The Debian package is compiled against MUMPS (as it is the only one of
 the available solvers that is Free Software and included in Debian).
 .
 This package contains the header files for developers.
