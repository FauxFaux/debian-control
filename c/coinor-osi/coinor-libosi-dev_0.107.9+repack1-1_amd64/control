Description: COIN-OR Open Solver Interface (developer files)
 Osi (Open Solver Interface) provides an abstract C++ base class to a generic
 linear programming (LP) solver, along with derived classes for specific
 solvers. Many applications may be able to use the Osi to insulate themselves
 from a specific LP solver.
 .
 Osi is part of the larger COIN-OR initiative (Computational Infrastructure
 for Operations Research).
 .
 This package contains the header files for developers.
