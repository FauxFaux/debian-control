Description: COIN-OR solver for mixed-integer linear programs (documentation)
 SYMPHONY is an open-source generic mixed-integer linear programs (MILP) solver,
 callable library, and extensible framework for implementing customized solvers
 SYMPHONY has a number of advanced capabilities, including the ability to
 solve multi-objective MILPs, the ability to warm start its solution procedure,
 and the ability to perform basic sensitivity analyses.
 .
 SYMPHONY is part of the larger COIN-OR initiative (Computational Infrastructure
 for Operations Research).
 .
 This package contains the documentation and examples.
