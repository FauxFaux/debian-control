Description: computes the co-installability kernel of a deb or RPM repository
 This package is useful when you are interested in analyzing
 co-installability of packages in a large package repository.  A set
 of packages is called co-installable if it can be extended to a set
 that satisfies all inter-package relations (dependencies, conflicts,
 etc.).
 .
 This tool reduces a repository to a much smaller one, its so-called
 co-installability  kernel, that behaves exactly the same as far as
 co-installability of package is concerned. This is achieved by
 - dropping all relations that are not relevant for this purpose
 - identifying all packages that behave the same.
 The kernel is typically orders of magnitude smaller than the original
 repository.
