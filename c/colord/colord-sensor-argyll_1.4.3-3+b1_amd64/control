Description: system service to manage device colour profiles -- argyll sensor plugin
 colord is a system service that makes it easy to manage, install and generate
 colour profiles to accurately colour manage input and output devices.
 .
 It provides a D-Bus API for system frameworks to query, a persistent data
 store, and a mechanism for session applications to set system policy.
 .
 This package contains a sensor plugin that uses the Argyll tools, allowing
 colord to support colourimeters that are supported by Argyll.
