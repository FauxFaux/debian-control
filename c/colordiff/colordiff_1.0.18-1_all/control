Description: tool to colorize 'diff' output
 ColorDiff is a wrapper for the 'diff' command. It produces
 the same output as diff, but with colored highlighting to improve
 readability. The color schemes can be customized.
 .
 The output is similar to the syntax-highlighting mode of Vim or Emacs
 when editing a patch created by diff.
