Description: I/O redirection, signal handling, and console utilities
 com-hypirion-io-clojure provides a set of features wrapped in Java classes:
 .
  *Pipe: Establish a link between InputStream and OutputStream, also supports
   Reader and Writer.
  *SignalInterceptor: Intercept POSIX signals before they are sent to their
   signal handlers.
  *RevivableInputStream: Allow canceling blocking read calls to streams
   without closing them.
  *ConsoleUtils: Set on/off echoing in the console.
 .
 Common usage of this library includes: asynchronous zipping of data from two
 data sources, redirecting output and input to subprocesses and loggers, and
 sending messages to threads.
