Description: CORBA scripting with Tcl
 Combat is a CORBA Object Request Broker that allows the
 implementation of CORBA clients and servers in the Tcl programming
 language.
 .
 On the client side, Combat is not only useful to easily test-drive
 existing CORBA servers, including the ability for rapid prototyping
 or to interactively interface with servers from a console, but makes
 Tcl an exciting language for distributed programming. Also, Tk allows
 to quickly develop attractive user interfaces accessing CORBA
 services. Server-side scripting using [incr Tcl] classes also offers
 a wide range of possibilities.
 .
 Combat is compatible with the CORBA 3.0 specification including the
 IIOP protocol, and has been tested to interoperate with a wide range
 of open-source and commercial ORBs, including MICO, TAO and
 ORBexpress.
 .
 Combat is written in pure Tcl, allowing it to run on all platforms
 supported by Tcl, which is a much wider range than supported by any
 other ORB.
