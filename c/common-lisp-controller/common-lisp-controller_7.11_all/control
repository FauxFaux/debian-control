Description: Common Lisp source and compiler manager
 This package helps installing Common Lisp sources and compilers.
 .
 It creates a user-specific cache of compiled objects. When a library
 or an implementation is upgraded, all compiled objects in the cache
 are flushed. It also provides tools to recompile all libraries and to
 generate Debian packages from asdf-install packages.
 .
 Also includes clc-clbuild, a wrapper for clbuild. Please see
 http://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/ for more information.
 .
 This package also contains a wrapper to invoke emacs with a
 clbuild provided slime environment.
