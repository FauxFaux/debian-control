Description: Python parser for the CommonMark Markdown spec -- Python 3
 Pure Python port of `jgm''s CommonMark, a Markdown parser and renderer for the
 CommonMark (http://commonmark.org) specification, using only native modules.
 .
 This provides the CommonMark-py Python package as developed by Bibek Kafle and
 Roland Shoemaker (BKRS). After release 0.5.4, their project moved to `Read the
 Docs' (http://readthedocs.org) and major changes broke compatibility. However
 some Python packages may still depend on their last implementation, hence this
 Debian package which is meant to smooth the transition.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
