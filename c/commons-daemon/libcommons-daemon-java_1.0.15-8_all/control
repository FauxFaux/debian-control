Description: Library to launch Java applications as daemons
 The Daemon package from Apache Commons can be used to implement Java
 applications which can be launched as daemons. For example the
 program will be notified about a shutdown so that it can perform
 cleanup tasks before its process of execution is destroyed by the
 operation system.
 .
 This package contains the java library. You will also need the actual
 binary for your architecture which is provided by the jsvc package.
