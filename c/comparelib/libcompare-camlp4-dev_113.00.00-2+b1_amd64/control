Description: OCaml syntax extension for deriving "compare" functions automatically
 Pa_compare is a camlp4 syntax extension that derives comparison
 functions from type representations.
 .
 The scaffolded functions are usually much faster than OCaml's
 Pervasives.compare. Scaffolding functions also gives you more
 flexibilty by allowing you to override them for a specific type and
 more safety by making sure that you only compare comparable values.
