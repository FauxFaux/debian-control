Description: use standard color blending functions in Sass
 CSS doesn't natively support color blending the way that GIMP does.
 SCSS Blend Modes attempts to fake that by allowing you to blend a
 foreground color with a background color in order to approximate color
 blending.  The process is not dynamic; you can't use it to blend a
 color with an image.
 .
 Sass makes CSS fun again. Sass is an extension of CSS3, adding nested
 rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more.
