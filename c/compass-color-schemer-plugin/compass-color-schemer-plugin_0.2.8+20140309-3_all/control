Description: create color schemes with ease
 Color schemer is a robust color toolset for Sass. It expands on the
 existing Sass color functions and adds things like RYB manipulation,
 set-hue, set-lightness, tint, shade and more. It also leverages these
 tools adding a full-featured color scheming tool that allows you to set
 one primary color and create whole color schemes around it.
 .
 Sass makes CSS fun again. Sass is an extension of CSS3, adding nested
 rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more.
