Description: tool for analyzing the complexity of C program functions
 Complexity measurement tool help to:
 .
  * locate suspicious areas in unfamiliar code
  * get an idea of how much effort may be required to understand that
    code
  * get an idea of the effort required to test a code base
  * provide a reminder to yourself. You may see what you've written
     as obvious, but others may not.
 .
 Comparing with existing tool McCabe, this program improves scoring
 of following language constructs:
 .
  * code length
  * switch statement
  * logic conditions
