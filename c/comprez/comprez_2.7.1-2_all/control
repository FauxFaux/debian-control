Description: frontend to many compression programs
 Comprez, aka 'z', is a simple, safe and convenient front-end for the
 compress(1), uncompress(1), gzip(1), bzip2(1), tar(1), zip(1) and
 unzip(1) utilities for compressing and uncompressing files and
 directories.
 .
 The basic idea is that you can just run "comprez SOMETHING" where
 SOMETHING is any file, directory, compressed file or compressed
 archive, and program will do the right thing in a standard way.
 Simple for novices and convenient for experts.
