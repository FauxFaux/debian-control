Description: predictor of protein ligand binding sites from structure and conservation
 ConCavity predicts protein ligand binding sites by combining evolutionary
 sequence conservation and 3D structure.
 .
 ConCavity takes as input a PDB format protein structure and optionally
 files that characterize the evolutionary sequence conservation of the chains
 in the structure file.
 .
 The following result files are produced by default:
  * Residue ligand binding predictions for each chain (*.scores).
  * Residue ligand binding predictions in a PDB format file (residue
    scores placed in the temp. factor field, *_residue.pdb).
  * Pocket prediction locations in a DX format file (*.dx).
  * PyMOL script to visualize the predictions (*.pml).
