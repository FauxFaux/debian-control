Description: HTCondor classads expression language - development library
 Classified Advertisements (classads) are the lingua franca of HTCondor, used
 for describing jobs, workstations, and other resources. There is a protocol
 for evaluating whether two classads match, which is used by the HTCondor
 central manager to determine the compatibility of jobs, and workstations where
 they may be run.
 .
 This package provides the static library and header files.
