Description: HTCondor classads expression language - runtime library
 Classified Advertisements (classads) are the lingua franca of HTCondor, used
 for describing jobs, workstations, and other resources. There is a protocol
 for evaluating whether two classads match, which is used by the HTCondor
 central manager to determine the compatibility of jobs, and workstations where
 they may be run.
 .
 This package provides the runtime library.
