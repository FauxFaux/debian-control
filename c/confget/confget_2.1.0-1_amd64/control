Description: read variables from INI-style configuration files
 The confget utility examines a INI-style configuration file and retrieves
 the value of the specified variables from the specified section.
 Its intended use is to let shell scripts use the same INI-style
 configuration files as other programs, to avoid duplication of data.
 .
 The confget utility may retrieve the values of one or more variables,
 list all the variables in a specified section, list only those whose names
 or values match a specified pattern (shell glob or regular expression), or
 check if a variable is present in the file at all.  It has a "shell-quoting"
 output mode that quotes the variable values in a way suitable for passing
 them directly to a Bourne-style shell.
