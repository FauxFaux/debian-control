Description: spawn external processes in Conkeror
 This helper tool named conkeror-spawn-helper is necessary to let the
 Conkeror web browser spawn external process, e.g. to edit form fields
 in an external program. It was previously named spawn-process-helper.
 .
 Maybe helpful for other Gecko-based applications, too.
