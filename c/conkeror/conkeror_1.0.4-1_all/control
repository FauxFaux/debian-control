Description: keyboard focused web browser with Emacs look and feel
 Conkeror is a highly-programmable web browser based on Mozilla's
 rendering engine Gecko which is the base of all Mozilla products
 including Firefox. Conkeror has a sophisticated keyboard system for
 running commands and interacting with web page content, modelled
 after Emacs and Lynx. It is self-documenting and extensible with
 JavaScript.
 .
 It comes with builtin support for several Web 2.0 sites like several
 Google services (Search, Gmail, Maps, Reader, etc.), Del.icio.us,
 Reddit, Last.fm and YouTube. For easier editing of form fields, it
 can spawn external editors. For this feature the recommended
 conkeror-spawn-process-helper package needs to be installed.
 .
 Despite its very similar sounding name, Conkeror is not related to
 the KDE web browser and file manager Konqueror in any way.
