Description: highly configurable system monitor (transitional package)
 Conky is a system monitor that can display just about anything,
 either on your root desktop or in its own window.
 Conky has many built-in objects, as well as the ability to execute
 external programs or scripts (either external or through built-in
 Lua support).
 .
 This is a dummy package to ease transition to the new packaging scheme.
 It may be safely removed after upgrade/installation.
