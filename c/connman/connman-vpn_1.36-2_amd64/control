Description: Intel Connection Manager daemon - VPN daemon
 The Linux Connection Manager project provides a daemon for managing
 Internet connections within embedded devices running the Linux
 operating system. The Connection Manager is designed to be slim and to
 use as few resources as possible. It is fully modular system that
 can be extended through plug-ins. The plug-in approach allows for
 easy adaption and modification for various use cases.
 .
 ConnMan provies IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity via:
  * ethernet
  * WiFi, using wpasupplicant
  * Cellular, using oFono
  * Bluetooth, using bluez
 .
 ConnMan implements DNS resolving and caching, DHCP clients for both IPv4 and
 IPv6, link-local IPv4 address handling and tethering (IP connection sharing)
 to clients via USB, ethernet, WiFi, cellular and Bluetooth.
 .
 This package contains the connman VPN daemon. ConnMan VPN daemon manages
 VPNs on behalf of connmand and start and stops various VPN client
 applications. The VPN daemon can also be run standalone without connmand.
