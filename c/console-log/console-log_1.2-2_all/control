Description: Puts logfile pagers on virtual consoles
 console-log keeps logfile pagers open on virtual consoles. The
 default configuration puts exim's mainlog on tty8, and the syslog on
 tty9, in a less process. It can also make sure that this console is visible
 automatically after system boot so that a crashed system at least
 leaves the syslog readable on the console before reset. Using a pager
 makes searching, tagging and highlighting possible.
