Description: console font and keymap setup program - reduced version for Linux
 This package provides the console with the same keyboard
 configuration scheme as the X Window System. As a result, there is no
 need to duplicate or change the keyboard files just to make simple
 customizations such as the use of dead keys, the key functioning as
 AltGr or Compose key, the key(s) to switch between Latin and
 non-Latin mode, etc.
 .
 This package can be useful for handhelds or other devices with small
 storage space.
