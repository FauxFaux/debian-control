Description: legacy fork of declarative binary data parser/builder (Python 2)
 Construct is a Python library for parsing and building of data
 structures (binary or textual).
 .
 It is based on the concept of defining data structures in a declarative
 manner, rather than procedural code: more complex constructs are composed of
 a hierarchy of simpler ones. It's the first library that makes parsing
 fun, instead of the usual headache it is today.
 .
 This is a legacy fork of the original construct 2.5.3 repackaged for
 compatibility purposes.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 2.
