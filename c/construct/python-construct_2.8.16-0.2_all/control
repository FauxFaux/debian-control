Description: powerful declarative parser (and builder) for binary data
 Construct is a python library for parsing and building of data structures
 (binary or textual).
 .
 It is based on the concept of defining data structures in a declarative
 manner, rather than procedural code: more complex constructs are composed of
 a hierarchy of simpler ones. It's the first library that makes parsing
 fun, instead of the usual headache it is today.
