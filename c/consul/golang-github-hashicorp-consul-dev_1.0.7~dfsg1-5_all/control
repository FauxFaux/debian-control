Description: tool for service discovery, monitoring and configuration (source)
 Consul is a tool for service discovery and configuration. Consul is
 distributed, highly available, and extremely scalable.
 .
 Consul provides several key features:
 .
  - Service Discovery - Consul makes it simple for services to register
    themselves and to discover other services via a DNS or HTTP interface.
    External services such as SaaS providers can be registered as well.
 .
  - Health Checking - Health Checking enables Consul to quickly alert operators
    about any issues in a cluster. The integration with service discovery
    prevents routing traffic to unhealthy hosts and enables service level
    circuit breakers.
 .
  - Key/Value Storage - A flexible key/value store enables storing dynamic
    configuration, feature flagging, coordination, leader election and more.
    The simple HTTP API makes it easy to use anywhere.
 .
  - Multi-Datacenter - Consul is built to be datacenter aware, and can support
    any number of regions without complex configuration.
 .
 Consul runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. It is recommended to run the
 Consul servers only on Linux, however.
 .
