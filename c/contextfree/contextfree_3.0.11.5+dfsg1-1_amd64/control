Description: image generator based on context-free grammars
 Context Free is a program that produces images based on context-free grammars.
 These grammars are sets of non-deterministic rules that determine what an
 image should look like.  The resulting images often resemble a mix of
 spirograph drawings, fractals and abstract art.
 .
 Context Free can generate images with millions of shapes, in PNG (up to 100
 megapixels) or SVG format.  It can also produce animations.  Many example
 images are included.
