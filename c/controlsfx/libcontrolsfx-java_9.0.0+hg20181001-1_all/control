Description: high quality UI controls and other tools to complement JavaFX
 ControlsFX is a collection of UI controls and other tools to complement
 the core JavaFX distribution.  It has been developed for JavaFX 8.0 and
 beyond, and has a guiding principle of only accepting new controls and
 features when all existing code is at an acceptably high level, including
 having high quality javadoc documentation.
