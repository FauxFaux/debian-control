Description: convert 8 bit character encoding in file names and text content to UTF-8
 The mixconv utility reads a mixed-encoding text file, analyzes each
 line to determine whether it is in 7-bit ASCII, an 8-bit encoding,
 UTF-8 or WTF-8, converts everything to UTF-8 and prints the result to
 standard output.
 .
 The dirconv utility scans a directory structure, analyzes each file
 and directory name to determine whether it is in 7-bit ASCII, an 8-bit
 encoding, UTF-8 or WTF-8, converts everything to UTF-8, and renames
 the files and directories accordingly.
