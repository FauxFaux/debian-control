Description: filename encoding conversion tool
 convmv can convert a single filename, a directory tree or all files
 on a filesystem to a different encoding. It only converts the
 encoding of filenames, not files contents. A special feature of
 convmv is that it also takes care of symlinks: the encoding of the
 symlink's target will be converted if the symlink itself is being
 converted.
 .
 It is also possible to convert directories to UTF-8 which are already
 partially UTF-8 encoded.
