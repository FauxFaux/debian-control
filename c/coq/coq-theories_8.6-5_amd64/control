Description: proof assistant for higher-order logic (theories)
 Coq is a proof assistant for higher-order logic, which allows the
 development of computer programs consistent with their formal
 specification. It is developed using Objective Caml and Camlp5.
 .
 This package provides existing theories that new proofs can be
 based upon, including theories of arithmetic and Boolean values.
