Description: "one-click" file sharing web application with a focus on users' privacy
 Coquelicot is a "one-click" file sharing web application with a focus
 on protecting users' privacy.
 .
 Basic principle: users can upload a file to the server, in return they
 get a unique URL which can be shared with others in order to download
 the file.
 .
 Coquelicot aims to protect, to some extent, users and system
 administrators from disclosure of the files exchanged from passive and
 not so active attackers.
 .
 Coquelicot should be installed behind a non-buffering HTTPS reverse proxy
 like Apache, nginx or pound.
