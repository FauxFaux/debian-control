Description: Open source clone of Theme Hospital (data package)
 Theme Hospital was a simulation computer game developed by Bullfrog
 Productions and published by Electronic Arts in 1997, in which the player
 designs and operates a hospital.

 The game currently requires the original graphics and tries to mimic the
 original as closely as possible. Therefore you will need a copy of the
 original game for this package to be useful.
