Description: concurrent programming library for OCaml
 This library enhances the Threads library of the standard OCaml distribution
 in two dimensions:
 .
 - It implements the same API of the standard Threads library on different
 execution engines (process, networker), so that a single copy of
 source code can be compiled and deployed to different environments
 without modification.
 - It is also a super set of the standard Threads library, with extra
 components (STM etc.), functions (spawn etc.) and features (object-level
 compatibility etc.).
 .
 This package provides static libraries, interfaces, and documentation
 for coThreads.
