Description: Courier Unicode library (development files and headers)
 This library implements several algorithms related to the Unicode
 Standard:
  - Look up uppercase, lowercase, and titlecase equivalents
    of a unicode character.
  - Implementation of grapheme and work breaking rules.
  - Implementation of line breaking rules.
  - Several ancillary functions, like looking up the unicode character
    that corresponds to some HTML 4.0 entity (such as “&amp;”, for
    example), and determining the normal width or a double-width status
    of a unicode character. Also, an adaptation of the iconv(3) API for
    this unicode library.
  - Look up Unicode script property.
 .
