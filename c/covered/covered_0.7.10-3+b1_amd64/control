Description: Verilog code coverage analysis tool
 Covered is a Verilog code coverage utility that reads in a Verilog design and
 a generated VCD/LXT dumpfile from that design and generates a coverage file
 that can be merged with other coverage files or used to create a coverage
 report. Covered also contains the GUI coverage report utility that reads in a
 coverage file to allow interactive coverage discovery. Areas of coverage
 measured by Covered are: line, toggle, memory, combinational logic, FSM
 state/state-transition and assertion coverage.
