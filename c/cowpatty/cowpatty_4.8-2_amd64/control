Description: Brute-force WPA dictionary attack
 If you are auditing WPA-PSK or WPA2-PSK networks, you can use
 this tool to identify weak passphrases that were used to generate the
 PMK.  Supply a libpcap capture file that includes the 4-way handshake, a
 dictionary file of passphrases to guess with, and the SSID for the
 network.
