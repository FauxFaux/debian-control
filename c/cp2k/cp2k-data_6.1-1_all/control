Description: Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (data files)
 CP2K is a program to perform simulations of solid state, liquid, molecular and
 biological systems. It is especially aimed at massively parallel and linear
 scaling electronic structure methods and state-of-the-art ab-inito molecular
 dynamics (AIMD) simulations.
 .
 This package contains basis sets, pseudopotentials and force-field parameters.
