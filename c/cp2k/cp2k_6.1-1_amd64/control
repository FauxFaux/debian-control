Description: Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics
 CP2K is a program to perform simulations of solid state, liquid, molecular and
 biological systems. It is especially aimed at massively parallel and linear
 scaling electronic structure methods and state-of-the-art ab-initio molecular
 dynamics (AIMD) simulations.
 .
 CP2K is optimized for the mixed Gaussian and Plane-Waves (GPW) method based on
 pseudopotentials, but is able to run all-electron or pure plane-wave/Gaussian
 calculations as well. Features include:
 .
 Ab-initio Electronic Structure Theory Methods using the QUICKSTEP module:
 .
  * Density-Functional Theory (DFT) energies and forces
  * Hartree-Fock (HF) energies and forces
  * Moeller-Plesset 2nd order perturbation theory (MP2) energies and forces
  * Random Phase Approximation (RPA) energies
  * Gas phase or Periodic boundary conditions (PBC)
  * Basis sets include various standard Gaussian-Type Orbitals (GTOs), Pseudo-
    potential plane-waves (PW), and a mixed Gaussian and (augmented) plane wave
    approach (GPW/GAPW)
  * Norm-conserving, seperable Goedecker-Teter-Hutter (GTH) and non-linear core
    corrected (NLCC) pseudopotentials, or all-electron calculations
  * Local Density Approximation (LDA) XC functionals including SVWN3, SVWN5,
    PW92 and PADE
  * Gradient-corrected (GGA) XC functionals including BLYP, BP86, PW91, PBE and
    HCTH120 as well as the meta-GGA XC functional TPSS
  * Hybrid XC functionals with exact Hartree-Fock Exchange (HFX) including
    B3LYP, PBE0 and MCY3
  * Double-hybrid XC functionals including B2PLYP and B2GPPLYP
  * Additional XC functionals via LibXC
  * Dispersion corrections via DFT-D2 and DFT-D3 pair-potential models
  * Non-local van der Waals corrections for XC functionals including B88-vdW,
    PBE-vdW and B97X-D
  * DFT+U (Hubbard) correction
  * Density-Fitting for DFT via Bloechl or Density Derived Atomic Point Charges
    (DDAPC) charges, for HFX via Auxiliary Density Matrix Methods (ADMM) and
    for MP2/RPA via Resolution-of-identity (RI)
  * Sparse matrix and prescreening techniques for linear-scaling Kohn-Sham (KS)
    matrix computation
  * Orbital Transformation (OT) or Direct Inversion of the iterative subspace
    (DIIS) self-consistent field (SCF) minimizer
  * Local Resolution-of-Identity Projector Augmented Wave method (LRIGPW)
  * Absolutely Localized Molecular Orbitals SCF (ALMO-SCF) energies for linear
    scaling of molecular systems

    (TDDFPT)
 .
 Ab-initio Molecular Dynamics:
 .
  * Born-Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics (BOMD)
  * Ehrenfest Molecular Dynamics (EMD)
  * PS extrapolation of initial wavefunction
  * Time-reversible Always Stable Predictor-Corrector (ASPC) integrator

    (Second-Generation Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics)
 .
 Mixed quantum-classical (QM/MM) simulations:
 .
  * Real-space multigrid approach for the evaluation of the Coulomb
    interactions between the QM and the MM part
  * Linear-scaling electrostatic coupling treating of periodic boundary
    conditions
  * Adaptive QM/MM
 .
 Further Features include:
 .
  * Single-point energies, geometry optimizations and frequency calculations

    for minimum energy path (MEP) calculations
  * Global optimization of geometries
  * Solvation via the Self-Consistent Continuum Solvation (SCCS) model
  * Semi-Empirical calculations including the AM1, RM1, PM3, MNDO, MNDO-d, PNNL
    and PM6 parametrizations, density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) and
    self-consistent-polarization tight-binding (SCP-TB), with or without
    periodic boundary conditions
  * Classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations in microcanonical ensemble
    (NVE) or canonical ensmble (NVT) with Nose-Hover and canonical sampling
    through velocity rescaling (CSVR) thermostats
  * Metadynamics including well-tempered Metadynamics for Free Energy
    calculations
