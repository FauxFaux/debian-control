Description: script to detect outdated CPAN modules in your environment
 cpanoutdated prints the list of outdated CPAN modules in your machine. It
 provides the same feature as 'CPAN::Shell->r', but cpan-outdated is much
 faster and uses less memory. This script can be integrated with the cpanm
 command.
