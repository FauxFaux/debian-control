Description: ESO data reduction pipeline for the FORS1/2 instruments
 FORS pipeline recipes for the reduction of data obtained with the FORS1 and
 FORS2 instruments in the LSS, MOS, MXU, PMOS, and direct imaging instrument
 modes.
 .
 FORS is the visual and near UV FOcal Reducer and low dispersion Spectrograph
 for the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Southern Observatory
 (ESO). Two versions of FORS have been built, upgraded and moved to the
 Cassegrain foci of different telescopes in the past years. In April 2009,
 FORS1 was dismounted to make room for X-shooter, so only FORS2 is in
 operation. FORS is designed as an all-dioptric instrument for the wavelength
 range from 330 nm to 1100 nm and provides an image scale of 0".25/pixel (or
 0".125/pixel with the high resolution collimator) in the standard readout
 mode (2x2 binning). FORS2 is installed on UT1 (Antu) and is by default
 equipped with a detector system that is optimised for the red with a very low
 level of fringes thanks to a mosaic of two 2k x 4k MIT CCDs (with 15 Î¼m
 pixels). However, the blue-optimised detector system that was previously
 available on FORS1 has been commissioned on FORS2 and can be requested for
 Visitor Mode observation. The geometries of both detector systems are
 similar, with the optical axis falling ~30" above the gap and offsets of a
 few arc-seconds between the two chips. FORS2 has many modes, including
 multi-object spectroscopy with exchangeable masks, long-slit spectroscopy,
 imaging and spectro-polarimetry and high-time resolution imaging and
 spectroscopy.
