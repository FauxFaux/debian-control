Description: ESO data reduction pipeline for the GIRAFFE instrument
 This is the data reduction pipeline for the GIRAFFE instrument of the
 Very Large Telescope (VLT) from the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
 .
 GIRAFFE is a medium-high resolution (R=7500-30000) spectrograph for the
 entire visible range 370-900 nm. GIRAFFE is aimed at carrying out
 intermediate and high resolution spectroscopy of galactic and extragalactic
 objects having a high spatial density. The name comes from the first design,
 where the spectrograph was standing vertically on a platform.
