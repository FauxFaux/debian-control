Description: ESO data reduction pipeline calibration data downloader for MUSE
 This package downloads calibration and other static data of the
 data reduction pipeline for the Muse instrument of the
 Very Large Telescope (VLT) from the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
 .
 MUSE, the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, is an Integral Field
 Spectrograph located at the Nasmyth B focus of Yepun, the VLT UT4
 telescope. It has a modular structure composed of 24 identical IFU modules
 that together sample, in Wide Field Mode (WFM), a near-contiguous 1 squared
 arcmin field of view. Spectrally the instrument samples almost the full
 optical domain with a mean resolution of 3000. Spatially, the instrument
 samples the sky with 0.2 arcseconds spatial pixels in the currently offered
 Wide Field Mode with natural seeing (WFM-noAO).
