Description: ESO data reduction pipeline for the MUSE instrument
 This is the data reduction pipeline for the Muse instrument of the
 Very Large Telescope (VLT) from the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
 .
 MUSE, the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, is an Integral Field
 Spectrograph located at the Nasmyth B focus of Yepun, the VLT UT4
 telescope. It has a modular structure composed of 24 identical IFU modules
 that together sample, in Wide Field Mode (WFM), a near-contiguous 1 squared
 arcmin field of view. Spectrally the instrument samples almost the full
 optical domain with a mean resolution of 3000. Spatially, the instrument
 samples the sky with 0.2 arcseconds spatial pixels in the currently offered
 Wide Field Mode with natural seeing (WFM-noAO).
