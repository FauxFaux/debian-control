Description: ESO data reduction pipeline for the SINFONI instrument
 This is the data reduction pipeline for the SINFONI instrument of the
 Very Large Telescope (VLT) from the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
 .
 SINFONI is a near-infrared (1.1 - 2.45 Âµm) integral field spectrograph fed by
 an adaptive optics module, currently installed at the Cassegrain focus of
 UT4. The spectrograph operates with 4 gratings (J, H, K, H+K) providing a
 spectral resolution around 2000, 3000, 4000 in J, H, K, respectively, and
 1500 in H+K - each wavelength band fitting fully on the 2048 pixels of the
 Hawaii 2RG (2kx2k) detector in the dispersion direction. The spatial
 resolution is selectable from 0.25", 0.1" to 0.025" per image slice, which
 corresponds to a field-of-view of 8"x8", 3"x3", or 0.8"x0.8"
 respectively. The instrument can be also used for seeing limited open loop
 observations.
