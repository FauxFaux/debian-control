Description: ESO data reduction pipeline for the UVES instrument
 This is the data reduction pipeline for the UVES instrument of the Very
 Large Telescope (VLT) from the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
 .
 UVES is a cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph designed to operate with
 high efficiency from the atmospheric cut-off at 300 nm to the long
 wavelength limit of the CCD detectors (about 1100 nm). The light beam
 from the telescope is split in two arms (UV to Blue, and Visual to Red)
 within the instrument. The two arms can be operated separately, or in
 parallel via a dichroic beam splitter. The resolving power is about
 40,000 when a 1-arcsec slit is used. The maximum (two-pixel) resolution
 is 80,000 or 110,000 in the Blue- and the Red Arm, respectively.
