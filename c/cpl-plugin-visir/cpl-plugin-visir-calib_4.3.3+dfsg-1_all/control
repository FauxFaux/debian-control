Description: ESO data reduction pipeline calibration data downloader for VISIR
 This package downloads calibration and other static data of the
 data reduction pipeline for the Visir instrument of the
 Very Large Telescope (VLT) from the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
 .
 The VLT spectrometer and imager for the mid-infrared (VISIR) was built by
 CEA/DAPNIA/SAP and NFRA/ASTRON, and is  located at the Cassegrain focus of
 UT3. It provides diffraction-limited imaging at high sensitivity in the two
 mid infrared (MIR) atmospheric windows: the N band between 8 to 13μm and the Q
 band between 16.5 and 24.5μm, respectively. In addition, it features a
 long-slitspectrometer with a range of spectral resolutions between 150 and
 30000.
