Description: ESO data reduction pipeline for the VISIR instrument
 This is the data reduction pipeline for the Visir instrument of the
 Very Large Telescope (VLT) from the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
 .
 The VLT spectrometer and imager for the mid-infrared (VISIR) was built by
 CEA/DAPNIA/SAP and NFRA/ASTRON, and is  located at the Cassegrain focus of
 UT3. It provides diffraction-limited imaging at high sensitivity in the two
 mid infrared (MIR) atmospheric windows: the N band between 8 to 13μm and the Q
 band between 16.5 and 24.5μm, respectively. In addition, it features a
 long-slitspectrometer with a range of spectral resolutions between 150 and
 30000.
