Description: Fundamental CPL data types and functions
 The CPLCORE library provides the fundamental CPL data types (such as cpl
 image, cpl table, cpl vector, cpl matrix etc.), the operations defined on
 these data types, and elementary utility functions. There should not be any
 physical units associated with any of the data types or functions of that
 library.
 .
 The Common Pipeline Library (CPL) comprises a set of ISO-C libraries that
 provide a comprehensive, efficient and robust software toolkit. It forms a
 basis for the creation of automated astronomical data-reduction tasks (known
 as "pipelines").
