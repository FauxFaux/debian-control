Description: CPL framework interface library
 The CPLUI (UI for User Interface) provides services defining the standard
 interface for recipes and provides more complex data reduction related
 utilities and services. In particular, it contains the necessary types to
 handle the plugin interface, the parameters used to handle command-line
 options and the (set of) frames used to store the input list of files.
 .
 The Common Pipeline Library (CPL) comprises a set of ISO-C libraries that
 provide a comprehensive, efficient and robust software toolkit. It forms a
 basis for the creation of automated astronomical data-reduction tasks (known
 as "pipelines").
