Description: C-Pluff, a plug-in framework for C - runtime library
 C-Pluff is a plug-in framework for C programs. It has been strongly
 inspired by the Java plug-in framework in Eclipse. C-Pluff focuses on
 providing core services for plug-in interaction and plug-in management.
 It aims to be platform neutral and supports dynamic changes to plug-in
 configuration without stopping the whole application or framework.
 .
 This package contains the C-Pluff runtime library.
