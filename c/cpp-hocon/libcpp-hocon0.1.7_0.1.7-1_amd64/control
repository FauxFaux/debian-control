Description: C++ port of the TypesafeConfig library -- shared libraries
 cpp-hocon is a port of the TypsafeConfig library to C++. It provides support
 for the HOCON configuration file format. HOCON aims to keep the semantics
 (tree structure; set of types; encoding/escaping) from JSON, but make it more
 convenient as a human-editable config file format.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
