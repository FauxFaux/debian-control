Description: Development files for C++ REST SDK / Casablanca
 The C++ REST SDK (codename "Casablanca") is a Microsoft project for cloud-based
 client-server communication in native code using a modern asynchronous C++ API
 design. This project allows C++ developers to take advantage of the radical
 shift in software architecture that cloud computing represents.
  * Support for accessing REST services from native code on Linux, Windows
    Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8 by providing asynchronous C++ bindings
    to HTTP, JSON, and URIs
  * Implementation of Asynchronous Streams and Stream Buffers
  * A consistent and powerful model for composing asynchronous operations based
    on C++ 11 features
  * A set of samples and reference documentation
  * New experimental features such as HTTP Listener library and support for
  Windows Phone 8 and Windows XP.
 .
 This package contains header files that are needed to develop and
 compile applications which utilizes the C++ REST SDK / Casablanca framework.
