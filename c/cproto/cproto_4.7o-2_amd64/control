Description: utilities to generate C function prototypes from C source code
 Cproto is a program that generates function prototypes and variable
 declarations from C source code.  It can also convert function
 definitions between the old style and the ANSI C style.  This
 conversion overwrites the original files, so make a backup copy of
 your files in case something goes wrong.
