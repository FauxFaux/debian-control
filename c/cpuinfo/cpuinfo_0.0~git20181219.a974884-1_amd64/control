Description: CPU INFOrmation library (binary utilities)
 cpuinfo is a library to detect essential for performance optimization
 information about host CPU.
 .
 Features
 .
   - **Cross-platform** availability:
     - Linux, Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS operating systems
     - x86, x86-64, ARM, and ARM64 architectures
   - Modern **C/C++ interface**
     - Thread-safe
     - No memory allocation after initialization
     - No exceptions thrown
   - Detection of **supported instruction sets**, up to AVX512 (x86) and
     ARMv8.3 extensions
   - Detection of SoC and core information:
     - **Processor (SoC) name**
     - Integrated **GPU name** (Android/iOS only)
     - Vendor, **microarchitecture**, and ID (**MIDR** on ARM, **CPUID**
       leaf 1 EAX value on x86) for each CPU core
   - Detection of **cache information**:
     - Cache type (instruction/data/unified), size and line size
     - Cache associativity
     - Cores and logical processors (hyper-threads) sharing the cache
   - Detection of **topology information** (relative between logical
     processors, cores, and processor packages)
   - Well-tested **production-quality** code:
     - 60+ mock tests based on data from real devices
     - Includes work-arounds for common bugs in hardware and OS kernels
     - Supports systems with heterogenous cores, such as **big.LITTLE**
       and Max.Med.Min
   - Permissive **open-source** license (Simplified BSD)
 .
 This package ships with several binary utilities.
