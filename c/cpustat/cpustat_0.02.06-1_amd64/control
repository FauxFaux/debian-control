Description: periodic cpu utilization statistics
 cpustat periodically reports the current CPU utilization of running tasks
 and can optionally report per CPU and per task utilization statistics at
 the end of a run.  cpustat has been designed and optimized to use a minimal
 amount of CPU cycles to monitor a system hence it is a light weight
 alternative to traditional process monitoring tools such as top.
