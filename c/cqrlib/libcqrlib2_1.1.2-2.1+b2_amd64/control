Description: Library for quaternion arithmetic and rotation math
 Quaternions are four-dimensional numbers which form an associative normed
 division algebra over the real numbers. Unit quaternions are a convenient
 and efficient way to represent orientations and rotations in three
 dimensions.
 .
 CQRlib is an ANSI C implementation of a utility library for quaternion
 arithmetic and quaternion rotation math.
