Description: pro-active password checker library
 Shared library for cracklib2 which contains a C function which may be
 used in a passwd like program. The idea is simple: try to prevent
 users from choosing passwords that could be guessed by crack by
 filtering them out, at source. cracklib2 is NOT a replacement passwd
 program. cracklib2 is a LIBRARY.
