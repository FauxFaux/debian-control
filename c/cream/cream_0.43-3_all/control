Description: VIM macros that make the VIM easier to use for beginners
 Cream's motto is "Cream makes the powerful Vim text editor easy!". It brings
 a completely different look and feel to the VIM for those who are used to more
 intuitive editors while still preserving the more powerful features of VIM.
 It features pull-down menus, color themes, bookmarking, auto spellcheck and
 more. It leaves the default VIM untouched and is started by running 'cream'.
