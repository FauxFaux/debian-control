Description: Test-Case Reduction for C Compiler Bugs
 C-Reduce is a tool which takes a large C or C++ program that has a
 property of interest (such as triggering a compiler bug) and
 automatically produces a much smaller C/C++ program that has the same
 property.  It is intended for use by people who discover and report
 bugs in compilers and other tools that process C/C++ code.
