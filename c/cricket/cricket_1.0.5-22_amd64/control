Description: Program for collection and display of time-series data
 This is Cricket. It is a configuration, polling, and data-display engine
 wrapped around the RRD tool by Tobias Oetiker. There are three user-visible
 pieces to Cricket: the collector, the grapher, and the config tree. The
 collector runs from cron and fetches data from a number of devices
 according to the info it finds in the config tree. The grapher is a CGI
 application that allows users to traverse the config tree from a web
 browser and see the data that the collector recorded.
