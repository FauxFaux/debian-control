Description: terminal-based ripper/encoder/tagger tool
 crip creates Ogg Vorbis/FLAC/MP3 files under UNIX/Linux. It is
 well-suited for anyone (especially the perfectionist) who seeks to
 make a lot of files from CDs and have them all properly labeled and
 professional-quality with a minimum of hassle and yet still have
 flexibility and full control over everything. Current versions of
 crip only support Ogg Vorbis and FLAC.
 .
 This script is special because it is capable of doing group
 vorbisgain/replaygain and/or normalization (adjust the volume to be
 as loud as possible without clipping/distortion) and group
 labelling/tagging, which makes it easy to allow a group of tracks to
 be treated as one piece. It can also trim off the silence at the
 beginning and end of these tracks/groups.
