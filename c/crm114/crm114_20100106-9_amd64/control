Description: versatile classifier for e-mail and other data
 CRM114, the Controllable Regex Mutilator, is a system to examine incoming
 e-mail, system log streams, data files, or other data streams, and to sort,
 filter, or alter the incoming files or data streams however the user
 desires. Criteria for categorization of data can be by satisfaction of
 regular expressions, by sparse binary polynomial matching with a Bayesian
 Chain Rule evaluator, or by other means.
 .
 CRM114 is not just another drop-in spam-filtering system; its Sparse
 Binary Polynomial Hashing methods give it the power to develop highly
 accurate Bayesian filters on very little training.
 .
 CRM114 is compatible with SpamAssassin or other spam-flagging software; it
 can also be pipelined in front of or behind procmail. CRM114 is also useful
 as a syslog or firewall log filter, to flag up important events but ignore
 the ones that aren't meaningful.
 .
 For mail filtering, installing metamail or mew-bin packages is
 recommended in order to have tools to decode MIME attachments.
