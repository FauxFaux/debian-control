 Crossfire is a multiplayer graphical arcade and adventure game made
 for the X environment.  It has certain flavours from other games,
 especially Gauntlet (TM) and Nethack/Moria.  Any number of players
 can move around in their own window, finding and using items and
 battle monsters.  They can choose to cooperate or compete in the same
 world.
