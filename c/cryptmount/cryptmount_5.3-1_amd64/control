Description: Management of encrypted file systems
 cryptmount is a utility for creating encrypted filesystems & swap partitions
 and which allows an ordinary user to mount/unmount filesystems
 without requiring superuser privileges.
 .
 It offers the following features:
    * easy and safe on-demand access to filesystems without su/sudo;
    * access passwords can be changed easily without involving the sys-admin;
    * filesystems can reside on raw disk partitions or ordinary files;
    * supports LUKS encrypted filesystems created by cryptsetup;
    * encrypted access keys can be stored on removable media
      (e.g. USB flash disks);
    * includes support for encrypted swap partitions;
    * multiple filesystems can be stored in a single disk partition;
    * encrypted filesystems can be initialized at boot-up or on demand;
    * temporary filesystems can be setup via command-line,
      for use in shell-scripts;
    * transparent configuration of dm-crypt & loopback devices during mounting;
    * access keys can optionally be made compatible with OpenSSL.
