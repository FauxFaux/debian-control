Description: Clojure library protecting against timing attacks
 crypto-equality is a very small Clojure library for protecting against timing
 attacks when comparing strings or sequences of bytes. It is primarily indented
 for comparing user-supplied values against secrets held by the application,
 such as tokens or keys.
