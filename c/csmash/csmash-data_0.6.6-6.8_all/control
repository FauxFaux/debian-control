Description: data files for the CannonSmash game
 CannonSmash is a funny 3D table tennis game. It takes a while to get
 your hand at ease with the mouse+keyboard manipulations. But once
 you're used to the technique, you can feel like playing a real game.
 It is playable against the computer or through a network.
