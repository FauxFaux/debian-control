Description: generator of random C programs (runtime library)
 Csmith is a tool that can generate random C programs that statically
 and dynamically conform to the C99 standard. Thus, it is useful for
 stress-testing compilers, static analyzers, and other tools that
 process C code.
 .
 This package contains the runtime library files needed to run software
 using csmith.
