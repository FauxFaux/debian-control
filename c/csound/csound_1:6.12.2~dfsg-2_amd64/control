Description: powerful and versatile sound synthesis software
 Csound is a sound and music synthesis system. Drawing from over 450
 signal processing modules, it can be used to model virtually any
 synthesizer or multi-effect processor. It can work either in real-time
 or as a compiler.
 .
 Csound is to sound synthesis as C is to programming.
