Description: XML+CSS2 to XSL-FO converter
 CSSToXSLFO is a utility which can convert an XML document, together with a
 CSS2 style sheet, into an XSL-FO document, which can then be converted into
 PDF, PostScript, etc. with an XSL-FO-processor. It has special support for the
 XHTML vocabulary, because that is the most obvious language it would be used
 for. The tool has a number of page-related extensions. It also comes with an
 API in the form of an XML filter.
