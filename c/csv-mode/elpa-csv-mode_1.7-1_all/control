Description: Emacs major mode for editing comma/char separated values
 This package implements CSV mode, a major mode for editing records
 in a generalised CSV (character-separated values) format. CSV mode
 supports operations such as the following:
 .
   * sort lexicographically and numerically on a specified
     field or column.
   * kill and yank by field or column.  C-c C-k can kill more than one
     field at once, but multiple killed fields can be yanked only as a
     fixed group equivalent to a single field.
   * align fields into columns
   * interchange between rows and columns.
 .
 CSV mode can recognise fields separated by a number of individual
 characters, configurable in `csv-separators'.  CSV data fields can be
 delimited with quote characters.  This implementation supports quoted
 fields, where all permitted quote characters are specified in the
 customisable user option `csv-field-quotes'.  By default, the only
 separator is a comma and the only field quote is a double quote.
 .
 The global minor mode `csv-field-index-mode' displays the current
 field index in the mode line, cf. `line-number-mode' and
 `column-number-mode'.  It is on by default.
