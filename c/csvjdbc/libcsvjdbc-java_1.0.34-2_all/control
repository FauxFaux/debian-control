Description: read-only JDBC driver that uses CSV or DBF files as database tables
 CsvJdbc is a read-only JDBC driver that uses Comma Separated Value (CSV) files
 or DBF files as database tables. It is ideal for writing data import programs
 or analyzing log files.
 .
 The driver enables a directory or a ZIP file containing CSV or DBF files to be
 accessed as though it were a database containing tables. However, as there is
 no real database management system behind the scenes, not all JDBC
 functionality is available.
