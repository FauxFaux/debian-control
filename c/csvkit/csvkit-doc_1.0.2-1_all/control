Description: documentation for csvkit
 csvkit is a suite of command-line tools for converting to and working with
 CSV, the king of tabular file formats.
 .
 It is inspired by pdftk, gdal and the original csvcut tool by Joe Germuska and
 Aaron Bycoffe.
 .
 If you need to do more complex data analysis than csvkit can handle, use
 agate.
 .
 This package provides the documentation.
