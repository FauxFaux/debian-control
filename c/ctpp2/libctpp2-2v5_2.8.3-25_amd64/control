Description: HTML template engine for C++
 CTPP is a suitable choice for projects where a programmer and an HTML
 designer are different people. The goal of CTPP development was to
 achieve maximum performance with minimal basic functionality that is
 easily expandable. In other words, any conceivable capabilities can be
 added by writing users functions.
 .
 CTPP has following advantages over other template engines:
  * Very High performance as this is written in C++
  * Flexible syntax of templates
  * Robustness
  * Portability
  * Support for implementations in the language your choice
  * Various template sources
  * Output data filters
  * User functions
