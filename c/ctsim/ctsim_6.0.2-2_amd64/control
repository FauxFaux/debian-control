Description: Computed tomography simulator
 CTSim provides an interactive computed tomography simulator. Computed
 tomography is the technique of estimating the interior of an object
 by measuring x-ray absorption through that object.
 .
 CTSim has both command-line tools and a graphical user interface.
 CTSim has very educational trace modes for viewing the data
 collection simulation as well as the reconstruction.
