Description: OCaml library to access descriptions of package upgrade problems
 libCUDF is a library to manipulate so called CUDF documents. A CUDF
 document describe an upgrade problem, as faced by package managers in
 popular package-based GNU/Linux distributions.
 .
 A CUDF document consists of a package universe and of a user request.
 The package universe describes all packages known to the package
 manager, a subset of which (the package status) denotes the package
 being currently installed on the target machine.  The user request
 denotes a change to the package status as requested by the user.
 .
 A CUDF document is naturally complemented by a solution describing
 the resulting package status (if any) implementing the user request,
 as found by a package manager.
 .
 libCUDF enables manipulation of CUDF and related documents.
 .
 This package contains all the development stuff you need to use
 libCUDF in your OCaml programs.
