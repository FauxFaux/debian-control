Description: generate dictionaries for attacks from personal data
 CUPP (Common User Passwords Profiler) is a wordlist generator tool that
 can generate wordlists from information such as a birthday, nickname,
 address, name of a pet or relative, or a common word such as God, love,
 money or password.

 A weak password might be very short or only use alphanumeric characters,
 making decryption simple. A weak password can also be one that is easily
 guessed by someone profiling the user, such as a birthday, nickname,
 address, name of a pet or relative, or a common word such as God, love,
 money or password. From a social engineering you can obtain information

 penetration tests or forensic crime investigations.
