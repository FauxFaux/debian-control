Description: Common UNIX Printing System(tm) - BSD commands
 The Common UNIX Printing System (or CUPS(tm)) is a printing system and
 general replacement for lpr, lpd and the like.  It supports the
 Internet Printing Protocol (IPP), and has its own filtering driver
 model for handling various document types.
 .
 This package provides the BSD commands for interacting with CUPS.  It
 is provided separately to allow CUPS to coexist with other printing
 systems (to a small degree).
