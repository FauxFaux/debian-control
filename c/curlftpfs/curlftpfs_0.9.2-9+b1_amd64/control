Description: filesystem to access FTP hosts based on FUSE and cURL
 CurlFtpFS is a tool to mount FTP hosts as local directories. It connects
 to a FTP server and maps its directory structure to the local filesystem.
 .
 Based on FUSE (filesystem in userspace) and the cURL library, CurlFtpFS
 has some features that distinguish it over other FTP filesystems:
  * support for SSLv3 and TLSv1
  * connecting through tunneling HTTP proxies
  * automatic reconnection if the server times out
  * conversion of absolute symlinks to point back into the FTP filesystem
