Description: Standard libraries of the Curry distributions PAKCS and KiCS2 (source files)
 PAKCS and KICS2 are two different implementations of the programming
 language Curry. Curry is a functional programming language being developed
 at Kiel, Aachen and Portland University.
 .
 Whereas PAKCS is a Curry to Prolog compiler, KICS2 compiles Curry code
 into Haskell. Both compilers require two source code trees at compiler
 build time: curry-libs-source and curry-tools-source.
 .
 This package provides the source files of the curry-libs.
