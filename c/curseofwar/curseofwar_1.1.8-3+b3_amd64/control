Description: Fast-paced  action  strategy  game for Linux based on ncurses
 Unlike  most  RTS,  you  are  not  controlling units, but focus on high-level
 strategic  planning:  Building infrastructure, securing resources, and moving
 your  armies. The core game mechanics turns out to be quite close to WWI-WWII
 type   of   warfare,   however,   there  is  no  explicit  reference  to  any
 historical period.
