Description: simple demodulation and spectrum display program
 The CuteSDR application's primary purpose is for spawning custom
 applications or for educational use. It is NOT a full featured
 program as it is purposely kept simple in order for developers to
 more easily spin off their own applications. A further goal was to
 use only the stock functionality of Qt ie no libraries or special
 drivers. This limits CuteSDR to using only a network connection.
 The main gui and framework is written by Moe Wheatly, AE4JY.
 .
 CuteSDR itself has only a network interface and will directly support
 the RFSPACE NetSDR and SDR-IP radios. The siqs_ftdi and SDRxxServer
 applications (packaged separately) provide network interfaces to
 RFSPACE USB devices.
