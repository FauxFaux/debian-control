Description: data files for the game cuyo
 Cuyo, named after a Spanish relative adjective, shares
 with tetris that things fall down and how to navigate them.
 When enough "of the same type" come "together", they explode.
 The goal of each level is to blow special "stones" away, you
 start with. But what "of the same type" and "together" means,
 varies with the levels.
 .
 This package contains the graphics, sounds, level description
 and man pages for cuyo.
