Description: Tetris-like game with very impressive effects
 Cuyo, named after a Spanish relative adjective, shares
 with tetris that things fall down and how to navigate them.
 When enough "of the same type" come "together", they explode.
 The goal of each level is to blow special "stones" away, you
 start with. But what "of the same type" and "together" means,
 varies with the levels.
