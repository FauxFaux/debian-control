Description: Automatic theorem prover library for SMT problems (development files)
 CVC3 is an automatic theorem prover for Satisfiability Modulo Theories
 (SMT) problems. It can be used to prove the validity (or, dually, the
 satisfiability) of first-order formulas in a large number of built-in
 logical theories and their combination.
 .
 CVC3 is the last offspring of a series of popular SMT provers, which
 originated at Stanford University with the SVC system. In particular,
 it builds on the code base of CVC Lite, its most recent
 predecessor. Its high level design follows that of the Sammy prover.
 .
 CVC3 works with a version of first-order logic with polymorphic types
 and has a wide variety of features including:
 .
   * several built-in base theories: rational and integer linear
     arithmetic, arrays, tuples, records, inductive data types, bit
     vectors, and equality over uninterpreted function symbols;
   * support for quantifiers;
   * an interactive text-based interface;
   * rich C, C++, and Java APIs for embedding in other systems;
   * proof and model generation abilities;
   * predicate subtyping;
   * essentially no limit on its use for research or commercial
     purposes (see license).
 .
 This package contains the files necessary for building applications
 that use the CVC3 library.
