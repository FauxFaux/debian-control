Description: automated theorem prover for SMT problems (development files)
 CVC4 is an efficient automatic theorem prover for satisfiability
 modulo theories (SMT) problems. It can be used to prove the validity
 (or, dually, the satisfiability) of first-order formulas in a large
 number of built-in logical theories and their combination.
 .
 CVC4 is intended to be an open and extensible SMT engine, and it can
 be used as a stand-alone tool or as a library. It is the fourth in
 the Cooperating Validity Checker family of tools (also including CVC,
 CVC Lite and CVC3). CVC4 has been designed to increase the
 performance and reduce the memory overhead of its predecessors.
 .
 This package contains development files for CVC4. Install it if you
 want to develop applications that use CVC4's API.
