Description: set of Debian package scripts for CVS source trees
 This package provides the capability to inject or import Debian
 source packages into a CVS repository, build a Debian package from
 the CVS repository, and helps in integrating upstream changes into
 the repository.
 .
 The import or inject process takes a dsc (Debian source control)
 file, and imports it into CVS. The module path can maintains
 distribution and section information; for example, one may inject
 hemm/hemm/devel/make into the repository.
 .
 The build process works analogously to dpkg-buildpackage, and can be
 used from within the checked out source tree, or with additional
 information, can be used from anywhere. In the latter case, you can
 build any previous version of the package, as long as the
 corresponding orig.tar.gz file is still around. The build script
 checks out the relevant version from the CVS repository, and runs
 dpkg-buildpackage to create the Debian package.
 .
 Combined, these utilities provide an infrastructure to facilitate the
 use of CVS by Debian maintainers. This allows one to keep separate
 CVS branches of a package for stable, unstable, and possibly
 experimental distributions, along with the other benefits of a
 version control system.
 .
 This can be used to generate a unified CVS source tree, for example.
