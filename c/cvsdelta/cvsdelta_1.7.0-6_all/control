Description: Summarize differences in a CVS repository
 cvsdelta summarizes the difference between a CVS project and its
 local version. It detects files that have been added and removed, and
 of existing files it counts the number of lines that have been added,
 deleted, and changed. It filters project changes by using .cvsignore
 files, both system-wide and locally.
