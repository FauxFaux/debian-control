Description: Tool to generate CVS patch set information
 CVSps is a program for generating 'patch set' information from a CVS
 repository.  A patch set in this case is defined as a set of changes made
 to a collection of files, all committed at the same time (using a single
 'cvs commit' command).  This information is valuable for seeing the
 big picture of the evolution of a CVS project.  While CVS tracks revision
 information, it is often difficult to see what changes were committed
 'atomically' to the repository.
