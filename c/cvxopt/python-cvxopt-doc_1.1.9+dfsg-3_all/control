Description: Python package for convex optimization (documentation)
 CVXOPT is a Python package for convex optimization. It includes
  * Python classes for storing and manipulating dense and sparse matrices
  * an interface to most of the double-precision real and complex BLAS
  * an interface to the dense linear equation solvers and eigenvalue
    routines from LAPACK
  * interfaces to the sparse LU and Cholesky solvers from UMFPACK and
    CHOLMOD.
  * routines for solving convex optimization problems, an interface to
    the linear programming solver in GLPK, and interfaces to the
    linear and quadratic programming solvers in MOSEK
  * a modeling tool for specifying convex piecewise-linear
    optimization problems.
 .
 This package contains the documentation of the Python module.
