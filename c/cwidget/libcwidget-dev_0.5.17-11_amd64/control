Description: high-level terminal interface library for C++ (development files)
 libcwidget is a modern user interface library modeled on GTK+ and Qt,
 but using curses as its display layer and with widgets that are
 tailored to a terminal environment.
 .
 This package contains files that are needed to write or compile
 software that uses libcwidget.
 .
 WARNING: this is a newly created library whose development is closely
 tied to the development of aptitude.  Its API may be incomplete and
 is likely to change considerably version-over-version!  You may want
 to avoid cwidget for stable projects.
