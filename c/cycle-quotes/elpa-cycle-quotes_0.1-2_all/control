Description: Emacs command to cycle between quotation marks
 This package provides the `cycle-quotes' command to cycle between
 different string quote styles.
 .
 For example, in JavaScript, there are three string quote characters:
 ", ` and '.  In a JavaScript buffer, with point located someplace
 within the string, `cycle-quotes' will cycle between the following
 quote styles each time it's called:
 .
 --> "Hi, it's me!" --> `Hi, it's me!` --> 'Hi, it\'s me!'
 .
 As seen in the above example, `cycle-quotes' tries to escape and
 unescape quote characters intelligently.
