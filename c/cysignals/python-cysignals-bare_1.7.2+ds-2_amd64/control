Description: interrupt and signal handling for Cython -- Python - bare
 Since Cython optimizes for speed, Cython normally does not check
 for interrupts. The cysignals package provides mechanisms to handle
 interrupts (and other signals and errors) in Cython code.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 2; this very library
 was not built against the PARI/GP library.
