Description: Formatting numbers for human consumption - NodeJS module
 Sometimes JavaScript doesn’t display numbers the way you expect. For example,
 printing tenths with a naive simple loop might give you 0, 0.1, 0.2,
 0.30000000000000004, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6000000000000001, 0.7000000000000001, 0.8,
 0.9 - welcome to binary floating point!
 .
 Yet rounding error is not the only reason to customize number formatting. A
 table of numbers should be formatted consistently for comparison; above, 0.0
 would be better than 0. Large numbers should have grouped digits (e.g.,
 42,000) or be in scientific or metric notation (4.2e+4, 42k). Currencies
 should have fixed precision ($3.50). Reported numerical results should be
 rounded to significant digits (4021 becomes 4000). Number formats should
 appropriate to the reader’s locale (42.000,00 or 42,000.00). The list goes on.
 .
 Formatting numbers for human consumption is the purpose of d3-format, which is
 modeled after Python 3’s format specification mini-language (PEP 3101).

 This package contains the NodeJS package.
