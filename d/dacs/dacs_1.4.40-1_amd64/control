Description: Distributed Access Control System (DACS)
 DACS is a light-weight single sign-on and role-based access control system
 for web servers and server-based software. It is also an authentication and
 authorization toolkit for programmers. DACS makes secure resource sharing
 and remote access via the web easier, safer, and more efficient.
 .
 DACS provides:
 .
   * universal, extensible, modular, and efficient authentication methods,
     including two-factor authentication and hardware tokens
   * powerful, comprehensive, rule-based authorization checking that can
     be applied selectively and transparently to any resource or activity
     (such as web services, web content, and program features) by
     Apache-based web services, CGI programs, servlets, or virtually any
     program or script
   * secure, web-based single sign-on (SSO)
   * flexible, programmable configuration
   * an Apache 2.0/2.2 module, suite of CGI-based programs, and collection
     of command line tools
