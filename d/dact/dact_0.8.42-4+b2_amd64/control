Description: multi-algorithm compression
 DACT compresses each block within the file with all its known algorithms and
 uses the block with the best compression ratio.
 .
 DACT can encrypt the compressed data with one of two algorithms.
 .
 Compression time for DACT is slow as each block is compressed multiple times.
 .
 Current supported compression algorithms include RLE, Delta, Text, Zlib,
 Modified Zlib, Bzip2 and Seminibble Encoding.
