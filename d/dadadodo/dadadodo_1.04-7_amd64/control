Description: exterminates all rational thought
 DadaDodo is a program that analyses texts for Markov chains of word
 probabilities and then generates random sentences based on that.
 Sometimes these sentences are nonsense; but sometimes they cut right
 through to the heart of the matter and reveal hidden meanings.
