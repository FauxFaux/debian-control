Description: tool to run a command as a daemon
 As defined in W. Richard Stevens’ 1990 book, UNIX Network Programming
 (Addison-Wesley, 1990), a daemon is “a process that executes ‘in the
 background’ i.e., without an associated terminal or login shell) either
 waiting for some event to occur, or waiting to perform some specified task on a
 periodic basis.” Upon startup, a typical daemon program will:
 .
  * Close all open file descriptors (especially standard input, standard output
    and standard error)
  * Change its working directory to the root filesystem, to ensure that it
    doesn’t tie up another filesystem and prevent it from being unmounted
  * Reset its umask value
  * Run in the background (i.e., fork)
  * Disassociate from its process group (usually a shell), to insulate itself
    from signals (such as HUP) sent to the process group
  * Ignore all terminal I/O signals
  * Disassociate from the control terminal (and take steps not to reacquire one)
  * Handle any SIGCLD signals
 .
 Most programs that are designed to be run as daemons do that work for
 themselves. However, you’ll occasionally run across one that does not. When
 you must run a daemon program that does not properly make itself into a true
 Unix daemon, you can use daemonize to force it to run as a true daemon.
