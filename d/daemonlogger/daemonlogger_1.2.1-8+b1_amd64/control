Description: simple network packet logger and soft tap daemon
 DaemonLogger is a simple packet logger and soft tap daemon that is
 incredibly useful for network security analysts.
 .
 It is capable of operating in two modes: sniffing packets and
 logging them directly to disk (files are automatically rolled over
 after a set size), or in a "soft-tap" mode where it mirrors packets
 on another interface.
 .
 Daemonlogger can be run either in the foreground or in the background
 as a daemon.
