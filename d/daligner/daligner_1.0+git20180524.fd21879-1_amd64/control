Description: local alignment discovery between long nucleotide sequencing reads
 These tools permit one to find all significant local alignments between
 reads encoded in a Dazzler database. The assumption is that the reads are
 from a Pacific Biosciences RS II long read sequencer. That is, the reads
 are long and noisy, up to 15% on average.
