Description: SOCKS wrapper for users behind a firewall
 Dante is a circuit-level firewall/proxy that can be used to provide
 convenient and secure network connectivity to a wide range of hosts
 while requiring only the server Dante runs on to have external network
 connectivity.
 .
 This package provides the "socksify" client program - a tool which
 forwards network requests from any program to a SOCKS server (v4 or v5)
 which then performs them on your behalf.
