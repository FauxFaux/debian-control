Description: Live audio streamer
 DarkIce is an IceCast, IceCast2 and ShoutCast live audio streamer. It
 takes audio input from a sound card, encodes it into mp3 and/or Ogg
 Vorbis, and sends the mp3 stream to one or more IceCast and/or
 ShoutCast servers, the Ogg Vorbis stream to one or more IceCast2
 servers. DarkIce uses lame as a shared object as its mp3 encoder, and
 the Ogg Vorbis as its Ogg Vorbis encoder.
 .
 A legacy SYSV init script is provided for existing
 configurations. You have to set RUN=yes in /etc/default/darkice to
 run darkice as a daemon. With modern systems, this is not needed as
 realtime scheduling is available to normal users.
