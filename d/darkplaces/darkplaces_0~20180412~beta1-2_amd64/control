Description: Game engine for Quake and similar 3D first person shooter games
 DarkPlaces is a graphically-intensive engine for Quake and related games, with
 improved visual effects and lighting and many features for mods.
 It can be used to play various games based on the Quake engine, such as
 Xonotic, Nexuiz Classic, OpenQuartz, and Quake itself.
 .
 This is the client version of the engine, with a SDL GUI.
 .
 This engine isn't useful without game data: to get a playable game, install
 nexuiz or another suitable set of game data. It is typically used via a
 script that launches it with a particular data set, such as the ones
 found in the "quake" and "nexuiz" packages.
