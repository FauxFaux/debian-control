Description: network traffic analyzer
 It is a packet sniffer which runs as a background process and serves its
 statistics to a web browser:
  - input and output IP traffic by machines, ports and protocols,
  - last minute, hourly, daily and monthly global input and output graphics.
 .
 It is known to be smaller (in terms of memory footprint) and stabler than ntop.
