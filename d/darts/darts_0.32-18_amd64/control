Description: C++ Template Library for implementation of Double-Array
 Darts is simple C++ Template Library for implementation of Double-Array
 Structure.
 .
 A double-array structure is a kind of Trie structure, digital search tree,
 an efficient data structure combining fast access of a matrix form with the
 compactness of a list form. It is faster than other implementations like Hash
 tree, Patricia tree, Suffix Array and so.
 .
 For more detail about double-array structure, see "Aoe, J. An Efficient
 Digital Search Algorithm by Using a Double-Array Structure. IEEE Transactions
 on Software Engineering. Vol. 15, 9 (Sep 1989). pp. 1066-1077."
 .
 This software provides indexing operations for Common Prefix Search.
 Darts is used for MeCab and ChaSen, Japanese Morphological Analysis System.
