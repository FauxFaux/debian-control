Description: solves system lock-ups by making all processes non-realtime
 Das_Watchdog is a general watchdog for the Linux operating system that
 should be run in the background at all times to ensure a realtime process
 won't hang the machine.
 .
 Das_Watchdog is inspired by the rt_watchdog program from Florian Schmidt,
 but has some improvements over it:
  * It works with 2.4 kernels as well as 2.6.
  * Instead of permanently setting all realtime processes to run
    non-realtime, das_watchdog only sets them temporary.
  * When the watchdog kicks in, an X window should pop up that tells you
    whats happening (just close it after reading the message).
