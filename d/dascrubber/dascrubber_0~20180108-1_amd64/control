Description: alignment-based scrubbing pipeline for DNA sequencing reads
 The Dazzler Scrubbing Suite produces a set of edited reads that are guaranteed
 to
  * be continuous stretches of the underlying genome (i.e. no unremoved
    adapters and not chimers)
  * have no very low quality stretches (i.e. the error rate never exceeds some
    reasonable maximum, 20% or so in the case of Pacbio data).
 Its secondary goal is to do so with the minimum removal of data and splitting
 of reads.
