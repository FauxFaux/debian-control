Description: graphical predictive text input system
 Dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by natural
 continuous pointing gestures. Dasher is a competitive text-entry system
 wherever a full-size keyboard cannot be used - for example,
 .
  * on a palmtop computer
  * on a wearable computer
  * when operating a computer one-handed, by joystick, touchscreen, trackball,
  or mouse
  * when operating a computer with zero hands (i.e., by head-mouse or by
  eyetracker).
 .
 The eyetracking version of Dasher allows an experienced user to write text
 as fast as normal handwriting - 25 words per minute; using a mouse,
 experienced users can write at 39 words per minute.
 .
 Dasher uses a more advanced prediction algorithm than the T9(tm) system
 often used in mobile phones, making it sensitive to surrounding context.
