Description: extensions for the jQuery plug-in for tables from different data sources
 DataTables is a plug-in for the jQuery Javascript library. It is a
 highly flexible tool, based upon the foundations of progressive
 enhancement, which will add advanced interaction controls such as
 variable length pagination or on-the-fly filtering to any HTML table.
 .
 The features that DataTables provides can be greatly enhanced by the use
 of the plug-ins available on this page, which give many new user
 interaction and configuration options. This package provides those
 extensions.
