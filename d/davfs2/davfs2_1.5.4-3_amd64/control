Description: mount a WebDAV resource as a regular file system
 Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV), an extension to the
 HTTP-protocol, allows authoring of resources on a remote
 web server. davfs2 provides the ability to access such resources like
 a typical filesystem, allowing for use by standard applications with no
 built-in support for WebDAV.
 .
 davfs2 is designed to fully integrate into the filesystem semantics of
 Unix-like systems (mount, umount, et c.). davfs2 makes
 mounting by unprivileged users as easy and secure as possible.
 .
 davfs2 does extensive caching to make the file system responsive,
 to avoid unnecessary network traffic and to prevent data loss, and to cope
 for slow or unreliable connections.
 .
 davfs2 will work with most WebDAV servers needing little or no configuration.
