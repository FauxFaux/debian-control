 in the Berkeley v5.3 database format, and includes:

    checkpoint it periodically.

    abort lock requests when a deadlock is detected.
  - db5.3_load: loads (and creates) a database from standard input.
  - db5.3_dump: read a database file and write it in a format understood
    by db4.{2..8}_load.
  - db5.3_printlog: dump log files in human readable format.
  - db5.3_stat: display statistics for Berkeley DB environments.
