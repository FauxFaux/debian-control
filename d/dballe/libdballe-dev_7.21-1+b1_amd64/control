Description: DB-All.e C development library for weather research
 DB-All.e is a fast on-disk database where meteorological observed and
 forecast data can be stored, searched, retrieved and updated.
 .
 The Debian packaging of DB-All.e includes all the features of the libraries,
 but any subset can be used without interference from other subsets.  It is
 also possible to rebuild the library to include only those features that are
 needed.
 .
 Features provided:
 .
  * Unit conversion
  * Handling of physical variables
  * Encoding and decoding of BUFR and CREX reports from:
     * fixed land and sea stations, like synops and buoys
     * mobile stations: ships, airplanes
     * soundings: temp, pilot
     * METAR reports
     * Satellite strides (decode only)
  * Decoding of AOF reports
  * Interpretation of weather reports as physical data precisely located in
    space and time, and encoding of physical data into weather reports.
  * Smart on-disk database for observed and forecast weather data based on
    physical principles, built to support operations such as quality control,
    data thinning, correlation of data from mixed sources
