Description: framework that helps packages to manage databases
 This package contains the core of the dbconfig-common framework. This
 framework presents a policy and implementation for managing various databases
 used by applications included in Debian packages.
 .
 It can:
  - support MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and SQLite based applications;
  - create or remove databases and database users;
  - access local or remote databases;
  - upgrade/modify databases when upstream changes database structure;
  - generate config files in many formats with the database info;
  - import configs from packages previously managing databases on their own;
  - prompt users with a set of normalized, pre-translated questions;
  - handle failures gracefully, with an option to retry;
  - do all the hard work automatically;
  - work for package maintainers with little effort on their part;
  - work for local admins with little effort on their part;
  - comply with an agreed upon set of standards for behavior;
  - do absolutely nothing if that is the whim of the local admin;
  - perform all operations from within the standard flow of
    package management (no additional skill is required of the local
    admin).
