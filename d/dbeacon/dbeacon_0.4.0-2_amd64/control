Description: Multicast beacon
 dbeacon is a multicast beacon: its main purpose is to monitor other beacons'
 reachability and collect statistics such as loss, delay and jitter between
 them.
 .
 dbeacon supports both IPv4 and IPv6 multicast, collecting information using
 both Any Source Multicast (ASM) and Source-Specific Multicast (SSM).
 .
 This package also includes dbeacon matrix, a Perl script to generate beacon
 reachability matrices in HTML.
