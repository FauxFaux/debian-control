Description: simple interprocess messaging system (Java Binaries)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 This package provides several programs using the Java implementation
 of D-Bus. This includes a simple D-Bus daemon for use in session buses,
 A tool for generating Java stubs from D-Bus introspection data and
 a graphical browser for D-Bus connections.
 .
 See the dbus description for more information about D-Bus in general.
