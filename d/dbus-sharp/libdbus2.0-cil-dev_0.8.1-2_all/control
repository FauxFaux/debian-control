Description: CLI implementation of D-Bus - development files
 dbus-sharp is a fork of ndesk-dbus, which is a C# implementation of
 D-Bus. It's often referred to as "managed D-Bus" to avoid confusion
 with existing bindings (which wrap libdbus).
 .
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between
 applications.  Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets
 and CORBA in terms of complexity.
 .
 This package contains development files for dbus-sharp, and should be
 used for compilation.
