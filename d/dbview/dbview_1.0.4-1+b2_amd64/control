Description: View dBase III files
 Dbview is a little tool that will display dBase III and IV
 files. You can also use it to convert your old .dbf files
 for further use with Unix.

 It wasn't the intention to write a freaking viewer and
 reinvent the wheel again. Instead dbview is intend to be
 used in conjunction with your favourite unix text utilities
 like cut, recode and more.
