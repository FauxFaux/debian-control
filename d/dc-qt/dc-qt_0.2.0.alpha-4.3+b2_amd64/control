Description: GUI frontend for the dc protocol
 dc-qt is a qt front-end for the dctc program. dctc handles all
 communication with dc hubs and clients, while dc-qt presents an
 interface that has many of the features of the original directconnect
 client, plus some really useful improvements.
 .
 It is intended for peer-based file-sharing. In practise it works better than
 gnutella and other similar systems as it allows dc hubs (servers)
 administators to require clients to share specified amount of data. The
 amount is usually based on type of client's connection and it is used not
 to hurt or exclude anybody but to make file sharing "fair play".
 .
 dc-qt is still alpha, so some care has to be taken - try it out!
