Description: next generation DICOM to NIfTI converter
 dcm2niix is the successor of dcm2nii, a popular tool for converting images
 from the complicated formats used by scanner manufacturers (DICOM, PAR/REC)
 to the simpler NIfTI format used by many scientific tools. It works for all
 modalities (CT, MRI, PET, SPECT) and sequence types.
