Description: Command-line tools to process Debian package information
 Debian package information is generally stored in files having a
 special file format, dubbed the Debian control file format (the dctrl
 format), a special case of the record jar file format.  These tools
 operate on any files conforming in a general sense to that format and
 are therefore widely applicable whenever those formats are in play.
