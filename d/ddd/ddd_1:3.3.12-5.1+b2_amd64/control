Description: The Data Display Debugger, a graphical debugger frontend
 The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a popular graphical user interface to
 UNIX debuggers such as GDB, DBX, XDB, JDB and others. Besides typical
 front-end features such as viewing source texts and breakpoints, DDD
 provides an interactive graphical data display, where data structures are
 displayed as graphs. Using DDD, you can reason about your application by
 watching its data, not just by viewing it execute lines of source code.
 .
 Other DDD features include: debugging of programs written in Ada, Bash, C,
 C++, Chill, Fortran, Java, Modula, Pascal, Perl and Python; machine-level
 debugging; hypertext source navigation and lookup; breakpoint, backtrace,
 and history editors; preferences and settings editors; program execution
 in terminal emulator window; debugging on remote host; on-line manual;
 interactive help on the Motif user interface; GDB/DBX/XDB command-line
 interface with full editing, history, and completion capabilities.
 .
 This version is linked against Lesstif, an LGPL-ed implementation of Motif.
