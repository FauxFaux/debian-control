Description: Issues dynamic DNS v3 requests
 Dynamic DNS fixes your domain name when your IP address varies with
 permanent connections like cable modems. Your ISP may charge extra
 for DNS. Free dynamic DNS with a range of domain names is available
 from sites like dyndns.org, hn.org and ddns.nu. You set up an account
 and domain name with your browser at the dynamic DNS site then update
 the IP periodically with an appropriate client program.
 .
 This package installs a DNS update client, ddns3, for Dynamic DNS
 version 3 used by server ddns.nu in Sydney, Australia. After server
 account creation edit /etc/default/ddns3-client to activate ddns3.
