 Meant to be a compliment to gnuddrescue. It is a LINUX based set of utilities
 to help with data rescue. Find what files are related to the bad sectors using
 a ddrescue logfile, special NTFS utility to find files related to bad sectors,
 create a domain logfile to use with ddrescue to only recover the used portion
 of an NTFS partition, create a domain logfile to use with ddrescue to focus on
 recovering the MFT of an NTFS partition and perform some advanced disk read
 functions.
