Description: bridge hand generator
 This program generates bridge hands. It can be told to generate only hands
 satisfying conditions like being balanced, having a range of HCPs, controls,
 or other user-definable properties. Hands can be output in various formats,
 like pbn for feeding to other bridge programs, deal itself, or split up into a
 file per player for practise. Extensible via Tcl.
