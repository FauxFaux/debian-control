Description: tool to handle Debian package archives
 This tool can sort packages into a directory structure that apt-get
 and similar tools can use as an installation source (arranged in an
 old-style simple repository layout without package pools). It is meant
 to be used by administrators who need special packages, or
 tweaked versions to ease administration.
 .
 Package files placed in debarchiver's incoming directory along with the
 corresponding generated ".changes" file will be sorted by a cronjob
 into the appropriate directory of the repository.
