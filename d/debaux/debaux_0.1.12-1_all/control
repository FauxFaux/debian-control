Description: Debian Auxiliary Programs
 This package contains Perl programs and modules to build
 and publish Debian packages.
 .
 debaux-build automatically downloads APT sources before
 building, applies patches and additional sources. It
 has options to build the packages in an existing chroot
 environment, check the generated packages with lintian, install
 the created packages on your local system or turn them
 into RPM packages.
 .
 debaux-build has experimental support for downloading
 Perl modules from CPAN and creating the necessary Debian
 packaging files.
 .
 debaux-publish uploads packages and runs the scripts
 to create the APT sources and packages files on the
 remote system. debaux-publish doesn't support the pool
 structure yet.
