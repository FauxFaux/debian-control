Description: Run and maintains a local mirror of the Debian BTS
 Debian has a bug tracking system which files details of bugs reported
 by users and developers. Each bug is given a number, and is kept on
 file until it is marked as having been dealt with. The system is
 mainly controlled by e-mail, but the bug reports can be viewed using
 the WWW.
 .
 This package contains extra scripts necessary to create a local
 mirror of the Debian BTS and keep a local mirror up to date.
