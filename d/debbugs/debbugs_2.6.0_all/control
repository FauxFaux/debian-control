Description: bug tracking system based on the active Debian BTS
 Debian has a bug tracking system which files details of bugs reported by
 users and developers. Each bug is given a number, and is kept on file until
 it is marked as having been dealt with. The system is mainly controlled by
 e-mail, but the bug reports can be viewed using the WWW.
 .
 This version is fully functional, but it does not automatically configure.
 See /usr/share/doc/debbugs/README.Debian after installation.
 .
 Note: there might be various issues with this package, caveat emptor.
