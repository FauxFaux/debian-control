Description: modules used by the active Debian BTS
 Debian has a bug tracking system which files details of bugs reported by
 users and developers. Each bug is given a number, and is kept on file until
 it is marked as having been dealt with. The system is mainly controlled by
 e-mail, but the bug reports can be viewed using the WWW.
 .
 This package contains the perl modules used by the bug tracking
 system, some of which may be suitable for custom scripts which
 interact with local debbugs mirrors.
