Description: Debconf KDE GUI frontend tool
 Debconf KDE is a GUI library for including Debconf frontends in Qt-based
 applications.
 Debconf is a configuration management system for Debian packages, which
 is used to ask questions when they are installed.
 This library is written in C++ and used by Apper and Muon to
 embed Debconf dialogs.
 .
 This package contains a small standalone tool to display a KDE Debconf
 dialog without linking against the Debconf KDE library.
