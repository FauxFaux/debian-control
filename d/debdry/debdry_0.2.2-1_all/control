Description: Semi-assisted automatic Debian packaging
 debdry is for debian/ directories what debhelper7 is for debian/rules.
 .
 It applies the Don't Repeat Yourself idea to packaging, attempting to reuse as
 much as possible of upstream's metadata and standard packaging practices.
 .
 debdry runs an appropriate auto-debianisation tool for a given source
 directory, then applies manual overrides from a debian.in directory.
 .
 debdry supports the following types of packages (in brackets you will find
 extra packages that need to be installed for each type of package):
 .
 - Perl [dh-make-perl]
 - Python [python-stdeb, python3-stdeb]
 - Ruby [gem2deb]
 - Haskell [cabal-debian]
