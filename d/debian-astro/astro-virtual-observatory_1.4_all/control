Description: Tools and viewers for the Virtual Observatory
 This metapackage will install commonly used interfaces for interacting with
 datasets and archive data within the online distributed Virtual Observatory.
 .
 The Virtual Observatory allows astronomers to interrogate multiple data
 centers in a seamless and transparent way, provides new powerful analysis and
 visualization tools within that system, and gives data centers a standard
 framework for publishing and delivering services using their data. This is
 made possible by standardization of data and metadata, by standardization of
 data exchange methods, and by the use of a registry, which lists available
 services and what can be done with them.
 .
 When running, many of these tools can communicate with each other
 using the Simple Application Messaging Protocol (SAMP)
