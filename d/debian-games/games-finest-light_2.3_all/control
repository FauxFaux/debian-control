Description: Debian's finest games (light version)
 This metapackage will install a selection of outstanding Debian games that are
 suitable for low-end computers without hardware accelerated video cards. This
 package is also a subset of »games-finest«.
 .
 It represents almost all genres and styles. The games were chosen based on
 multiple factors namely popularity (popcon value), unique gameplay, look and
 feel, aesthetics, fun factor and a good portion of subjectivity.
 .
 Please be prepared that the installation of all games might take a while but
 it should take considerably less time than installing »games-finest«.
