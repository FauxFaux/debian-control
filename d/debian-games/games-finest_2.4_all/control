Description: Debian's finest games
 This metapackage will install a selection of outstanding Debian games
 representing almost all genres and styles. They were chosen based on multiple
 factors namely popularity (popcon value), unique gameplay, look and feel,
 aesthetics, fun factor and a good portion of subjectivity.
 .
 Please be prepared that the installation of all games might take a long time
 depending on your internet connection and hardware. Some games also require a
 hardware accelerated video card.
