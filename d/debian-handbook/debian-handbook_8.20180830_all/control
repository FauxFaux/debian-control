Description: reference book for Debian users and system administrators
 Accessible to all, the Debian Administrator's Handbook teaches the essentials
 to anyone who wants to become an effective and independent Debian GNU/Linux
 administrator.

 It covers all the topics that a competent Linux administrator should master,
 from the installation and the update of the system, up to the creation of
 packages and the compilation of the kernel, but also monitoring, backup and
 migration, without forgetting advanced topics like SELinux/AppArmor setup to
 secure services, automated installations, or virtualization with Xen, KVM or
 LXC.
 .
 The Debian Administrator's Handbook has been written by two Debian
 developers — Raphaël Hertzog and Roland Mas.
 .
 This package contains the English book covering Debian 8 “Jessie”. All
 the files are available in /usr/share/doc/debian-handbook/.
