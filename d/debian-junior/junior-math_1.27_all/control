Description: Debian Jr. educational math
 This metapackage will install educational math programs suitable for
 children.  Some of the packages use mathematics that is well beyond
 the abilities of young children (e.g. fractals and cryptography), but
 hopefully using these let them gain an appreciation of the beauty of
 math from an early age.  Other packages allow children to explore and
 learn math concepts in an engaging, interactive way.  Some packages
 are more general, providing math activities as only one part of the
 package, e.g. bsdgames includes "arithmetic" in addition to other
 non-math games, and x11-apps provides xcalc.
