Description: Debian Jr. programming
 The emphasis for this sampling of programming packages for children
 is first on simple interpreted languages.  Also important for using
 languages with children are good documentation, and some ability to
 produce visual programs without too much effort.  It is by no means
 a complete list, and you are encouraged to explore other languages
 with children as well; even those that are not specifically aimed for
 children.
 .
 The Logo language is specifically designed for children, with a strong
 emphasis on the visual and concrete.  Littlewizard is an icon-based
 graphical programming language also designed for children.
 .
 Scratch is an easy, interactive, collaborative, visual programming language
 with children from ages 8 and up as their target group.
 .
 Arduino is a popular micro controller that is widely used by both people
 learning electronics and programming as well as seasoned veterans doing
 complex projects. It is necessary to connect a physical Arduino circuit board
 in order to experiment with arduino.
