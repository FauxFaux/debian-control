Description: Debian Jr. System tools
 This package includes a few tools for helping children learn about and
 use their system.
 .
 Midnight Commander is more than just a file manager.  It is shell with
 which children can explore and manage their own accounts.  It can be a
 great help for the very young, as it saves them some typing (as
 compared with using a command-line shell directly).  It is also packed
 with power and flexibility which can be tapped by older children and
 adults alike.
 .
 The 'hello' sample program can be used as an instructional aid, as
 an example of how to invoke programs from the shell, specify switches,
 use the man page, and so on.
 .
 Baobab, the GNOME disk usage analyzer, enables the user to take a
 visual trip into the hard drive contents. It can be a mesmerizing first
 step, dvelving into the inner parts of the computer system. It serves
 both as an educational tool about file systems and file contents/size
 as well as a tool for analyzing what files are big if disk space is
 scarce.
 .
 Bubblefishymon is a computer load monitor dockapp which shows network
 traffic as fishes, CPU usage as bubbles, and a duck representing a
 duck.
