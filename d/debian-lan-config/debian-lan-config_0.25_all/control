Description: FAI config space for the Debian-LAN system
 The Debian-LAN (Debian Local Area Network) project makes running
 Debian in a local area network easy without losing flexibility.
 It may be used by schools, work groups, associations and small
 enterprises or to install complex test environments.
 .
 Debian-LAN uses FAI (Fully Automatic Installation) to install and
 configure all machines in the network.
 .
 This package contains the FAI config space.
