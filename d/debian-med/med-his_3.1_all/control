Description: Debian Med suggestions for Hospital Information Systems
 This metapackage contains dependencies for software and that could
 be useful ro run a Hospital Information System.  While there is
 continuous work going on to package a ready to install system currently
 only preconditions are finished but hopefully helpful in hospitals
 anyway.
