Description: Debian Science packages for Electrophysiology
 This metapackage will install Debian packages which might be useful for
 scientists doing electrophysiology-based neuroscience research.
 .
 The selection of packages is targeting the application of analysis
 techniques. Methods developers are referred to the
 science-statistics, science-imageanalysis, science-numericalcomputation,
 med-imaging, and med-imaging-dev metapackages for a variety of additional
 software that might be useful for electrophysiology research.
