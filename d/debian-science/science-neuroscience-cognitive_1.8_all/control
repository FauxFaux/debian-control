Description: Debian Science packages for Cognitive Neuroscience
 This metapackage will install Debian packages which might be useful for
 scientists doing cognitive neuroscience research. This comprises the full
 research process from conducting psychophysical experiments, over data
 acquisition and analysis, to visualization and typesetting of scientific
 results.
 .
 The selection of packages is targeting the application of analysis
 techniques. Methods developers are referred to the science-statistics,
 science-imageanalysis, science-numericalcomputation, med-imaging, and
 med-imaging-dev metapackages for a variety of additional software that
 might be useful in the context of cognitive neuroscience.
