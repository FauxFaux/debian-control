Description: Debian security support coverage checker
 For some Debian packages, it is not feasible to maintain full security
 support for all use cases through the full distribution release
 cycle.
 .
 This package provides a program to identify installed packages for
 which support has had to be limited or prematurely ended, and to
 alert the administrator.
 .
 New versions of this package with updated checklists will be provided
 via standard and/or extended security support.
