Description: automatic build machine for Debian source packages
 Deb-o-Matic is an easy to use build machine for Debian source packages
 based on sbuild and schroot, written in Python.
 .
 It provides a simple tool to automate build of source packages with limited
 user interaction and a simple configuration. It has some useful features such
 as automatic update of chroots, automatic scan and selection of source
 packages to build and modules support.
 .
 It is meant to help developers to build their packages without worrying too
 much of compilation, since it will run in background and no user feedback
 is required during the whole process.
