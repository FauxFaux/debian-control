Description: automatically builds and installs PEAR package as Debian packages
 With debpear, you can install PEAR packages out of only the name of a PHP PEAR
 module. Debpear will download, create, and build a Debian package out of the
 pear package that you selected, and eventually install it in your system.
 .
 The goal of debpear isn't to replace the real work of a Debian maintainer, but
 rather to allow its users to quickly build and install a PEAR package in a
 clean, Debian way, when this PEAR package doesn't exist in Debian yet.
