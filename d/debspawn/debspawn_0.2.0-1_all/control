Description: Build in nspawn containers
 Debspawn is a tool to build Debian packages in an isolated environment,
 using systemd-nspawn containers.
 By using containers, debspawn can isolate package builds from the host
 system much further, compared to traditional chroot-based build environments.
 .
 Debspawn is designed to be both easy to use by humans, as well as easy
 to integrate into an automated package build workflow.
