Description: package dependency graphs on steroids
 Very powerful and versatile tool for generating dependency graphs showing the
 relationships between .deb packages.

 for the utility 'dot' from the graphviz  package. What information is included
 in a graph can be varied using command line options.
 .
 Supported are: regular (forward) dependencies, reverse dependencies, showing
 installed packages, virtual packages, alternatives, and much more.
