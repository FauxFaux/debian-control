Description: reproducible, snapshot-based Debian rootfs builder
 A set of scripts for building reproducible Debian rootfs tarballs based on
 snapshot.debian.org, especially for the purposes of Docker base images.
 .
 The goal is to create an auditable, reproducible process for creating rootfs
 tarballs (especially for use in Docker) of Debian releases, based on
 point-in-time snapshots from snapshot.debian.org.
 .
 The only strictly Docker-specific script is debuerreotype-minimizing-config,
 which applies many configuration tweaks which are useful for Docker users and
 may or may not be useful outside of that context.
