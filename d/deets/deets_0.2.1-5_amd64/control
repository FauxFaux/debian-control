Description: decentralized model-based administration tool
 Deets provides a way to manage Debian packages and files
 on your systems using Lua-based configuration files.  A
 specialized Lua interpreter called luau is capable of
 validating your specifications and optionally enforcing
 them.
 .
 In addition, it can scan your system and generate a
 crude model configuration based on the current state
 of the Debian package database and all conffiles.
