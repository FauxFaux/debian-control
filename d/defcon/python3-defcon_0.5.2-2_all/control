Description: UFO based objects for use in font editing applications
 Defcon is a set of UFO based objects optimized for use in font
 editing applications. The objects are built to be lightweight, fast
 and flexible. The objects are very bare-bones and they are not meant
 to be end-all, be-all objects. Rather, they are meant to provide base
 functionality so that you can focus on your applicationâ€™s behavior,
 not object observing or maintaining cached data. Defcon implements
 UFO3 as described by the UFO font format.
