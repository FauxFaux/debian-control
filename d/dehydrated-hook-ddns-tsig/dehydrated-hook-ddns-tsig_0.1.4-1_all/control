Description: dehydrated dns-01 challenge response support
 This package provides a hook script to serve dns-01 challenge responses for
 dehydrated.
 .
 It uses the dnspython API to perform dynamic DNS updates, creating a temporary
 TXT record for the given domain, thereby proving ownership of the domain.
 It requires a DNS-server capable of performing dynamic DNS updates, like bind9.
 There is no need for the DNS-server to run on the local machine.
 .
 This is useful if you want to create ACME certificates for servers that do not
 serve HTTP and/or are not exposed to the public internet.
 Another important use case are wildcard certificates.
