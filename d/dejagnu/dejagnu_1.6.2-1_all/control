Description: framework for running test suites on software tools
 DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs.  Its purpose is to
 provide a single front end for all tests.
 .
 DejaGnu provides a layer of abstraction which allows you to write
 tests that are portable to any host or target where a program must
 be tested.  All tests have the same output format.
 .
 DejaGnu is written in `expect', which in turn uses "Tcl"--Tool
 command language.
