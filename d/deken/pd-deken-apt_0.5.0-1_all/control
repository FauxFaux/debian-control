Description: Externals wrangler for Pure Data (APT backend)
 deken is a simple and easy to use package manager for Pure Data (Pd).
 .
 The deken-plugin integrates with the Pd user interface, where you can search
 for externals and install them with a single click.
 .
 This addon allows one to additionally use 'apt' for installing Debian provided
 packages from within the deken-plugin (rather than downloading binaries from
 the Pure Data community website).
