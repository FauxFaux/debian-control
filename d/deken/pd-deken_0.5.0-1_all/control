Description: Externals wrangler for Pure Data
 deken is a simple and easy to use package manager for Pure Data (Pd).
 .
 The deken-plugin integrates with the Pd user interface, where you can search
 for externals and install them with a single click.
 Since Pd-0.47, the deken-plugin is integrated into Pure Data (but the Debian
 package provides an updated plugin)
 .
 Available backends that provide packages are:
  - puredata.info (downloads packages via the Pure Data community website and
    installs them into the per-user installation directory (~/pd-externals))
  - apt (installs Pd packages the Debian way; packaged as "pd-deken-apt")
