Description: Perl module to match delimited substrings
 DelimMatch allows you to match delimited substrings in a buffer. The
 delimiters can be specified with any regular expression and the start
 and end delimiters need not be the same. If the delimited text is
 properly nested, entire nested groups are returned.
 .
 In addition, you may specify quoting and escaping characters that
 contribute to the recognition of start and end delimiters.
