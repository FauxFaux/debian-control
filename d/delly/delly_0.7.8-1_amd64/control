Description: Structural variant discovery by read analysis
 Delly performs Structural variant discovery by integrated paired-end and
 split-read analysis. It discovers, genotypes and visualizes deletions,
 tandem duplications, inversions and translocations at single-nucleotide
 resolution in short-read massively parallel sequencing data. It uses
 paired-ends, split-reads and read-depth to sensitively and accurately
 delineate genomic rearrangements throughout the genome.
