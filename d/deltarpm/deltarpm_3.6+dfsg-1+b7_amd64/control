Description: Tools to create and apply deltarpms
 A deltarpm contains the differences between an old and a new version of
 an RPM. This makes it possible to recreate the new RPM from the
 deltarpm and the old RPM.
 .
 On Debian and derived systems these tools may be useful for creating
 and maintaining repositories of RPM packages.
