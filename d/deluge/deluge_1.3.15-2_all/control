Description: bittorrent client written in Python/PyGTK
 Deluge is a full-featured, multi-platform, multi-interface BitTorrent client
 using libtorrent-rasterbar in it's backend and featuring multiple
 user-interfaces: GTK+, web and console.
 .
 It has been designed using the client-server model with a daemon process that
 handles all the bittorrent activity. The Deluge daemon is able to run on
 headless machines with the user-interfaces being able to connect remotely
 from any platform.
 .
 You may want to install this package to use Deluge in classic mode,
 which means the daemon and the GTK+ user-interface are linked together.
