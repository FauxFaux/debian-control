Description: DEPS command-line tools
 Currently only contains the limited "graph-includes" tool.
 .
 Graph-includes creates a graph of dependencies between source-files
 and/or groups of source-files, with an emphasis on getting readable
 and usable graphs even for large projects.
 .
 Usability of the dependency graphs are currently improved by:
  - customizable grouping of several source files into a single node
  - transitive reduction of the graph
 .
 It currently supports graphing the C/C++ #include relationship, using
 graphviz by default.
