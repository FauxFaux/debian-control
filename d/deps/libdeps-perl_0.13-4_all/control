Description: Dependency Extraction and Processing System
 Toolkit to extract internal dependencies from a project, manipulate
 the dependency graph in arbitrary ways, and produce graphs to help in
 managing your project, including locating abusive #includes.
 .
 It aims to be fully generic and pluggable, but is still under

 customize.  Eg, you can provide your own graph transformations,
 styling rules, and graph renderers.
