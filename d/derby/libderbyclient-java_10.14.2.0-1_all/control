Description: Apache Derby Client JDBC Driver
 The Derby network client provides network connectivity to the Derby Network
 Server. It is distributed as an additional jar file, derbyclient.jar, with an
 entirely independent code base from the embedded driver.
 .
 The Derby network client is a type 4, JDBC compliant Driver, which attempts
 to match the Derby Embedded JDBC driver as much as possible.
 .
 The Derby Network Server is provided by the derby-core package.
