Description: Accelerate Diskless Workstation systems by pre-loading a dummy Desktop Session
 This package is for diskless Linux clients as you often find them in
 school class rooms running an LTSP based fat client environment.
 .
 The logon into and the initial session startup on such diskless
 workstations can be considerably slow, because all applications need to
 be fetched from one server hosting the fat clients' filesystem.
 .
 The situation gets worse, if 24 computers in the same class room get
 switched on simultaneously or the teacher tells the students to open the
 same application (e.g. Libreoffice) at the same time.
 .
 However, this issue only occurs to the first student using a diskless
 workstation that day. If the diskless machine is equipped with enough
 RAM, other students see all applications being launched within a couple
 of seconds.
 .
 Reason: once an application has been launched, it ends up in the
 diskless machine's filesystem cache in RAM.
 .
 So, this package pre-loads a desktop session of the admin's choice plus
 some extra popular applications. It does this before 7:30 in the
 morning, only. So, combine this package with Wake-On-LAN or an RTC Timer
 to make sure systems are booted before 7:30am. With such a setup in
 place, the diskless machines will have been prepared for work before the
 first students enter the class room.
