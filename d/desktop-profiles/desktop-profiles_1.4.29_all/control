Description: framework for setting up desktop profiles
 This package offers a standard cross-desktop way of managing the conditional
 activation of available profiles. As such it is useful to both administrators
 (allowing different configurations for different sets of users) and Debian
 Blends (who want to customize configuration for a certain target group).
 .
 The different Desktop environments in Debian all offer the possibility of
 customizing them through the use of profiles (sets of configuration and/or
 data files). Usually it's also possible to stack configuration sets,
 combining the customizations provided by a number of profiles.
 .
 This package currently supports profiles for KDE, GNOME, Xfce, MATE and
 Freedesktop. Freedesktop profiles allow you to do a (growing amount of)
 cross-desktop customization, while the other profile kinds allow you to
 customize the respective desktop environments to various degrees.
