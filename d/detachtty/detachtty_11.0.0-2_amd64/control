Description: Utility to connect to detached interactive programs
 Detachtty lets you run interactive programs non-interactively, and
 connect to them over the network when you do need to interact with
 them. It is somewhat similar to screen, but it is less feature-rich,
 therefore lighter and with less dependencies. It allows one to
 connect to programs running on remote hosts by mean of secure SSH
 connections.
