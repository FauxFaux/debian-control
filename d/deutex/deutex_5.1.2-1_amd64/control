Description: composition tool for doom-style WAD files
 DEU's Texture Companion (DeuTex) is a resource editor that
 can extract and insert graphics, sounds, levels and other
 resources in doom-format WAD (where's all the data?) files.
 .
 DeuTex is command-line oriented and is most useful for
 assembling WAD files as part of a build procedure, such as
 via Makefile.
