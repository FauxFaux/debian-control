Description: Device Tree Compiler for Flat Device Trees
 Device Tree Compiler, dtc, takes as input a device-tree in
 a given format and outputs a device-tree in another format
 for booting kernels on embedded systems.
 .
 Typically, the input format is "dts", a human readable source
 format, and creates a "dtb", or binary format as output.
