Description: device firmware update (DFU) based USB programmer for Atmel chips
 A Linux based command-line programmer for Atmel chips with a USB
 bootloader supporting in-system programming.
 .
 This is a mostly Device Firmware Update (DFU)-1.0-compliant
 user-space application. This program was created because the Atmel
 FLIP program for flashing devices does not run on Linux and because
 standard DFU loaders do not work for Atmel chips.
