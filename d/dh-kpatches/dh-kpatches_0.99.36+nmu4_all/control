Description: Debhelper script to help packaging kernel patches
 The dh_installkpatches script produces the "apply" and "unpatch" scripts
 that kernel-package uses to automatically handle kernel patches.  It
 provides a number of useful features like:
  * does its best to never break your kernel source tree
  * allows you to select any provided version of a patch
  * handle patch inter-dependencies
 .
 Patches are described in a Debian-standard control-file-like format.
