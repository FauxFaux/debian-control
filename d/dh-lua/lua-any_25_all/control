Description: helper script for shebang lines in Lua scripts
 Some Lua script do actually work with many, but not all, Lua versions
 in the Debian archive.  This package contains the lua-any interpreter to be
 used in the shebang lines of such scripts. lua-any reads metadata stored in
 comments in the Lua script and selects an appropriate Lua interpreter.
