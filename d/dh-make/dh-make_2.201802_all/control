Description: tool that converts source archives into Debian package source
 This package allows you to take a standard (or upstream) source package
 and convert it into a format that will allow you to build Debian packages.

 After answering a few questions, dh_make will then provide a set of
 templates that, after some small editing, will allow you to create a
 Debian package.
