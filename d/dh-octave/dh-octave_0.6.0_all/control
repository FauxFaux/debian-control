Description: Debhelper-based infrastructure for building Octave add-on packages
 Since version 3.0 of Octave (a numerical computation software),
 add-ons can be installed through the pkg.m system.  This package
 provides the infrastructure for packaging such add-ons for Debian,
 based on debhelper.  It replaces the deprecated octave-pkg-dev
 package. This package contains debhelper-like scripts for building,
 checking and cleaning the add-on package as well as for generating
 the substitution variables in debian/control.
 .
 This package is intended to be used by the Debian Octave Group
 and should be of little interest to general users.
