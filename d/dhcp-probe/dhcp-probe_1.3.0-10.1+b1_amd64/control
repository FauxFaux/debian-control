Description: network DHCP or BootP server discover
 dhcp_probe attempts to discover DHCP and BootP servers on a directly-attached
 Ethernet network. A network administrator can use this tool to locate un-
 authorized DHCP and BootP servers.
 Essentially, dhcp_probe mimics a BootP or DHCP client in a variety of
 possible states, attempting to provoke responses from servers.
