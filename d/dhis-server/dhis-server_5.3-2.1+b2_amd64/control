Description: Dynamic Host Information System - server
 DHIS is a client-server architecture meant to update databases
 for systems which are assigned a dynamic IP[v4] address.
 .
 By the means of a DHIS client a host which is assigned a dynamic
 IP address (either from its ISP or from DHCP) is able to
 communicate with a DHIS server in order to advertise its newly
 acquired IP address.
