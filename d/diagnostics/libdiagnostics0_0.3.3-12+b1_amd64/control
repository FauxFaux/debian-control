Description: Logging, unittesting, and runtime diagnostics for C++ - library
 Diagnostics is a unified framework for code annotation, logging,
 program monitoring, and unit-testing.
 .
 The annotations of diagnostics provide simple trace messages, tracing
 method entry and exit, checks (which potentially fail), asserts (which
 should never fail), invariance checking on method entry and exit, and
 a number of annotations for testing.
 .
 The annotations raise events which are can be observed and monitored.
 Using different loggers, the stream of logging events is used for
 logging or testing.
 .
 The package contains the libraries for running software linked against
 Diagnostics.
