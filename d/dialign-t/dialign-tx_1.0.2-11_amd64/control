Description: Segment-based multiple sequence alignment
 DIALIGN-TX is a command line tool to perform multiple alignment of protein or
 DNA sequences. It is a complete reimplementation of the segment-base approach
 including several new improvements and heuristics that significantly enhance
 the quality of the output alignments compared to DIALIGN 2.2 and DIALIGN-T.
 For pairwise alignment, DIALIGN-TX uses a fragment-chaining algorithm that
 favours chains of low-scoring local alignments over isolated high-scoring
 fragments. For multiple alignment, DIALIGN-TX uses an improved greedy
 procedure that is less sensitive to spurious local sequence similarities.
