Description: accelerated BLAST compatible local sequence aligner
 DIAMOND is a sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches
 and functions as a drop-in replacement for the NCBI BLAST software
 tools. It is suitable for protein-protein search as well as DNA-protein
 search on short reads and longer sequences including contigs and
 assemblies, providing a speedup of BLAST ranging up to x20,000.
