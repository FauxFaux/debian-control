Description: distributed social networking service - installer (with MySQL)
 Diaspora (currently styled diaspora* and formerly styled DIASPORA*) is a free
 personal web server that implements a distributed social networking service.
 Installations of the software form nodes (termed "pods") which make up the
 distributed Diaspora social network.
 .
 Diaspora is intended to address privacy concerns related to centralized
 social networks by allowing users to set up their own server (or "pod") to
 host content; pods can then interact to share status updates, photographs,
 and other social data. It allows its users to host their data with a
 traditional web host, a cloud-based host, an ISP, or a friend. The framework,
 which is being built on Ruby on Rails, is free software and can be
 experimented with by external developers.

 .
 This dummy package downloads diaspora (also pulling in runtime
 dependencies as rubygems) and configures it to use MySQL and  Nginx.
 .
 Unlike the normal Debian package, this package installs exact versions of the
 dependencies supported by upstream.
