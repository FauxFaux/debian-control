Description: portable DHCPv6 client
 The Dibbler client supports both stateful (i.e. IPv6 address
 granting) as well as stateless (i.e. option granting)
 auto-configuration modes of the DHCPv6 protocol. Besides basic
 capabilities, it supports various DHCPv6 extensions, for instance
 option renewal. Installing Dibbler allows obtaining IPv6 addresses and
 options from a DHCPv6 server.
