Description: portable DHCPv6 server
 The Dibbler server supports both stateful (i.e. IPv6 address
 granting) as well as stateless (i.e. options granting)
 auto-configuration modes of the DHCPv6 protocol. Relays are also
 supported. This package allows IPv6 hosts to be automatically
 configured on the network.
