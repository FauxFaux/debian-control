Description: RFC 2229 compliant modular dictionary server (documentation)
 GNU Dico is an implementation of the DICT protocol as defined in RFC 2229.
 It is fully modular: the daemon itself (dicod) provides only the server
 functionality, and knows nothing about database formats. Actual searches
 are performed by functions supplied in loadable modules. A single module
 can serve one or more databases.
 .
 This package contains the complete documentation for GNU Dico.
