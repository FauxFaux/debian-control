Description: ZIP and ZCTA database for the 2000 US Gazetteer
 This is a database of United States ZIP code information.  It
 contains a single database built from two separate sources:
 the 1990 Census ZIP code information and the 2000 Census
 ZCTA (ZIP Code Tabulation Area) information.  These
 two pieces of information together provide a nice picture
 of an area.
 The 1990 ZIP Code Information provides:
  * The name of location for each ZIP code (normally a city)
  * The other ZIP codes corresponding to the same location.
 The 2000 ZCTA information provides:
  * Total population and housing unit count in a given ZIP code
  * Total land and water area for the ZIP code
  * The state in which the ZIP code is located
  * The latitude and longitude of the ZIP code
