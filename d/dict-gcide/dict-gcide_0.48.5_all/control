Description: Comprehensive English Dictionary
 This package contains the GNU version of the Collaborative
 International Dictionary of English, formatted for use by the
 dictionary server in the dictd package.  The GCIDE contains the
 full text of the 1913 Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, supplemented by
 many definitions from WordNet, the Century Dictionary, 1906, and many
 additional definitions contributed by volunteers.
 .
 The definitions in the core of this dictionary are at least 85 years
 old, so they can not be expected to be politically correct by
 contemporary standards, and no attempt has been, or will be, made to
 make them so.
 .
 This package will be of limited use without the server found in the
 dictd package, or another RFC 2229 compliant server.
