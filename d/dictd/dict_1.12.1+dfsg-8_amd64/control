Description: dictionary client
 This package provides a client application to query a dictd server.
 The client-server protocol is TCP-based; the server may then be local or
 accessed through the network.
 .
 The DICT Development Group maintains several public servers which can
 be accessed from any machine connected to the Internet.  The default
 configuration is to query one of these servers first. This may be
 changed in the configuration file /etc/dictd/dict.conf.
 .
 Queries may be customized by numerous command line options, including
 specifying the database(s) to be queried and the search strategy to
 be used.
 .
 This package also provides dictl, which allows using UTF-8 encoded dictionaries
 with terminals that do not support UTF-8.
