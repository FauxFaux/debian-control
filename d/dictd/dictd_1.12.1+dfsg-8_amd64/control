Description: dictionary server
 This package provides a TCP-based server that allows a client to access
 dictionary definitions from a set of natural language dictionary databases.
 .
 Many dictionary databases have been packaged for use with dictd. They are
 described in the /usr/share/doc/dictd/README.Debian.gz file.
 .
 Either dict-gcide or dict-wn is essential for a useful English
 language dictionary server.  It is strongly recommended that both be
 installed.  If you are interested in computer terminology, it is
 recommended to install at least dict-jargon, dict-foldoc, or
 dict-vera.
 .
 The client program, dict, is packaged separately and is needed on all
 machines that will use the server.
