Description: Random-number generator test front-end
 dieharder is a fairly involved random number/uniform deviate generator
 tester.  It can either test any of its many prebuilt and linked
 generators (basically all of those in the GNU Scientific Library plus
 any others I've been able to find) or a potentially random dataset in a
 file.  With file input, it can test either N-bit bitstrings (with N user
 specifiable) or (double precision) floating point numbers in the range
 [0.0,1.0) (uniform deviates).  It is thus suitable for use in testing
 both software RNG's and hardware RNG's.
 .
 This package provides the command-line frontend.
