Description: Tool for reporting changes in system configuration
 This tool is run by a nightly cron job, and takes a `diff' of specified system
 configuration files and emails them to a specified email address.  Options
 to diff can be specified.  This is useful in friendly environments where there
 are multiple sysadmins working on configuration files/setups and everyone's
 changes are reported.  CVS is a better answer, but most of us don't want to
 have the hassle of putting system files in a repository.
