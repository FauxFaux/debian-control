Description: Serialize all of Python 3 (almost)
 Dill extends Python 3's 'pickle' module for serializing and
 de-serializing Python 3 objects to the majority of the built-in Python 3 types.
 Dill provides the user the same interface as the 'pickle' module, and also
 includes some additional features. In addition to pickling Python 3 objects,
 dill provides the ability to save the state of an interpreter session in a
 single command.
 Dill can be used to store Python 3 objects to a file, but the primary usage is
 to send Python 3 objects across the network as a byte stream.
