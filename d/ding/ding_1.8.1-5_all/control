Description: Graphical dictionary lookup program for Unix (Tk)
 This is "Ding"
  * a dictionary lookup program for Unix,
  * DIctionary Nice Grep,
  * a Tk based Front-End to [ae]grep, (hun|a|i)spell, dict, ...
  * Ding {n} :: thing
 .
 This package needs tre-agrep(1), agrep(1) or egrep(1) as a back end.
 (tre-)agrep is preferable, because it supports fault tolerant
 searching.
 .
 You have to install some translation dictionary word list with a
 word/phrase in two languages in one line with some kind of separator
 between them.  The default configuration of ding uses the
 German-English dictionary which can be found in the trans-de-en
 package, but you can use every other translation word lists with one
 entry per line.
