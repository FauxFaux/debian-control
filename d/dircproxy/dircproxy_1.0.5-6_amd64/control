Description: IRC proxy for people who use IRC from different workstations
 dircproxy is an IRC proxy server designed for people who use
 IRC from lots of different workstations or clients, but wish to
 remain connected and see what they missed while they were away.
 You connect to IRC through dircproxy, and it keeps you connected
 to the server, even after you detach your client from it.
 While you're detached, it logs channel and private messages
 as well as important events, and when you re-attach it'll let
 you know what you missed.
 .
 This can be used to give you roughly the same functionality as
 using ircII and screen together, except you can use whatever
 IRC client you like, including X ones!
