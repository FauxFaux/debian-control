Description: Display and merge changes between two directory trees
 Dirdiff can handle up to 5 trees.  It displays a main window with a
 list of the files which are different between the trees, with colored
 squares to indicate the relative ages of the versions.  A menu allows
 you to display the differences between any two of the versions in
 another window.  Another menu allows you to copy the file from one
 tree to another.
