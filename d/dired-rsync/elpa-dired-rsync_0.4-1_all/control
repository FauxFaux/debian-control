Description: support for rsync from Emacs dired buffers
 This package adds a single command dired-rsync which allows the user
 to copy marked files in a dired buffer via rsync. This is useful,
 especially for large files, because the copy happens in the
 background and doesnâ€™t lock up Emacs. It is also more efficient than
 using TRAMP's own encoding methods for moving data between systems.
