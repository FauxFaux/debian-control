Description: monitors events in the file system directories
 For each event that occurs in a set of pre-configured directories, the
 program calls an external program associated with it, supplying it with
 the information about the event and the location within the file system
 where it occurred. This may be helpful, for example, to track changes in
 the important configuration files.
