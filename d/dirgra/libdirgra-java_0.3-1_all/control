Description: Java library providing a simple directed graph implementation
 A directed graph (or digraph) is a graph (that is a set of vertices
 connected by edges), where the edges have a direction associated with
 them.

 This library is currently used in JRuby implementation but it's perfectly
 reusable for any other project requiring this kind of data structures.
