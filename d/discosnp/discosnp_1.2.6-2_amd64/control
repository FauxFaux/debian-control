Description: discovering Single Nucleotide Polymorphism from raw set(s) of reads
 Software discoSnp is designed for discovering Single Nucleotide
 Polymorphism (SNP) from raw set(s) of reads obtained with Next Generation
 Sequencers (NGS).
 .
 Note that number of input read sets is not constrained, it can be one, two,
 or more. Note also that no other data as reference genome or annotations
 are needed.
 .
 The software is composed by two modules. First module, kissnp2, detects SNPs
 from read sets. A second module, kissreads, enhance the kissnp2 results by
 computing per read set  and for each found SNP:
 .
  1) its mean read coverage
  2) the (phred) quality of reads generating the polymorphism.
 .
 This program is superseded by DiscoSnp++.
