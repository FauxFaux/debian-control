Description: diligence/distributed shell for parallel sysadmin
 Dish executes commands simultaneously on several systems via 'ssh', 'rsh',
 'telnet', 'mysql', or any user-defined command-line connection client.
 It makes easy the distribution of files by 'scp' and 'rcp', but also a remote
 password change or operations requiring authentication by multiple passwords.
 Dish can be used as a flexible tool for managing large number of various types
 of hosts such as (clustered) servers, switches, databases, etc.
