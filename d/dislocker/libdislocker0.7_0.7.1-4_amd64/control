Description: read/write encrypted BitLocker volumes (shared library)
 Dislocker has been designed to read BitLocker encrypted partitions under
 a Linux system. The driver used to read volumes encrypted in Windows system
 versions of the Vista to 10 and BitLocker-To-Go encrypted partitions,that's
 USB/FAT32 partitions.
 .
 The software works with driver composed of a library, with multiple binaries
 using this library. Decrypting the partition, you have to give it a mount
 point where, once keys are decrypted, a file named dislocker-file appears.
 This file is a virtual NTFS partition, so you can mount it as any NTFS
 partition and then read from or write to it. Writing to the NTFS virtual
 file will change the underlying BitLocker partition content.
 .
 This package provides the runtime library.
