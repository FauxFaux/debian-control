Description: fortune-like collection of Buddhist sayings
 This program displays a random verse from the English or Polish translations of
 the Dhammapada, a "versified Buddhist scripture traditionally ascribed to the
 Buddha himself" (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhammapada).
 .
 As this program works similarly to fortune, one may use it in shell profiles
 or .sig generators, among others.
