Description: pump mode for distcc a distributed compiler client and server
 distcc is a program to distribute compilation of C or C++ code across
 several machines on a network. distcc should always generate the same
 results as a local compile, is simple to install and use, and is often
 significantly faster than a local compile.  distcc does not require all
 machines to share a filesystem, have synchronized clocks, or to have
 the same libraries or header files installed.
 .
 this package contains the necessary additions for distcc's "pump" mode,
 which improves on plain distcc by distributing not only compilation but
 also preprocessing to distcc servers.
 If you have more than 10 CPUs involved in your distcc setup, you should
 consider using this package on your distcc client machine.
