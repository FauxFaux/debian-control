Description: pump mode for distcc a distributed compiler client and server
 distcc is a program to distribute compilation of C or C++ code across
 several machines on a network. distcc should always generate the same
 results as a local compile, is simple to install and use, and is often
 significantly faster than a local compile. distcc does not require all
 machines to share a filesystem, have synchronized clocks, or to have
 the same libraries or header files installed.
 .
 this package contains the necessary additions for distcc's "pump" mode,
 which improves on plain distcc by distributing not only compilation but
 also preprocessing to distcc servers.
 .
 If you have more than 10 CPUs involved in your distcc setup, you should
 consider using this package on your distcc client machine.
