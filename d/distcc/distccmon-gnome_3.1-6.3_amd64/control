Description: GTK+ monitor for distcc a distributed client and server
 distcc is a program to distribute compilation of C or C++ code across
 several machines on a network. distcc should always generate the same
 results as a local compile, is simple to install and use, and is often
 significantly faster than a local compile.  distcc does not require all
 machines to share a filesystem, have synchronized clocks, or to have
 the same libraries or header files installed.
 .
 this is the GTK+ monitor program.
