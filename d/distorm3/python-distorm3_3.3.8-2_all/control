Description: powerful disassembler library for x86/AMD64 binary streams (Python bindings)
 diStorm3 is a binary stream disassembler library project.
 .
 With diStorm3, no more parsing strings is needed. diStorm3 is really a
 decomposer, which means it takes an instruction and returns a binary
 structure which describes it rather than static text. This is great for
 advanced binary code analysis.
 .
 This package provides the Python bindings.
