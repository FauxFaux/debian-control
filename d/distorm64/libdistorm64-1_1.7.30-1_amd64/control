Description: ultimate disassembler library for x86 code
 Distorm64 is a fast disassembler library for the x86-64 instruction set.  Main
 features are:
  - It's really fast.
  - It supports multi-threading.
  - It supports AMD64, and all other 80x86 instruction sets.
  - It supports up to date instruction sets, such as VMX and SSE4.
  - It handles instruction prefixes in a serious manner.
  - Unused/extra prefixes are dropped (output as DB'ed).
  - Lock prefix works only on lockable instructions if the first operand is in
 the form of memory indirection.
  - REPn/z prefix works only on repeatable string instructions as well as I/O
 instructions.
  - Segment Override prefixes are possible where memory indirection address is
 being used (and specially treated with string and I/O instructions).
  - Some SSE2 instructions support pseudo opcodes (CMP family).
  - "Native" instructions, those which have the same mnemonic in different
 decoding modes, unless there's an operand size prefix, which then a suffix
 letter is concatenated to the mnemonic in order to indicate the operation size
 (instructions like: PUSHA, IRET, etc.).
  - XLAT instruction is treated specially when prefixed.
  - Drops invalid instructions when their operands are invalid.
  - Won't decode instructions which are longer than 15 bytes.
  - CR8 register is now accessible using the Lock prefix in 32 bits decoding
 mode.
  - In 64-bit decoding mode the Segment Override prefixes CS, DS, ES and SS are
 ignored.
