Description: Graphics demo that makes you dizzy using rotating textures
 dizzy is a graphics demo that rotates planes of patterns on a colored
 background to make you dizzy. Textures can be cross-faded and there is a mode
 that automatically changes textures, allowing dizzy to be run as a
 screensaver.
