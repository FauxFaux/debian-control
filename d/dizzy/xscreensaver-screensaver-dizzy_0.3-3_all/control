Description: Graphics demo that makes you dizzy (XScreenSaver hack)
 dizzy is a graphics demo that rotates planes of patterns on a colored
 background to make you dizzy. Textures can be cross-faded and there is a mode
 that automatically changes textures, allowing dizzy to be run as a
 screensaver.
 .
 This package integrates dizzy with XScreenSaver, but it cannot be done
 automatically. See /usr/share/doc/xscreensaver-screensaver-dizzy/README.Debian
 for details on the configuration.
