Description: Serve production static files with Django (Python 3)
 This is a simple Django middleware utility that allows you to
 properly serve static assets from production with a WSGI server
 like Gunicorn.
 .
 Django doesnâ€™t recommend the production use of its static file
 server for a number of reasons. There exists, however, a lovely
 WSGI application aptly named Static.
 .
 It is suitable for the production use of static file serving,
 unlike Django.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
