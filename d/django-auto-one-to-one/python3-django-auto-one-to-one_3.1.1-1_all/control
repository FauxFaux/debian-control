Description: Django module to connect child model instances to parent class
 This module for the Django web development framework automatically creates
 "child" model instances when a parent class is created.
 .
 This is very useful when associating more information with one of the Django
 internal models (such as the built-in User) but also to separate concerns
 across an entire Django project.
