Description: databased-backed work queue for Django
 Django Background Task is a databased-backed work queue for Django,
 loosely based around Ruby's DelayedJob library. This project was
 adopted and adapted from lilspikey django-background-task.
 .
 To avoid conflicts on PyPI this packaged was renamed it to
 django-background-tasks (plural). For an easy upgrade from
 django-background-task to django-background-tasks, the internal
 module structure were left untouched.
 .
 In Django Background Task, all tasks are implemented as functions (or
 any other callable).
 .
 There are two parts to using background tasks:
  * creating the task functions and registering them with the
  * scheduler setup a cron task (or long running process) to execute the
    tasks
