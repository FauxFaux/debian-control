Description: efficient static file serving with Django (Python3 version)
 django-downloadview makes it easy to serve files with Django:
 .
  * manage files with Django (permissions, filters, generation, ...);
  * files are stored somewhere or generated somehow (local filesystem,
    remote storage, memory...);
  * django-downloadview helps to stream the files with very little
    code;
  * django-downloadview helps to improve performances with reverse
    proxies, via mechanisms such as Nginx’s X-Accel or Apache’s
    X-Sendfile.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the library.
