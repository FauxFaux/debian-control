Description: Django friendly finite state machine support (Python3 version)
 django-fsm adds declarative states management for django models. Instead of
 adding some state field to a django model, and managing its values by hand,
 you could use FSMState field and mark model methods with the transition
 decorator. Your method could contain the side-effects of the state change.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the library.
