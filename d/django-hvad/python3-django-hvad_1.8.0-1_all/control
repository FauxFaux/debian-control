Description: Painless translations in Django
 Painless translations in django, using the regular ORM. Integrates
 easily into existing projects and apps. Easy convertible from
 django-multilingual-ng.
 .
 This project adds support for model translations in Django. It is
 designed to be unobtrusive, efficient and reliable. On the technical
 side, it uses an automatically created Translations Model to store
 translatable fields in arbitrary languages with a foreign key to the
 main model, enabling fast queries.
 .
 Started in 2011, hvad has grown mature and is now used on large scale
 applications.
