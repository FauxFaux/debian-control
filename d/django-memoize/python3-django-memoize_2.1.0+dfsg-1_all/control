Description: implementation of memoization technique for Django (Python 3)
 django-memoize is an implementation of the memoization technique for Django.
 You can think of it as a cache for function or method results.
 .
 In memoization, the functions arguments are also included into the cache_key.
 Memoize is also designed for methods, since it will take into account the repr
 of the ‘self’ or ‘cls’ argument as part of the cache key. The theory behind
 memoization is that if you have a function you need to call several times in
 one request, it would only be calculated the first time that function is
 called with those arguments.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version of the package.
