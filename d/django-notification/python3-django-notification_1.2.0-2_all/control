Description: user notification management for Django (Python 3 version)
 Many sites need to notify users when certain events have
 occurred and to allow configurable options as to how those
 notifications are to be received, including:
 .
  * submission of notification messages by other apps
  * notification messages on signing in
  * notification messages via email (configurable by user)
  * notification messages via feed
 .
 This package is for Python3.
