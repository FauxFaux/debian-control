Description: Seamless Polymorphic Inheritance for Django Models
 Django-polymorphic simplifies using inherited models in Django projects. When a
 query is made at the base model, the inherited model classes are returned.
 .
 Features:
  * Full admin integration.
  * ORM integration:
    + Support for ForeignKey, ManyToManyField, OneToOneField descriptors.
    + Support for proxy models.
    + Filtering/ordering of inherited models (ArtProject___artist).
    + Filtering model types: instance_of(...) and not_instance_of(...)
    + Combining querysets of different models (qs3 = qs1 | qs2)
    + Support for custom user-defined managers.
  * Uses the minimum amount of queries needed to fetch the inherited models.
  * Disabling polymorphic behavior when needed.
