Description: Django middlewares to enable monitoring with Prometheus (Python 2)
 The django-prometheus library provides integrations to monitor database
 interaction, usage of models, and HTTP requests. Any custom metrics are also
 handled directly by the Python Prometheus client library.
 .
 This library just facilitates gathering and exporting the data. A separate
 service (or set of services) must be used to gather, store and process this
 data.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 library.
