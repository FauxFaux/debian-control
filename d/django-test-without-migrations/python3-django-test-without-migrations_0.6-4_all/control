Description: Disable migrations when running your tests (Python 3)
 Test Without Migrations is a manage.py test command extension.
 .
 The Django 1.7 and 1.8 migration backend demands that you
 create a migration every time you change a model.
 .
 This can be inconvenient when you’re just trying to explore
 your models code.
 .
 In older Django versions, with South you could use the
 SOUTH_TEST_MIGRATIONS settings to tell Django to simply create
 all model tables without running migrations.
 .
 This app adds this capability to Django by extending the
 'manage.py test' command with a –nomigrations option.
 .
 Test Without Migrations works with Django 1.7+.
