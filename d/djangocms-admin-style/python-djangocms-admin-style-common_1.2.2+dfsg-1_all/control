Description: CSS styles for the django CMS admin interface (common assets)
 django CMS is a modern web publishing platform built with Django. It offers
 out-of-the-box support for the common features expected from a CMS, but can
 also be easily customised and extended by developers to create a site that is
 tailored to their precise needs.
 .
 django CMS is a well-tested CMS platform that powers sites both large and
 small. Here are a few of the key features:
  * robust internationalisation (i18n) support for creating multilingual sites
  * virtually unlimited undo history, allowing editors to revert to a previous
    version
  * front-end editing, providing rapid access to the content management
    interface
  * support for a variety of editors with advanced text editing features
  * a flexible plugins system that lets developers put powerful tools at the
    fingertips of editors, without overwhelming them with a difficult interface
 .
 This package contains the common assets of the admin styles required by
 django CMS.
