Description: Web APIs for Django, made easy (documentation)
 powerful and flexible toolkit that makes it easy to build Web APIs.
 Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:
  * The Web browseable API is a huge useability win for your developers.
  * Authentication policies including OAuth1a and OAuth2 out of the box.
  * Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.
  * Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if you
    don't need the more powerful features.
