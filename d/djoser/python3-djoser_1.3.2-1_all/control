Description: REST implementation of Django authentication system (Python3 version)
 Djoser library provides a set of Django Rest Framework views to handle basic
 actions such as registration, login, logout, password reset and account
 activation. It works with custom user model.
 .
 Instead of reusing Django code (e.g. PasswordResetForm), it reimplementes a few
 things to fit better into a Single Page App architecture.
 .
 Supported authentication backends are:
  * HTTP Basic Auth (Default)
  * Token based authentication from Django Rest Framework
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the library.
