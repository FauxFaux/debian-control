Description: DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) milter in Python
 The dkimpy-milter is a Sendmail/Postfix Milter application that signs
 and verifies DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail).  It supports both traditional
 RSA (RFC 6376) signatures and the new ed25519 based signatures being
 developed by the IETF DCRUP (DKIM Crypto UPgrade) Working Group.
 .
 DKIM provides a way for senders to confirm their identity when sending email
 by adding a cryptographic signature to the headers of the message.
 .
 It uses the OpenDKIM configuration option naming and definitions, for the
 options it implements, to make it easy for OpenDKIM users to experiment with
 this alternative.
