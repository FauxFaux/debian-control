Description: Utility functions for higher level dLeyna components
 dleyna-core is a library of utility functions that are used by the higher
 level dLeyna libraries that communicate with DLNA devices, e.g.,
 dleyna-server. In brief, it provides APIs for logging, error, settings and
 task management and an IPC abstraction API.

 dLeyna is an umbrella project hosting a number of middleware components
 designed to make it easy for developers to integrate DLNA functionality into
 their applications.
