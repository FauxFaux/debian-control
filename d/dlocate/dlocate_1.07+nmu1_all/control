Description: fast alternative to dpkg -L and dpkg -S
 Uses GNU grep and text dumps of dpkg's data to greatly speed up finding out which
 package a file belongs to (i.e. a very fast dpkg -S). Many other uses,
 including options to view all files in a package, calculate disk space
 used, view and check md5sums, list man pages, etc.
