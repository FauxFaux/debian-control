Description: Diagnostic Log and Trace logging daemon
 This component provides a log and trace interface, based on the standardised
 protocol specified in the AUTOSAR standard 4.0 DLT. This software can be used
 by GENIVI components and other applications as logging facility.
 .
 The DLT daemon is the central component in GENIVI, which gathers all logs and
 traces from the DLT user applications. The logs and traces can optionally
 be directly written to a file in the ECU. The DLT daemon forwards all logs
 and traces to a connected DLT client. The DLT client can send control
 messages to the daemon, e.g. to set individual log levels of applications
 and contexts or get the list of applications and contexts registered in the
 DLT daemon.
