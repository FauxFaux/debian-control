Description: Diagnostic Log and Trace (DLT) (documentation)
 This component provides a log and trace interface, based on the standardised
 protocol specified in the AUTOSAR standard 4.0 DLT. This software can be used
 by GENIVI components and other applications as logging facility.
 .
 This package includes tools to connect to and experiment with DLT daemon.
 Most usefully this includes 'dlt-receive' to connect to a (remote) DLT server
 and save all logs to a DLT file and 'dlt-system' that injects system logs
 into the DLT server
