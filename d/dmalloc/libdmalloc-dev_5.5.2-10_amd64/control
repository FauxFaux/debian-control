Description: debug memory allocation library (development files and doc)
 Drop in replacement for the system's `malloc', `realloc', `calloc', `free' and
 other memory management routines while providing powerful debugging facilities

 These facilities include such things as memory-leak tracking, fence-post write
 detection, file/line number reporting, and general logging of statistics.
