Description: debug memory allocation library
 Drop in replacement for the system's `malloc', `realloc', `calloc', `free' and
 other memory management routines while providing powerful debugging facilities
 configurable at runtime.
 .
 These facilities include such things as memory-leak tracking, fence-post write
 detection, file/line number reporting, and general logging of statistics.
 .
 This package contains only the shared libraries, the development files and
 documentation is in the libdmalloc-dev package.
