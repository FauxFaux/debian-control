Description: Debug package for dmtcp
 DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing) is a tool to transparently
 checkpointing the state of an arbitrary group of programs including
 multi-threaded and distributed computations.  It operates directly on the user
 binary executable, with no Linux kernel modules or other kernel mods.
 .
 Among the applications supported by DMTCP are Open MPI, MATLAB, Python, Perl,
 and many programming languages and shell scripting languages.  DMTCP also
 supports GNU screen sessions, including vim/cscope and emacs. With the use of
 TightVNC, it can also checkpoint and restart X-Window applications, as long
 as they do not use extensions (e.g.: no OpenGL, no video).
 .
 This package contains debugging symbols for DMTCP.
