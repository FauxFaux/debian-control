Description: Base package for Linux DECnet
 This is the base package for Linux DECnet. It contains the necessary
 configuration files and a script to set up the MAC address of your
 Ethernet card(s) at boot-up.
 .
 You will also need to be running a 2.4+ kernel and have DECnet either
 built as a module or compiled into the kernel.
 .
 To do useful work with DECnet you will need the libdnet package and
 probably also dnet-progs.
