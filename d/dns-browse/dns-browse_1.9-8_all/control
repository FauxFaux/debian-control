Description: Front-ends to DNS search
 This package provides two programs to make user lookups on DNS
 servers: dns_tree and dns_browse.
 .
 dns_tree is a command-line-based front-end to dig.  It replaces the
 several dig invocations necessary to fetch a zone, and it formats the
 output in a somewhat sensible hierarchical style (a tree).
 .
 dns_browse is a GUI front-end to dns_tree.  It allows point-and-click
 DNS browsing and makes it easy to expand/compress hierarchies in one
 or more DNS zones.
