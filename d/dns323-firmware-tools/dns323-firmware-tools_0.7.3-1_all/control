Description: build and manipulate firmware images for a range of NAS devices
 This package contains programs for manipulating the firmware images used by
 a range of small consumer-grade NAS devices, such as the D-Link DNS-323.
 .
 These firmware images are what are used to "bundle" the kernel, initrd, and
 other data when uploading new firmware images using the "stock" interface.
 If you are already running a custom firmware, it is likely that these tools
 will be of no use to you, and you will need to use whatever update
 mechanism is provided by your firmware.
