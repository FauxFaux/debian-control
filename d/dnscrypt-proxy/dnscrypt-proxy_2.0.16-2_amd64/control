Description: Tool for securing communications between a client and a DNS resolver
 dnscrypt-proxy provides local service which can be used directly as your local
 resolver or as a DNS forwarder, encrypting and authenticating requests using
 the DNSCrypt protocol and passing them to an upstream server.
 .
 The DNSCrypt protocol uses high-speed high-security elliptic-curve
 cryptography and is very similar to DNSCurve, but focuses on securing
 communications between a client and its first-level resolver.
 .
 While not providing end-to-end security, it protects the local network, which
 is often the weakest point of the chain, against man-in-the-middle attacks. It
 also provides some confidentiality to DNS queries.
