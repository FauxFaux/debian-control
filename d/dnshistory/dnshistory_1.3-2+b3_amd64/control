Description: Translating and storing of IP addresses from log files
 Provide a means for storing a history of DNS/Name changes for the IP Addresses
 extracted from web log files. The major target being that multiple analyses of
 older log files do not require re-lookups of IP Address to FQDNs, and
 additionally maintain the accuracy of the lookup as it was then and not as it
 is now.
