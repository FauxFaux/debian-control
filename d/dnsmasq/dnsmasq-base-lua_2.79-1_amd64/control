Description: Small caching DNS proxy and DHCP/TFTP server
 This package contains the dnsmasq executable and documentation, but
 not the infrastructure required to run it as a system daemon. For
 that, install the dnsmasq package. This package is an alternative
 to dnsmasq-base which includes the LUA interpreter.
