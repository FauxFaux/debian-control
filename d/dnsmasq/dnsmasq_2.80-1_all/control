Description: Small caching DNS proxy and DHCP/TFTP server
 Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure, DNS forwarder and DHCP
 server. It is designed to provide DNS and optionally, DHCP, to a
 small network. It can serve the names of local machines which are
 not in the global DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS
 server and allows machines with DHCP-allocated addresses
 to appear in the DNS with names configured either in each host or
 in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic
 DHCP leases and BOOTP/TFTP for network booting of diskless machines.
