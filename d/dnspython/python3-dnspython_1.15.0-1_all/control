Description: DNS toolkit for Python 3
 dnspython is a DNS toolkit for Python. It supports almost all record types. It
 can be used for queries, zone transfers, and dynamic updates. It supports TSIG
 authenticated messages and EDNS0.
 .
 dnspython provides both high and low level access to DNS. The high level
 classes perform queries for data of a given name, type, and class, and return
 an answer set. The low level classes allow direct manipulation of DNS zones,
 messages, names, and records.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version.
