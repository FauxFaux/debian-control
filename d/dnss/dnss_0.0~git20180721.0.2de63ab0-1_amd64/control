Description: Daemon for encapsulating DNS over HTTPS
 dnss is a daemon for encapsulating DNS over HTTPS.
 .
 It can act as a DNS-to-HTTPS proxy, using https://dns.google.com as a server
 or anything implementing the same API.
 .
 It can also act as an HTTPS-to-DNS proxy, implementing the same HTTP API; you
 can use this instead of https://dns.google.com if you want more control over
 the servers and the final DNS server used (for example if you are in an
 isolated environment, such as a test lab or a private network).
