Description: RFC documents metapackage
 RFC (Request for Comments) documents are a series of technical and
 organizational notes about the Internet. They are edited by the
 Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
 .
 This is a metapackage that pulls in the new doc-rfc-xxx packages
 (those that most closely correspond to the old doc-rfc package).
 .
 It can be removed if users want just a subset of the RFCs.
