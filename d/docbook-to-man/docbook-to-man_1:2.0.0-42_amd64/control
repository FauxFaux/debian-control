Description: converter from DocBook SGML into roff man macros
 docbook-to-man is a batch converter that transforms UNIX-style manpages from
 the DocBook SGML format into nroff/troff man macros.
 .
 This is not the original version by Fred Dalrymple, but one with the
 modifications by David Bolen.
 .
 docbook-to-man lacks support for internationalization and utf-8. Other
 tools like docbook2man or docbook-xml with xsltproc are better suited for
 new projects.
