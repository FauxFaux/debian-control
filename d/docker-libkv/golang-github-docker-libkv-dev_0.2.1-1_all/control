Description: Key/Value store abstraction library
 libkv provides a Go native library to store metadata.
 .
 The goal of libkv is to abstract common store operations for multiple
 Key/Value backends and offer the same experience no matter which backend
 is used.
 .
 For example, libkv can be used it to store metadata or for service
 discovery to register machines and endpoints inside your cluster.
 .
 Also libkv can be used to implement a generic Leader Election.
 .
 As of now, libkv offers support for Consul (disabled), Etcd and Zookeeper.
