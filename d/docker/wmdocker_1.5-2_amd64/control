Description: System tray for KDE3/GNOME2 docklet applications
 Docker is a docking application (WindowMaker dock app) which acts as a system
 tray for any desktop environment, allowing you to have a system tray without
 running the KDE/GNOME panel Docker was designed to work with Openbox 2, but it
 should work fine in any window manager.
