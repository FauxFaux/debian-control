Description: C++11 port of docopt
 With docopt, the option parser is generated based on the program's docstring.
 docopt parses the usage pattern ("Usage: ...") and option descriptions (lines
 starting with dash "-") and ensures that the program invocation matches the
 usage pattern. It parses options, arguments and commands based on that. The
 basic idea is that a good help message has all necessary information in it to
 make a parser.
 .
 This is a port of the docopt Python module to C++ with a focus on maintaining
 full feature parity (and code structure) as the original. The differences from
 the Python port are:
 .
   - The addition of a docopt_parse function, which does not terminate the
     program on error a docopt::value type to hold the various value types that
     can be parsed.
 .
   - Because C++ is statically-typed and Python is not, some changes were made
     to the interfaces of the internal parse tree types.
 .
   - Because std::regex does not have an equivalent to Python's regex.split,
     some of the regex's had to be restructured and additional loops used.
 .
 This package provides the shared libraries.
