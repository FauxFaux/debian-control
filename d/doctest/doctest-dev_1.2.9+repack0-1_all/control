Description: Light and feature-rich C++ testing framework
 doctest is a light and feature-rich C++98 / C++11 single-header testing
 framework for unit tests and TDD.
 .
 It is inspired by the unittest {} functionality of the D programming
 language and Python's docstrings - tests can be considered a form of
 documentation and should be able to reside near the production code
 which they test. This isn't possible (or at least practical) with any
 other testing framework for C++.
