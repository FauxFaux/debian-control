Description: tool for object-relational mapping
 Object-Relational-Mapper for PHP.
 Doctrine 2 is an object-relational mapper (ORM) for PHP that provides
 transparent persistence for PHP objects. It sits on top of a powerful
 database abstraction layer (DBAL). One of its key features is the
 option to write database queries in a proprietary object oriented SQL
 dialect called Doctrine Query Language (DQL), inspired by Hibernates
 HQL. This provides developers with a powerful alternative to SQL that
 maintains flexibility without requiring unnecessary code duplication.
 .
 The Doctrine Project provides several libraries primarily focused on
 database storage and object mapping.
