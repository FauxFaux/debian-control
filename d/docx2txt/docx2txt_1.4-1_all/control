Description: Convert Microsoft OOXML files to plain text
 This tool attempts to generate equivalent plain text files from
 Microsoft .docx documents, preserving some formatting and document
 information (which MS text conversion drops) along with appropriate
 character conversions for a good (ascii or utf-8) text experience.
 It is a platform independent solution consisting of (core) Perl and
 (wrapper) Unix/Windows shell scripts and a configuration file to
 control the output text appearance to a fair extent.  It can very
 conveniently be used to build a Web-based docx document conversion
 service.  Some Makefiles and Windows batch files are provided for
 easy installation of the scripts.  With unzippers like CakeCmd that
 can deal with corrupt Zip archives, this tool can extract text from
 corrupt docx documents in many cases, where MS Word fails to even
 open them.
