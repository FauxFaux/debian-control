Description: searches for dodgy looking lines in Python code
 Dodgy is a very basic tool to run against your codebase to search for "dodgy"
 looking values. It is a series of simple regular expressions designed to detect
 things such as accidental SCM diff checkins, or passwords or secret keys hard
 coded into files.
