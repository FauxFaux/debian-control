 The Dogtag Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Suite is comprised of the following
 five subsystems and a client (for use by a Token Management System):

   * Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Manager
   * Token Key Service (TKS)

 of the Dogtag API, as well as various command-line tools used to assist with
 a PKI deployment.
