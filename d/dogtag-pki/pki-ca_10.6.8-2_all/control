Description: Certificate System - Certificate Authority
 The Certificate Authority (CA) is a required PKI subsystem which issues,
 renews, revokes, and publishes certificates as well as compiling and
 publishing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).
 .
 The Certificate Authority can be configured as a self-signing Certificate
 Authority, where it is the root CA, or it can act as a subordinate CA,
 where it obtains its own signing certificate from a public CA.
 .
 This package is a part of the PKI Core used by the Certificate System.
