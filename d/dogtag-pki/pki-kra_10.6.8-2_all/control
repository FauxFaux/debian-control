Description: Certificate System - Data Recovery Manager
 Certificate System (CS) is an enterprise software system designed
 to manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.
 .
 The Data Recovery Manager (DRM) is an optional PKI subsystem that can act
 as a Key Recovery Authority (KRA).  When configured in conjunction with the
 Certificate Authority (CA), the DRM stores private encryption keys as part of
 the certificate enrollment process.  The key archival mechanism is triggered
 when a user enrolls in the PKI and creates the certificate request.  Using the
 Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) request format, a request is
 generated for the user's private encryption key.  This key is then stored in
 the DRM which is configured to store keys in an encrypted format that can only
 be decrypted by several agents requesting the key at one time, providing for
 protection of the public encryption keys for the users in the PKI deployment.
 .
 Note that the DRM archives encryption keys; it does NOT archive signing keys,
 since such archival would undermine non-repudiation properties of signing keys.
