Description: Certificate System - Token Processing System
 Certificate System (CS) is an enterprise software system designed
 to manage enterprise Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) deployments.
 .
 The Token Processing System (TPS) is an optional PKI subsystem that acts
 as a Registration Authority (RA) for authenticating and processing
 enrollment requests, PIN reset requests, and formatting requests from
 the Enterprise Security Client (ESC).
 .
 TPS is designed to communicate with tokens that conform to
 Global Platform's Open Platform Specification.
 .
 TPS communicates over SSL with various PKI backend subsystems (including
 the Certificate Authority (CA), the Data Recovery Manager (DRM), and the
 Token Key Service (TKS)) to fulfill the user's requests.
 .
 TPS also interacts with the token database, an LDAP server that stores
 information about individual tokens.
