Description: JavaScript compression system
 ShrinkSafe is a JavaScript compression system. It can typically reduce the
 size of your scripts by a third or more, depending on your programming style.
 .
 Many other tools also shrink JavaScript files, but ShrinkSafe is different.
 Instead of relying on brittle regular expressions, ShrinkSafe is based on
 Rhino, a JavaScript interpreter. This allows ShrinkSafe to transform the source
 of a file with much more confidence that the resulting script will function
 identically to the file you uploaded.
