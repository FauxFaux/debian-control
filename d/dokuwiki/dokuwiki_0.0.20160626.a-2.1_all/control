Description: standards compliant simple to use wiki
 DokuWiki is a wiki mainly aimed at creating documentation of any kind.
 It is targeted at developer teams, workgroups and small companies. It
 has a simple but powerful syntax which makes sure the datafiles remain
 readable outside the wiki and eases the creation of structured texts.
 All data is stored in plain text files -- no database is required.
