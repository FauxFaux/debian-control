Description: One Time Password calculator
 Donkey is an alternative for S/KEY's "key" command.  This means that donkey
 is also an alternative for "keyinit".  Since the entry is printed to stdout
 (not to /etc/skeykeys), you can easily send it to a remote operator by e-mail
 (with a PGP signature or something). So, it is possible to initiate S/KEY
 without logging onto the console of the host.
