Description: Desktop Search Engine (debug)
 It searches your hard drive for files using pattern matching on meta-data. It
 extracts file-format specific meta-data using libextractor and builds a suffix
 tree to index the files. The index can then be searched rapidly. It is similar
 to locate, but can take advantage of information such as ID3 tags. It is
 possible to do full-text indexing using the appropriate libextractor plugins.
 It also supports using FAM to keep the database up-to-date.
 .
 This package contains the debugging symbols.
