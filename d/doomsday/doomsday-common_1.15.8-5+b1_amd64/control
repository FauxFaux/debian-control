Description: enhanced version of the legendary DOOM game - common files
 The purpose of the Doomsday Engine project is to create versions of DOOM,
 Heretic and Hexen that feel the same as the original games but are implemented
 using modern techniques such as 3D graphics and client/server networking. A
 lot of emphasis is placed on good-looking graphics.
 .
 This package includes files common to both server and client packages.
