Description: enhanced version of the legendary DOOM game
 The purpose of the Doomsday Engine project is to create versions of DOOM,
 Heretic and Hexen that feel the same as the original games but are implemented
 using modern techniques such as 3D graphics and client/server networking. A
 lot of emphasis is placed on good-looking graphics.
 .
 Doomsday Engine (or deng for short) requires an IWAD to play. You can install
 your commercial IWADs using game-data-packager.
