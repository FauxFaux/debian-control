Description: drug-dealing game set in streets of New York City
 UNIX rewrite of the MS-DOS program of the same name, which in turn was
 inspired by John E. Dell's "Drug Wars" game. You have one month to buy and
 sell drugs on the streets of New York, the aim being first to pay off your
 debt to the loan shark and then to make a fortune. And if you have to shoot
 a few cops in the process, well... The game includes TCP networking allowing
 you to meet (and shoot) other human drug dealers.
