Description: port scanner for discovering services on large networks
 doscan is a tool to discover TCP services on your network. It is
 designed for scanning a single ports on a large network.  doscan
 contacts many hosts in parallel, using standard TCP sockets provided
 by the operating system.  It is possible to send strings to remote
 hosts, and collect the banners they return.
 .
 There are better tools for scanning many ports on a small set of
 hosts, for example nmap.
