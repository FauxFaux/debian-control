Description: Extra QA tools from the Dose3-library
 This package contains extra tools for analyzing meta-data of software
 packages:
  - ceve, a general metadata parser supporting different input formats
    (Debian, rpm, and others) and different output formats.
  - dose-outdated, a Debian-specific tool for finding packages that are not
    installable with respect to a package repository, and that can only be
    made installable again by fixing the package itself.
  - dose-challenged, a Debian-specific tool for checking which packages
    will certainly become uninstallable when some existing package is upgraded
    to a newer version.
  - dose-deb-coinstall, a Debian-specific tool for checking whether a set of
    packages can be installed all together.
 The tools dose-distcheck and dose-builddebcheck are packaged in their
 own resepective packages.
