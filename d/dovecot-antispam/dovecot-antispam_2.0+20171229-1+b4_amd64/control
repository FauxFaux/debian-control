Description: Dovecot plugins for training spam filters
 dovecot-antispam watches designated spam folders and trains mail as spam or
 not-spam when it moves in or out of those folders respectively.
 .
 dovecot-antispam supports dspam, crm114, and generic training by mailing spam
 and non-spam to training addresses.  For crm114, it supports folders for the
 additional "unsure" classification, and trains when moving from there to spam
 or normal folders.
