Description: secure POP3/IMAP server - mail submission agent
 Dovecot is a mail server whose major goals are security and extreme
 reliability. It tries very hard to handle all error conditions and verify
 that all data is valid, making it nearly impossible to crash. It supports
 mbox/Maildir and its own dbox/mdbox formats, and should also be pretty
 fast, extensible, and portable.
 .
 This package contains the Dovecot Mail Submission Agent which implements a
 basic SMTP submission service with BURL support.
