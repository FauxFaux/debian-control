Description: monitor of downtime, shutdown, and crashes
 Downtimed is a daemon intended to monitor and record the times
 an operating system is non-functional.  It does this by keeping
 a simple database file and by regularly recording time stamps.
 A client executable reads the database to account for the lengths
 of periods when the system was down.
