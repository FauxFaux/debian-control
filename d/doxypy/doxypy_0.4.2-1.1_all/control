Description: Python input filter for Doxygen
 doxypy is an input filter for Doxygen. It reformats Python comments
 to conform to Doxygen documentation blocks. This makes it possible
 to use the Doxygen/Javadoc syntax inside of docstrings when writing
 code documentation and automatically generate API documentation out
 of it instead of being forced to use non-Python documentation blocks
 or to document code redundantly.
