Description: Data Plane Development Kit (librte-net runtime library)
 DPDK is a set of libraries for fast packet processing. Applications run
 in user-space and communicate directly with dedicated network interfaces.
 .
 This package contains the runtime libraries for librte_net.
 .
 The librte_net library is a collection of IP protocol definitions and
 convenience macros. It is based on code from the FreeBSD* IP stack and
 contains protocol numbers (for use in IP headers), IP-related macros,
 IPv4/IPv6 header structures and TCP, UDP and SCTP header structures.
