Description: Interactive language for handling numbers, strings, and matrices
 DPUSER is an interactive language capable of handling numbers (both real and
 complex), strings, and matrices. Its main aim is to do astronomical image
 analysis, for which it provides a comprehensive set of functions, but it can
 also be used for many other applications.
 .
 Note that this package was compiled with the giza library instead of PGPLOT,
 since the latter is non-free software.
