Description: FITS file viewer based on DPUSER
 QFitsView is a FITS file viewer based on DPUSER. In addition to displaying
 two-dimensional images, it also provides means to explore three-dimensional
 data cubes. It integrates the functionality of DPUSER which can be accessed
 directly out of QFitsView.
 .
 Note that this package was compiled with the giza library instead of PGPLOT,
 since the latter is non-free software.
