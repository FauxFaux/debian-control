Description: next generation Debian package upload tool (Python 3 library)
 dput-ng is a Debian package upload tool which provides an easy to use
 interface to Debian (like) package archive hosting facilities. It allows
 anyone who works with Debian packages to upload their work to a remote
 service, including Debian's ftp-master, mentors.debian.net, Launchpad or other
 package hosting facilities for Debian package maintainers.
 .
 This package provides Python library functions providing core functionality to
 dput-ng and tools building on top of that. This library provides upload
 classes, profile parser, sanity checks and helper functions required to build
 a dput service.
 .
 The recommended package python3-paramiko is needed to upload via SSH.
