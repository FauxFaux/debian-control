Description: Manages symlinks into a shared DRBD partition
 Manages symlinks into a DRBD partition which is shared among several
 machines.  A simple configuration file, "/etc/drbdlinks.conf",
 specifies the links.  This can be used to manage links for
 /etc/apache, /var/lib/pgsql, and other system directories that need
 to appear as if they are local to the system when running
 applications after a drbd shared partition has been mounted.
 .
 DRBD is a RAID 1 over TCP/IP solution, please have a look at the
 packages drbd-utils and drbd-module-source for more information.
