Description: digital room correction
 DRC is program used to generate correction filters for acoustic compensation
 of HiFi and audio systems in general, including listening room compensation.
 Program generates just the FIR correction filters, which can be used with
 a real time or offline convolver to provide real time or offline correction.

 although really accurate, measuring tools.
