Description: 3D chess game
 DreamChess features 3D OpenGL graphics and provides various chess board sets,
 ranging from classic wooden to flat.
 .
 A moderately strong chess engine is included: Dreamer. However, should this
 engine be too weak for you, then you can use any other XBoard-compatible chess
 engine, including the popular Crafty and GNU Chess.
 .
 Other features include on-screen move lists using SAN notation, undo
 functionality, and savegames in PGN format.
