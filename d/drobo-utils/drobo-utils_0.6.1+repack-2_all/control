 Data Robotics storage units ("Drobos") are external hard drive enclosures that
 connect to your PC via USB or Firewire and provide RAID-like features.  Drobos
 provide automatic data redundancy, hotswappable drive bays, and the size of
 the RAID can be easily expanded.  Different sized hard drives can be mixed on
 the same Drobo.  See http://drobo.com for more information.
