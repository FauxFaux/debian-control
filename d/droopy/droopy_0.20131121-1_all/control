Description: mini web server to let others upload files to your computer
 Droopy is a mini Web server whose sole purpose is to let others upload files to
 your computer.
 .
 Say you are chatting with friends on MSN Messenger (perhaps with the excellent
 Pidgin). They want to send you amazing photos they took last week-end, so they
 use Messenger file transfer. Unfortunately, the zip file is over 50 MB and it
 is painfully slow. Now relax, droopy comes to rescue.
