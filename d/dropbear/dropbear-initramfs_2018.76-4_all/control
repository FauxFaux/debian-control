Description: lightweight SSH2 server and client - initramfs integration
 dropbear is a SSH 2 server and client designed to be small enough to
 be used in small memory environments, while still being functional and
 secure enough for general use.

 It implements most required features of the SSH 2 protocol, and other
 features such as X11 and authentication agent forwarding.
 .
 This package provides initramfs integration.
