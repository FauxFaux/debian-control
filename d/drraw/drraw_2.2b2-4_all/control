Description: simple web based presentation front-end for RRDtool
 drraw is a simple web based presentation front-end for RRDtool that allows you
 to interactively build graphs of your own design. A graph definition can be
 turned into a template which may be applied to many Round Robin Database files.
 .
 drraw specializes in providing an easy mean of displaying data stored with
 RRDtool and does not care about how the data is collected, making it a great
 complement to other RRDtool front-ends.
