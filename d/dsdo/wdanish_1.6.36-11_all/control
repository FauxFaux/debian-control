Description: The Comprehensive Danish Dictionary (DSDO) - wordlist
 The Comprehensive Danish Dictionary (DSDO) is a free spell-checking
 dictionary for Danish published by Skaane Sjaelland Linux User Group
 (SSLUG).  One thing which makes this dictionary different from most
 other dictionaries is that it basically is the result of a vote among
 the proof-readers.  The editorial group has _not_ proof-read all the
 words in the dictionary, but guides the proof-readers and keeps track
 of the overall status of the dictionary.
 .
 This is a flat list of Danish words and names. This can be used by
 spellcheckers or any other purpose needing a lot of words.
