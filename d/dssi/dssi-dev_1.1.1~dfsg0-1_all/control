Description: Header file for compiling DSSI plugins and hosts
 DSSI is an API for audio plugins, with particular application for software
 synthesis plugins with native user interfaces.
 .
 DSSI is an open specification developed for use in Linux audio applications,
 although it is portable to other platforms. It may be thought of as
 LADSPA-for-instruments, or something comparable to VSTi.
 .
 This package contains the header file required for compiling hosts and
 plugins.
