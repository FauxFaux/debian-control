Description: Example of DSSI host
 DSSI is an API for audio plugins, with particular application for software
 synthesis plugins with native user interfaces.
 .
 DSSI is an open specification developed for use in Linux audio applications,
 although it is portable to other platforms. It may be thought of as
 LADSPA-for-instruments, or something comparable to VSTi.
 .
 This package contains an example DSSI host which is useful for testing new
 plugins. It listens for MIDI events on an ALSA sequencer port, delivers them
 to DSSI synths and outputs the result via JACK.  It does not currently support
 audio input (e.g. for DSSI effects plugins).
