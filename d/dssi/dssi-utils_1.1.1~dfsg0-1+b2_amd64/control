Description: Command-line utilities for sending commands to DSSI plugins
 DSSI is an API for audio plugins, with particular application for software
 synthesis plugins with native user interfaces.
 .
 DSSI is an open specification developed for use in Linux audio applications,
 although it is portable to other platforms. It may be thought of as
 LADSPA-for-instruments, or something comparable to VSTi.
 .
 This package contains the dssi_osc_send and dssi_osc_update utilities which
 can, for instance, be used to send commands to the DSSI trivial synth
 plugin.
