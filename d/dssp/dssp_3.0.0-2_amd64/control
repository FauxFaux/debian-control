Description: protein secondary structure assignment based on 3D structure
 DSSP is an application you use to assign the secondary structure of a protein
 based on its solved three dimensional (3D) structure.
 .
 This version (2) of DSSP is a rewrite that produces the same output as the
 original DSSP, but deals better with exceptions in PDB files and is much
 faster.
