Description: Paperless money transfer with German banks on floppies
 This package contains a library that can read and write German DTAUS
 files.  DTAUS is an acronym for DatenTraegerAUStausch.  It is used by
 German credit institutes in order to transfer commands for money
 exchanges between accounts.  This format is used both between banks
 and between banks and their customers.  One mainly wants to use it to
 be able to do automatic "Bankeinzuege".
 .
 This package probably will only be useful in Germany.
