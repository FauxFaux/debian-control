Description: NAT-aware multipath tracerouting tool (dev)
 Dublin Traceroute uses the techniques invented by the authors of
 Paris-traceroute to enumerate the paths of ECMP flow-based load balancing,
 but also introduces a new technique for NAT detection. It forges the IP ID
 in the probe packet and analyzes the responses in order to detect all the
 encountered NATs.
 This package contains development files.
