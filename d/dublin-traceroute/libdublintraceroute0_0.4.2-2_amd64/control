Description: NAT-aware multipath tracerouting tool (library)
 Dublin Traceroute uses the techniques invented by the authors of
 Paris-traceroute to enumerate the paths of ECMP flow-based load balancing,
 but also introduces a new technique for NAT detection. It forges the IP ID
 in the probe packet and analyzes the responses in order to detect all the
 encountered NATs.
 This package contains a dynamic library.
