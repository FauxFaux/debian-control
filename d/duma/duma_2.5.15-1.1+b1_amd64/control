Description: library to detect buffer overruns and under-runs in C and C++ programs
 Open-source library to detect buffer overruns and under-runs
 in C and C++ programs.
 .
 This library is a fork of Bruce Perens Electric Fence library and adds
 some new features to it. Features of the DUMA library:
   * "overloads" all standard memory allocation functions like
     malloc(), calloc(), memalign(), strdup(), operator new, operator
     new[] and also their counterpart deallocation functions like free(),
     operator delete and operator delete[]
   * utilizes the MMU (memory management unit) of the CPU:
     allocates and protects an extra memory page to detect any illegal
     access beyond the top of the buffer (or bottom, at the user's option)
   * stops the program at exactly that instruction, which does the
     erroneous access to the protected memory page,
     allowing location of the defective source code in a debugger
     detects erroneous writes at the non-protected end of the memory
     block at deallocation of the memory block
   * detects mismatch of allocation/deallocation functions: f.e.
     allocation with malloc() but deallocation with operator delete
   * leak detection: detect memory blocks which were not deallocated
     until program exit
   * preloading of the library
   * allowing tests without necessity of changing source code or recompilation
