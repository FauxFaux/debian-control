Description: Register a GSF ID for mock-up Android devices
 Dummy Droid allows you to create hardware profiles for arbitrary
 Android devices and upload them into your Google Play account,
 thereby creating a "Google Services Framework ID".
 .
 Mocks can either be generated from the /system/build.prop file of
 existing hardware or be completely made up from scratch. You (may)
 need this tool if Google Play won't give you access to an app because
 of device incompatibilities, country or carrier restrictions. You
 (may) also need this tool if you are an app developer yourself and
 want to test compatibility filter settings without actually owning
 the target device.
 .
 Word of warning: Dummy Droid grants you absolute freedom, including
 the freedom to specify absolute nonsense (such as a smart-tv with a
 screensize of 1 pixel). Please pay attention to the instructions and
 use a throw-away account for testing. Otherwise you might end up with
 dozens of mocks in your main account you cannot get rid of again!
