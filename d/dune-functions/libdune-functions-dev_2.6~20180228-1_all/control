Description: toolbox for solving PDEs -- interface for functions (development files)
 DUNE, the Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment is a modular toolbox
 for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with grid-based methods.
 It supports the easy implementation of methods like Finite Elements (FE),
 Finite Volumes (FV), and also Finite Differences (FD).
 .
 dune-functions provides an interface for global finite element functions.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
