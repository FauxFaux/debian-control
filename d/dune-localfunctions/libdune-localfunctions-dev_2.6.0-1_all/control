Description: toolbox for solving PDEs -- local basis (development files)
 DUNE, the Distributed and Unified Numerics Environment is a modular toolbox
 for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with grid-based methods.
 It supports the easy implementation of methods like Finite Elements (FE),
 Finite Volumes (FV), and also Finite Differences (FD).
 .
 This package contains the development files for the interface for the local
 basis and layout of the degrees of freedom.
