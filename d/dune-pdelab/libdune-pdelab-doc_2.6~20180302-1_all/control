Description: toolbox for solving PDEs -- discretization module (documentation)
 DUNE-PDELab is a new generalized discretization module for a wide range of
 discretization methods. It allows rapid prototyping for implementing
 discretizations and solvers for systems of PDEs based on DUNE.
 .
 This package contains the documentation.
