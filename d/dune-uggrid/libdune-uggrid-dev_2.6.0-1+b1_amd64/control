Description: software framework for finite element methods (development files)
 UG is a flexible software tool for the numerical solution of partial
 differential equations on unstructured meshes, with a focus on
 multigrid methods. It has a very powerful grid manager, which supports
 two- and three-dimensional grids with mixed element types. The grids
 can be adaptively refinement using either classic
 red/green-refinement, or pure red refinement with hanging nodes. All
 this is fully parallelized and can run on large distributed machines.
 .
 The version in this package has been built with the necessary flags for use
 with the Dune software system.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
