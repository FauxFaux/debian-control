Description: backup tool using MiniDV camcorders
 Dvbackup hides the data it receives on standard input in a perfectly
 legal DV (digital video) stream. This allows you to use your DV camcorder
 and your DV cartridges as a potent mass storage system. Obviously, your
 system and your camcorder have to be connected via IEEE1394 (aka Firewire,
 iLink).
 .
 Current digital camcorders can save approximately 13 GB of data on those
 tiny DV cartridges at a speed of 3.6 MB/sec. That's faster than most
 DAT streamers which only work at 1 MB/sec or less. dvbackup can not use all of
 the data, but 10 GB should be good enough for everyone.
 .
 To bring the data on tape, you have to use an additional utility, called
 dvconnect, which is included in libdv-bin.
