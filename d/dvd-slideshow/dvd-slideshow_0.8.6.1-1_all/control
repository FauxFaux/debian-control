Description: set of tools to create DVD slideshows with menus
 DVD Slideshow consists in a set of tools which allows one to create
 slideshows-style videos from a collection of pictures. This package
 provides the following programs:
  * dir2slideshow: Generates a listing of the pictures in a given
    directory for easy input to dvd-slideshow.
  * dvd-slideshow: This is the main script. It generates a DVD-compatible
    MPEG2 video file with audio from a text file input listing of pictures
    and effects.
  * dvd-menu: Creates a simple DVD menu with buttons that link to MPEG2
    files generated with dvd-slideshow or ones created by the user.
  * gallery1-to-slideshow: Generates a text file listing of the pictures
    visible in a given "Gallery" (http://gallery.sourceforge.net) photo
    album in order to easily pass the information to dvd_slideshow.
  * jigl2slideshow: Does the same thing as gallery2slideshow, but works
    on a jigl gallery.
