Description: tool to rip DVD's from the command line
 dvdbackup will extract all (or optionally only selected) titles as found
 on the dvd.  It will structure the extracted files in a format suitable for
 burning at a later time with genisoimage and dvdrecord.  Has the advantage of
 being very easy to use, small, and fast.
