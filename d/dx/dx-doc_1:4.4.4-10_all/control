Description: OpenDX (IBM Visualization Data Explorer) - documentation
 Data Explorer is a system of tools and user interfaces for visualizing data.
 In general terms the visualization of data can be considered a 3-stage
 process:
    1. Describing and importing data
    2. Processing the data through a visualization program
    3. Presenting the resulting image.
 This is the documentation package. It includes online help and html
 documentation.
