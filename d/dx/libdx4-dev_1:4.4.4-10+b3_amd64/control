Description: OpenDX (IBM Visualization Data Explorer) - development files
 Data Explorer is a system of tools and user interfaces for visualizing data.
 In general terms the visualization of data can be considered a 3-stage
 process:
    1. Describing and importing data
    2. Processing the data through a visualization program
    3. Presenting the resulting image.
 This is the development package. It contains the build rules, library
 routines and header files necessary for creating custom software that uses
 the OpenDX classes.
