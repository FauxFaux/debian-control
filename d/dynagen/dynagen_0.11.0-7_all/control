Description: Cisco 7200 Router Emulator Command Line Interface
 Dynagen is a text-based front end for Dynamips, that uses the
 Hypervisor mode for communication with Dynamips. Dynagen simplifies
 building and working with virtual networks:
  * Uses a simple, easy to understand configuration file for specifying
    virtual router hardware configurations
  * Simple syntax for interconnecting routers, bridges, frame-relay and
    ATM switches. No need to deal with NetIOs
  * Can work in a client / server mode, with Dynagen running on your
    workstation communicating to Dynamips running on a back-end server.
    Dynagen can also control multiple Dynamips servers simultaneously for
    distributing large virtual networks across several machines.
  * Provides a management CLI for listing devices, starting, stopping,
    reloading, suspending, and resuming virtual routers.
