Description: JVM Dynamic Languages Metaobject Protocol
 This library aims to make it possible for objects created by a runtime for one
 dynamic language to be passed to and manipulated by a different dynamic
 language, running within the same JVM. More generally, it aims to provide a
 facility where an arbitrary system (usually a language runtime) can intuitively
 manipulate any arbitrary object model built atop of Java objects (usually the
 native object model of some other language).
 .
 Basically, it provides a unified mechanism that all dynamic languages on the
 JVM can use to inter-operably manipulate their own objects as well as objects
 from any other language that also uses this mechanism.
