Description: two-factor HOTP/TOTP authentication - server daemon
 dynalogin is a two-factor authentication framework based on the HOTP/TOTP
 (Open Authentication) algorithms.  Dynalogin can store credentials in
 any database supported by UNIXODBC, which makes the solution
 robust and scalable.  It can also store credentials in flat files
 if desired.  dynalogin has been successfully integrated in solutions
 for OpenID, making it possible to use two-factor authentication with
 hundreds of other web applications and public web sites.  There is a
 dynalogin soft-token for Android and it also works with Google
 Authenticator.
 .
 This package provides dynalogind, the server daemon for a dynalogin
 two-factor authentication server.
