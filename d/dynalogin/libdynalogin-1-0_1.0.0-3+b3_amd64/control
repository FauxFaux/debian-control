Description: two-factor HOTP/TOTP authentication - implementation libs
 dynalogin is a two-factor authentication framework based on HOTP/TOTP
 (Open Authentication) algorithms.  Dynalogin can store credentials in
 any database supported by UNIXODBC, which makes the solution
 robust and scalable.  It can also store credentials in flat files
 if desired.  dynalogin has been successfully integrated in solutions
 for OpenID, making it possible to use two-factor authentication with
 hundreds of other web applications and public web sites.  There is a
 dynalogin soft-token for Android and it also works with Google
 Authenticator.
 .
 This library is used by a dynalogin authentication server or any other
 software component that wants to implement the HOTP/TOTP algorithm
 internally.  The package also includes various storage modules (file
 storage and UNIXODBC) for retaining the user credentials and algorithm
 data.
