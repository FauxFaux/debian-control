Description: two-factor HOTP/TOTP authentication - implementation libs
 dynalogin is a two-factor authentication framework based on the HOTP/TOTP
 (Open Authentication) algorithms.  Dynalogin can store credentials in
 any database supported by UNIXODBC, which makes the solution
 robust and scalable.  It can also store credentials in flat files
 if desired.  dynalogin has been successfully integrated in solutions
 for OpenID, making it possible to use two-factor authentication with
 hundreds of other web applications and public web sites.  There is a
 dynalogin soft-token for Android and it also works with Google
 Authenticator.
 .
 This library is used by any application that wants to authenticate
 users against the dynalogin server.  It is able to make the TLS
 connection to the dynalogin server and communicate requests and
 responses using the dynalogin wire protocol.  It is used by
 pam_dynalogin.
