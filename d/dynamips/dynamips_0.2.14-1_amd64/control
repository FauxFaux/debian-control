Description: Cisco 7200/3600/3725/3745/2600/1700 Router Emulator
 Dynamips emulates Cisco 7200/3600/3725/3745/2600/1700 Routers on a traditional
 PC.  You can use dynamips to create labs. It uses IOS Images (which are not
 part of this package). Of course, this emulator cannot replace a real router.
 .
 It is simply a complementary tool to real labs for administrators of Cisco
 networks or people wanting to pass their CCNA/CCNP/CCIE exams. For a Command
 Line Interface for dynamips see dynagen or gns3 package.
