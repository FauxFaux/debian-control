Description: Handling of HEALPix sky pixellization
 The package creates sky pixelization to a specified resolution.
 .
 These tools permit creation of HEALPix maps as well as use of
 existing maps. There are tools to translate sky coordinates (Ra, Dec)
 to a pixel number, and to generate a list of neighboring pixels
 within some specified radius. More complicated queries are also
 supported.
