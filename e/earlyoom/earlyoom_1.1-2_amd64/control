Description: Early OOM Daemon
 Earlyoom is an userspace OOM-killer which can avoid the system to get into
 unresponsive state caused by swapping, which is most likely to occur when a
 large swap is present and memory is tight. It checks the amount of available
 memory and swap periodically, and when both are below a preconfigured value,
 it kills the largest process.
