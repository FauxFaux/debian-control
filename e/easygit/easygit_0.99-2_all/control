Description: git for mere mortals
 In short, Easy GIT is a single-file wrapper script for git, designed
 to make git easy to learn and use.
 .
 Features:
     * eg focuses on documentation and examples
     * eg removes many principle-of-least-surprise violations that
       catch git newbies unaware
     * eg provides subcommands that are a natural extension of
       capabilities users know from cvs/svn (eg also takes care to
       make sure the modifications to its subcommands are easily
       discoverable and error-avoiding for existing git users as
       well!)
