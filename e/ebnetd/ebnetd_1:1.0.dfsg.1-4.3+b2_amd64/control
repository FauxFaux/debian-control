Description: the server of EBNET protocol
 The EBNETD distribution is a series of servers which provide ways to
 access so-called "CD-ROM books" via TCP/IP, using EB Library.  The CD-ROM
 books is a popular form to provide dictionaries and multimedia references
 in Japan.  Various formats such as EB, EBG, EBXA, EBXA-C, S-EBXA and EPWING
 are supported.
 .
 ebnetd speaks EBNET protocol.  With ebnetd, applications using EB Library
 can access CD-ROM books on a remote server on which ebnetd runs.
