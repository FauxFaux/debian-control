Description: GTK+ chessboard program
 eboard is a graphical chess program which can function as an interface to
 Internet chess servers such as FICS and to chess engines such as Crafty.
 .
 eboard has a themeable and freely resizable board, a tabbed or multi-window
 display, and supports multiple simultaneous boards.
 .
 This package contains a chess interface, which means that you can play against
 another human on the same computer, or play on an Internet server.  If you
 would like to play against a computer, you should install a chess engine such
 as gnuchess in addition.
