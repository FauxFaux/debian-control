Description: multitrack-capable audio recorder and effect processor (emacs)
 Ecasound is a software package designed for multitrack audio processing. It
 can be used for simple tasks like audio playback, recording and format
 conversions, as well as for multitrack effect processing, mixing, recording
 and signal recycling.
 .
 Ecasound supports a wide range of audio inputs, outputs and effect algorithms.
 Effects and audio objects can be combined in various ways, and their parameters
 can be controlled by operator objects like oscillators and MIDI-CCs.
 .
 This package provides an interactive mode for running ecasound sessions from
 within Emacs as well as Emacs Lisp bindings to the Ecasound Control Interface.
