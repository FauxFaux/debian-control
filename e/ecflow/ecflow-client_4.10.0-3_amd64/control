Description: Client tools for Meteorological workflow
 ecFlow is a work flow package that enables users to run
 a large number of programs ( with dependencies on each other
 and on time) in a controlled environment.
 It provides reasonable tolerance for hardware and software failures,
 combined with good restart capabilities.
 .
 ecFlow submits tasks(jobs) and receives acknowledgements from tasks
 when they change status and when they send events, using child commands
 embedded in the scripts. ecflow stores the relationship between tasks,
 and is able to submit tasks dependent on triggers.
 .
 This package contains the client tools
