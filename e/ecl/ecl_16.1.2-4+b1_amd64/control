Description: Embeddable Common-Lisp: has an interpreter and can compile to C
 ECL stands for Embeddable Common-Lisp. The ECL project is an
 effort to modernize Giuseppe Attardi's ECL environment to
 produce an implementation of the Common-Lisp language
 which complies to the ANSI X3J13 definition of the language.
 .
 The current ECL implementation features:
  * A bytecodes compiler and interpreter.
  * A translator to C.
  * A UFFI-compatible interface to C code.
  * A dynamic loader.
  * The possibility to build standalone executables and DLLs.
  * The Common-Lisp Object System (CLOS).
  * Conditions and restarts for handling errors.
  * Sockets as ordinary streams.
  * The GNU Multiprecision library for fast bignum operations.
  * A simple conservative mark & sweep garbage collector.
  * The Boehm-Weiser garbage collector.
