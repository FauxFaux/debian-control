Description: pkg-config support for Eclipse C/C++ development tools
 The aim of the Eclipse plug-in is to provide automation of configuration needed
 for projects using pkg-config, such as GTK+ and gtkmm.
 .
 The plug-in will set options and switches automatically that gcc needs to add
 in the selected packages - specifically the header file paths, the libraries,
 and some other gcc switches.
