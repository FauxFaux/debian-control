Description: Autotools support for Eclipse CDT
 The Autotools suite of plugins adds to the CDT a support for building and
 maintaining C/C++ projects that use Autotools. With this additional support,
 a vast repository of C/C++ code can be checked out, built, and maintained
 under the CDT rather easily without having to resort to the command line.
 .
 In conjunction with the CDT, the plugin can do the following:
  * Build a C/C++ project that uses a configure script or an autogen
    script or a Makefile.cvs script
  * Create a simple C or C++ hello world Autotools project via a template
  * Allow configuration parameters to be set via a gui and to rebuild when
    configuration parameters are changed
  * Colorized editing of configuration files such as configure.in, configure.ac,
    Makefile.am, and Makefile.in with full hover help for autoconf/automake
    macros
  * Allow specification of multiple build configurations for a single project
  * Run autotools such as autoconf, automake, or aclocal directly using a gui
    interface
  * Includes hover help for autoconf and automake macros in the editors
