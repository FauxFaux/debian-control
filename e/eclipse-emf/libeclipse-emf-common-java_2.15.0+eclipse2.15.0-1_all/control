Description: Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) Common
 The Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) allows developers to build tools and
 other applications based on a structured data model. From a model
 specification described in XMI, EMF provides tools and runtime support to
 produce a set of Java classes for the model, along with a set of adapter
 classes that enable viewing and command-based editing of the model, and a
 basic editor.
 .
 This package contains the org.eclipse.emf.common bundle.
