Description: 'perf' analysis tool integration for Eclipse CDT
 'perf' is a performance counters subsystem in Linux. Performance counters are
 CPU hardware registers that count hardware events such as instructions executed
 and cache-misses suffered. These counters aid in profiling applications to
 detect hotspots in the application. 'perf' provides per task, per CPU and
 per-workload counters, sampling on top of these and source code event
 annotation.
 .
 The perf plug-in for Eclipse allows the developer to execute profiles in their
 applications in a seamless way, using quick launch actions and visualizing
 the results in an user-friendly interface.
