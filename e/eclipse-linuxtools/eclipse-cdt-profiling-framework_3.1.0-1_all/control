Description: framework for profiling tools for Eclipse CDT
 This package provides a common infrastructure that allows one to integrate
 various profiling tools into Eclipse IDE. It supports 3 categories of tools:
 .
  * Timing - measure the amount of time taken in functions and methods
  * Memory - profiles heap/stack/cache usage for an application
  * Coverage - measures how much of the code gets exercised in a run
 .
 In addition to this package, a plugin that integrates particular profiling tool
 (e.g. Valgrind or perf) is required in order to run performance analysis.
