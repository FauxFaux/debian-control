Description: Task-Focused Interface for Eclipse
 Mylyn is a Task-Focused Interface for Eclipse that reduces information overload
 and makes multi-tasking easy. It does this by making tasks a first class part
 of Eclipse, and integrating rich and offline editing for repositories such as
 Bugzilla, Trac, and JIRA.
 .
 Once your tasks are integrated, Mylyn monitors your work activity to identify
 information relevant to the task-at-hand, and uses this task context to focus
 the Eclipse UI on the interesting information, hide the uninteresting, and
 automatically find what's related. This puts the information you need to get
 work done at your fingertips and improves productivity by reducing searching,
 scrolling, and navigation. By making task context explicit Mylyn also
 facilitates multitasking, planning, reusing past efforts, and sharing
 expertise.
