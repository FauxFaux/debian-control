Description: Eclipse Core Variables
 The Debug component of the Eclipse platform defines language independent
 facilities and mechanisms for:
  * Launching programs
  * Source lookup
  * Defining and registering breakpoints
  * Event notification from programs being debugged
  * A language independent debug model
  * A language independent debug UI
 .
 The Debug component does not provide an implementation of a debugger, it
 is the duty of other plug-ins to provide language specific implementations
 of debuggers.
 .
 This package contains the org.eclipse.core.variables bundle.
