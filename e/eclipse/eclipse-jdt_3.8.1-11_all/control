Description: Eclipse Java Development Tools (JDT)
 The Eclipse Platform is an open and extensible platform for anything and yet
 nothing in particular. It provides a foundation for constructing and running
 integrated software-development tools. The Eclipse Platform allows tool
 builders to independently develop tools that integrate with other people's
 tools so seamlessly you can't tell where one tool ends and another starts.
 .
 This package contains Java Development Tools. These provide a powerful
 Java IDE along with several editors, a refactoring engine, Ant and JUnit
 integration, a debugger, and many more features.
