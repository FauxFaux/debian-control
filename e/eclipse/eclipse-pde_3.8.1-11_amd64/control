Description: Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment (PDE)
 The Eclipse Platform is an open and extensible platform for anything and yet
 nothing in particular. It provides a foundation for constructing and running
 integrated software-development tools. The Eclipse Platform allows tool
 builders to independently develop tools that integrate with other people's
 tools so seamlessly you can't tell where one tool ends and another starts.
 .
 This package provides tools for easy development of plug-ins for Eclipse.
