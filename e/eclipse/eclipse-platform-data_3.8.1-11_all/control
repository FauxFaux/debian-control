Description: Eclipse platform without development plug-ins (data)
 The Eclipse Platform is an open and extensible platform for anything and yet
 nothing in particular. It provides a foundation for constructing and running
 integrated software-development tools. The Eclipse Platform allows tool
 builders to independently develop tools that integrate with other people's
 tools so seamlessly you can't tell where one tool ends and another starts.
 .
 The Eclipse Platform is the base for all Eclipse development plug-ins, but it
 does not include any. These are available in different packages, for example:
 .
  * eclipse-jdt Java Development Tools
  * eclipse-pde Plug-in Development Tools
  * eclipse-cdt C/C++ Development Tools
 .
 This package contains the architecture-independent data files of the Eclipse
 Platform.
