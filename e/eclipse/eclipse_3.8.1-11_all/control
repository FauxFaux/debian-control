Description: Extensible Tool Platform and Java IDE
 The Eclipse Platform is an open and extensible platform for anything and yet
 nothing in particular. It provides a foundation for constructing and running
 integrated software-development tools. The Eclipse Platform allows tool
 builders to independently develop tools that integrate with other people's
 tools so seamlessly you can't tell where one tool ends and another starts.
 .
 This package provides the whole Eclipse SDK that contains Eclipse Platform,
 Java development tools and Plug-in Development Environment, including source
 and both user and programmer documentation.
