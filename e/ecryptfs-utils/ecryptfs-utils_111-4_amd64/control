Description: ecryptfs cryptographic filesystem (utilities)
 eCryptfs is a POSIX-compliant enterprise-class stacked cryptographic
 filesystem for Linux.
 .
 It provides advanced key management and policy features. eCryptfs stores
 cryptographic metadata in the header of each file written, so that encrypted
 files can be copied between hosts; the file will be decryptable with the
 proper key, and there is no need to keep track of any additional information
 aside from what is already in the encrypted file itself. Think of eCryptfs as
 a sort of "gnupgfs".
 .
 eCryptfs is a native Linux filesystem. The kernel module component of
 eCryptfs is part of the Linux kernel since 2.6.19.
 .
 This package contains the userland utilities.
