Description: /bin/ed-alike webbrowser written in C
 edbrowse is a reimplementation of /bin/ed, with some basic
 differences (it uses Perl regular expressions) with the ability to
 visit webpages and ftp sites. edbrowse performs basic transformations
 on the html source to produce a readable representation. edbrowse
 supports Forms, Frames, Netscape-style cookies, HTTPS
 connections and JavaScript.
