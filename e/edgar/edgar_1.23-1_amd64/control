Description: 2D platform game with a persistent world
 The Legend of Edgar is a platform game, not unlike those found on the Amiga
 and SNES. Edgar must battle his way across the world, solving puzzles and
 defeating powerful enemies to achieve his quest.
 .
 When Edgar's father fails to return home after venturing out one dark and
 stormy night, Edgar fears the worst: he has been captured by the evil
 sorcerer who lives in a fortress beyond the forbidden swamp.
 .
 Donning his armour, Edgar sets off to rescue him, but his quest will not be
 easy...
