Description: Emacs interface to Edict
 This package provides edict.el and associated files, thus allowing
 to query the Edict Japanese-English dictionary from within Emacs.
 .
 Using the region and couple of keystrokes, edict.el will look up the
 Japanese key and return all the Edict entries containing that key, in
 a pop-up buffer.  English is even easier, you just put point anywhere
 in the word you want to look up.
