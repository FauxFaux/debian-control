Description: line editing library similar to readline
 This is a line-editing library. It can be linked into almost any program
 to provide command-line editing and recall. It is call-compatible with a
 subset of the FSF readline library, but it is a fraction of the size (and
 offers fewer features).
 .
 This package contains the runtime library only.
