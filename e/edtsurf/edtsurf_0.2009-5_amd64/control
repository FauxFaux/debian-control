Description: triangulated mesh surfaces for protein structures
 EDTSurf is a open source program to construct triangulated surfaces
 for macromolecules. It generates three major macromolecular surfaces:
 van der Waals surface, solvent-accessible surface and molecular surface
 (solvent-excluded surface). EDTsurf also identifies cavities which are
 inside of macromolecules.
