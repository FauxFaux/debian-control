Description: Biosignal acquisition device library (free plugins)
 eegdev is a library that provides a unified interface for accessing various
 EEG (and other biosignals) acquisition systems. This interface has been
 designed to be both flexible and efficient. The device specific part is
 implemented by the mean of plugins which makes adding new device backend
 fairly easy even if the library does not support them yet officially.
 .
 The core library not only provides to users a unified and consistent
 interfaces to the acquisition device but it also provides many
 functionalities to the device backends (plugins) ranging from configuration
 to data casting and scaling making writing new device backend an easy task.
 .
 This library is particularly useful to handle the acquisition part of a
 Brain Computer Interface (BCI) or any realtime multi-electrode acquisition
 in neurophysiological research.
 .
 This package contains the devices plugins that depends only on free
 components.
