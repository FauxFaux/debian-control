Description: Core abstraction layer for enlightenment DR 0.17
 This is the core event abstraction layer and X abstraction layer that makes
 doing selections, Xdnd, general X stuff, and event loops, timeouts and idle
 handlers fast, optimized, and convenient. It's a separate library so anyone
 can make use of the work put into Ecore to make this job easy for
 applications.
