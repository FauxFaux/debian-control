Description: Library that provides vector graphics capabilities for EFL
 Ector provides a new retained rendering library that is used by Evas
 to provide Evas_Object_VG. This is a new Evas_Object that provides a
 vector graphics scene graph following the SVG specification. It will
 be considered a bug if some behaviour does not follow the SVG
 standard. Evas_Object_VG provides 3 kind of objects for now: shape,
 as well as linear and radial gradients.
 .
 This package provides the libector1 library.
