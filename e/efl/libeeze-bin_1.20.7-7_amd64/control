Description: Library for manipulating devices through udev binary utilities
 This library is part of the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL). It
 interfaces directly with libudev, avoiding such middleman daemons as
 udisks/upower or hal, and gathers device information when it becomes
 known to the system. This can be used to determine such things as:
  - If a cdrom has a disk inserted
  - The temperature of a cpu core
  - The remaining power left in a battery
  - The current power consumption of various parts
  - Monitor in realtime the status of peripheral devices
 .
 This package contains command-line utilities that allow mounting,
 scanning, and unmounting devices with eeze.
