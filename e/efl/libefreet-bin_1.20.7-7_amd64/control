Description: D-Bus activated helper binary to create efreet data caches
 An implementation of several specifications from freedesktop.org intended for
 use in Enlightenment DR17 (e17) and other applications using the Enlightenment
 Foundation Libraries (EFL). Currently, the following specifications are
 included:
  - Base Directory
  - Desktop Entry
  - Icon Theme
  - Menu
 .
 This package provides the efreetd helper binary and the associated D-Bus
 service file that are internally used by libefreet.
