Description: Library providing non-blocking I/O using threads
 This library is part of the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL). It is
 intended to provide non-blocking IO by using thread for all operations that
 may block. It should integrate all the features/functions of Ecore_File that
 could block.
