Description: Library providing geo information management in EFL
 Elocation is meant as a convenience library to ease application
 developers the usage of geo information in their apps. Adding a geo
 tag to a picture or translating an address to a GPS position and show
 it on a map widget are just some of the use cases.In the beginning
 elocation will rely on the GeoClue1 DBus service. Supporting the new
 GeoClue2 DBus service is planned and worked on.
