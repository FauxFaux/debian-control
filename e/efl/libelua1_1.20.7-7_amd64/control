Description: Lua wrapper and convenience layer for EFL shared objects
 Elua is a new LuaJIT based runtime (name is temporary) for rapid
 application development with the EFL. It counts on Eolian to provide
 bindings. It's meant to be a high performance/low footprint runtime,
 competitive with C applications as far as performance is
 concerned. Currently in very early stage of development.
