Description: SMALL compiler creating Embryo bytecode
 Embryo is primarily a shared library that gives you an API to load
 and control interpreted programs compiled into an abstract machine
 bytecode that it understands.  This abstract (or virtual) machine is
 similar to a real machine with a CPU, but it is emulated in
 software
 .
 This package contains the embryo compiler: embryo_cc.
