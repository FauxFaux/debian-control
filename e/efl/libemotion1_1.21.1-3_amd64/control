Description: Media object creation/manipulation library
 Emotion is a library that allows playing audio and video files, using one of
 its backends (GStreamer, xine or generic shm player).
 .
 It is integrated into Ecore through its mainloop, and is transparent to the
 user of the library how the decoding of audio and video is being done. Once
 the objects are created, the user can set callbacks to the specific events and
 set options to this object, all in the main loop.
