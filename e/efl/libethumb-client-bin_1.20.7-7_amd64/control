Description: D-Bus activated helper binary to create thumbnails with libethumb
 Ethumb-Client creates thumbnails by communicating with a thumbnail generation
 server using standard D-Bus protocol. The server uses Ethumb itself to
 generate the thumbnail images and cache them using FreeDesktop.Org standard.
 .
 This package provides the ethumbd helper binary and the associated D-Bus
 service file that are internally used by libethumb-client.
