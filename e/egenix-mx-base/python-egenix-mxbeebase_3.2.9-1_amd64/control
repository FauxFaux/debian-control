Description: on-disk B+Tree based database kit for Python
 mxBeeBase is a high performance construction kit for disk based
 indexed databases. It offers components which you can plug together
 to easily build your own custom mid-sized databases.
 .
 The two basic building blocks in mxBeeBase are storage and
 index. Storage is implemented as variable record length data storage
 with integrated data protection features, automatic data recovery and
 locking for multi process access. Indexes use a high performance
 optimized B+Tree implementation built on top of Thomas Niemann's
 Cookbook B+Tree implementation.
 .
 mxBeeBase comes with two readily usable on-disk dictionary
 implementations: BeeDict and BeeStringDict.
