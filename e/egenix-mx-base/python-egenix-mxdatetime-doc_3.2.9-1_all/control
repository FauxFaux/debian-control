Description: date and time handling routines for Python (documentation)
 mxDateTime is a Python extension package that provides three new
 objects, DateTime, DateTimeDelta and RelativeDateTime, which let you
 store and handle date/time values in a much more natural way than by
 using ticks (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), the representation
 used by Python's time module).
 .
 The package includes documentation for mxDateTime.
