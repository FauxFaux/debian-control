Description: flexible URL datatype for Python
 mxURL provides a new easy to use, fast and light-weight builtin
 datatype URL for storing and manipulating Universal Resource Locators
 (URLs), as well as a few helpers related to URL building, encoding
 and decoding.
 .
 The new type supports the common tasks of URL joining and gives direct
 access to the various URL components. It also provides methods for
 rebuilding URLs, e.g. replacing the host or just the scheme in an
 existing URL.
 .
 All this is coded in C to give you the fastest possible performance
 for these everyday web application operations.
