Description: Architecture independent files for eggdrop
 This package contains all the files that eggdrop places on /usr/share.
 These files are not specific to a single processor architecture once
 the package is built, so a single package can serve all the archs
 Debian supports.
 .
 This package is not useful at all if eggdrop is not installed.
