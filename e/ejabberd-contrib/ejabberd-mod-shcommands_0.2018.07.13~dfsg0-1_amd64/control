Description: execute shell commands via XMPP (dangerous!)
 WARNING: USE THIS MODULE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!
 This module allows ejabberd administrators to remotely execute shell commands
 which could compromise both the ejabberd server and the whole machine.
 .
 This module provides the ejabberd server administrator a method to remotely
 execute shell commands through the ejabberd server.
 .
 It provides a page in the ejabberd Web Admin which only the administrators of
 the whole server can access.
 .
 Three types of commands are possible:
  * ejabberd_ctl: makes a call to ejabberd_ctl;
  * erlang shell: executes an erlang command;
  * system shell: executes a command on the system shell.
 The result of the execution will be shown.
 .
 In the system shell, only non-interactive commands will work correctly,
 for example this will work:
  ps -all
 Don't use commands that start an interactive mode:
 DON'T TRY THIS: top
 DON'T TRY THIS: vim readme.txt
 .
 This module does not check if the commands are dangerous or problematic,
 so this module is only recommended for experienced ejabberd and Erlang/OTP
 administrators. USE THIS MODULE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!
