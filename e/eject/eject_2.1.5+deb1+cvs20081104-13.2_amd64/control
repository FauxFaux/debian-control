Description: ejects CDs and operates CD-Changers under Linux
 This little program will eject CD-ROMs (assuming your drive supports
 the CDROMEJECT ioctl). It also allows setting the autoeject feature.

 On supported ATAPI/IDE multi-disc CD-ROM changers, it allows changing
 the active disc.

 You can also use eject to properly disconnect external mass-storage
 devices like digital cameras or portable music players.
