Description: Simtec Electronics UDEKEY01 Entropy Key Daemon
 This is a driver for the Simtec Electronics Entropy Key.  It is
 only needed if you have such a device (or devices).  It provides
 a daemon and tools to drive and control it, as well as options
 for injecting entropy directly into the kernel's pool, or serving
 it via the EGD protocol.
