Description: two-player board game with randomness
 El-Ixir is a board game that has apparently been invented by Isoft in 1981,
 released as a booter floppy.  This is a quite faithful remake, like the
 original using text-mode graphics.
 .
 Every turn, players are presented with four random squares they can place
 a block on.  The object of the game is to connect as many blocks to the
 board's corners as you can, possibly “embracing” areas while doing so.
