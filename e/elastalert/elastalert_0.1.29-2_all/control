Description: easy and flexible alerting with Elasticsearch
 This package contains a simple framework for alerting on anomalies, spikes, or
 other patterns of interest from data in Elasticsearch.
 .
 ElastAlert works with all versions of Elasticsearch.
 .
 If you have data being written into Elasticsearch in near real time and want to
 be alerted when that data matches certain patterns, ElastAlert is the tool for
 you.
 .
 ElastAlert is designed to be reliable, highly modular, and easy to set up and
 configure.
 .
 It works by combining Elasticsearch with two types of components, rule types
 and alerts.  Elasticsearch is periodically queried and the data is passed to
 the rule type, which determines when a match is found. When a match occurs, it
 is given to one or more alerts, which take action based on the match.
 .
 This is configured by a set of rules, each of which defines a query, a rule
 type, and a set of alerts.  .
