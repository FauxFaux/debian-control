Description: elektra configuration store, Lua bindings
 Elektra provides a universal and secure framework to store configuration
 parameters in a hierarchical key-value pair mechanism, instead of each
 program using its own text configuration files. This allows any program
 to read and save its configuration with a consistent API, and allows
 them to be aware of other applications' configurations, permitting
 easy application integration. While architecturally similar to other OS
 registries, Elektra does not have most of the problems found in those
 implementations.
 .
 This package contains the Lua bindings.
