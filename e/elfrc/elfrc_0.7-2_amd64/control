Description: convert arbitrary files into elf objects
 elfrc is a program which can turn arbitrary files into ELF
 object files which can then be linked into your program
 directly and accessed via simple, user-defined symbol names.
 .
 For instance, it's possible to embed even huge (16MB+) files
 directly into the executable and then access the data in constant
 time without making the compiler or linker eat loads of memory.
