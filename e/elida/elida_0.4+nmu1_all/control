Description: pbuilder mail interface
 elida accepts the URL of a .dsc file from the subject of a email
 message and downloads the rest of the files of the corresponding
 Debian source package. If there is a previous version in Debian,
 a diff between the old and new source packages is reported. It
 then runs pbuilder, piuparts, and lintian. The reports are
 compressed and emailed back to the user.
