Description: bind personal keymaps in multiple locations
 `bind-map' is an Emacs package providing the macro bind-map which can
 be used to make a keymap available across different "leader keys"
 including ones tied to evil states. It is essentially a
 generalization of the idea of a leader key as used in vim or the
 Emacs `evil-leader' package, and allows for an arbitrary number of
 "leader keys". This is probably best explained with an example.
