Description: convert buffer text and decorations to HTML
 This package converts the buffer text and the associated decorations
 to HTML. It supports three types of HTML output, selected by setting
 htmlize-output-type: css, inline-css (optimized for code snippets),
 and font (simpler output, doesn't rely on CSS). You can also use
 htmlize from your Emacs Lisp code.
