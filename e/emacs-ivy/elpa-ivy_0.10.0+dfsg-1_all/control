Description: generic completion mechanism for Emacs
 Ivy is an acronym for Incremental Vertical completYon.  While it
 operates similarly to other completion schemes such as
 icomplete-mode, Ivy aims to be more efficient, smaller, simpler, and
 smoother to use--yet highly customizable.
 .
 To try Ivy, just call M-x ivy-mode. This will enable generic Ivy
 completion, including specific completion for file and buffer names.
