Description: alternative to Emacs' isearch with an overview
 Swiper gives an overview of the current regex search candidates.
 The search regex can be split into groups with a space.  Each group
 is highlighted with a different face.
 .
 It can double as a quick regex-builder; however, only single
 lines will be matched.  Swiper uses Ivy to show an overview of all
 matches.
