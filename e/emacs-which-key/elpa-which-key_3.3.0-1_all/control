Description: display available keybindings in popup
 `which-key' is a minor mode for Emacs that displays the key bindings
 following your currently entered incomplete command (a prefix) in a
 popup. For example, after enabling the minor mode if you enter C-x
 and wait for the default of 1 second the minibuffer will expand with
 all of the available key bindings that follow C-x (or as many as
 space allows given your settings). This includes prefixes like C-x 8
 which are shown in a different face.
