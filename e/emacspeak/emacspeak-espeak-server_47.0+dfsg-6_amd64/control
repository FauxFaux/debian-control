Description: espeak synthesis server for emacspeak
 Emacspeak is a speech output system that will allow someone who
 cannot see to work directly on a UNIX system.
 .
 Emacspeak is built on top of Emacs. Once Emacs is started with Emacspeak
 loaded, users get spoken feedback for all actions. As Emacs can do
 everything, they get speech feedback for everything they do.
 .
 This package includes the speech server for the espeak (software)
 speech synthesizer.
