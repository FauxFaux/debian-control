Description: speech output interface to Emacs
 Emacspeak is a speech output system that will allow someone who
 cannot see to work directly on a UNIX system.
 .
 Emacspeak is built on top of Emacs. Once Emacs is started with Emacspeak
 loaded, users get spoken feedback for all actions. As Emacs can do
 everything, they get speech feedback for everything they do.
 .
 This package recommends the speech server for the espeak (software)
 speech synthesizer, so it should work straight away. However it also
 contains the source for speech servers to support the DECtalk Express
 and DECtalk MultiVoice (hardware) speech synthesizers. For other
 synthesizers, look for speech server packages such as emacspeak-ss and
 eflite.
