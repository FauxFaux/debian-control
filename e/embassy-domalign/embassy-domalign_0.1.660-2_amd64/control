Description: Extra EMBOSS commands for protein domain alignment
 The DOMALIGN programs were developed by Jon Ison and colleagues at MRC HGMP
 for their protein domain research. They are included as an EMBASSY package as
 a work in progress.
 .
 Applications in the current domalign release are allversusall (sequence
 similarity data from all-versus-all comparison), domainalign (generates
 alignments (DAF file) for nodes in a DCF file), domainrep (reorders DCF file
 to identify representative structures) and seqalign (extend alignments (DAF
 file) with sequences (DHF file)).
