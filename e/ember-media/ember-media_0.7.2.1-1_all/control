Description: 3D client framework for the WorldForge project -- media files
 Ember is a 3D client framework for WorldForge. It's not meant to be a
 standalone game, instead its purpose is to provide a solid and extensible
 base from which to build game-specific clients. One of the goals of Ember
 is to allow for easy customization of the codebase. Currently it supports
 the game world of Mason.
 .
 This package contains the media used at runtime by Ember.
