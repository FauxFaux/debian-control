Description: EMBOSS Libraries
 This package contains the core libraries of the European Molecular Biology
 Open Software Suite, EMBOSS.
 .
 AJAX covers standard data structures, including strings, sequences, file
 handles, queues, hashes, heaps, lists, dictionaries, trees and dynamic
 arrays. It also covers standard algorithms including comparisons, pattern
 matching, sorting, and iterators. AJAX will also provide a set of high level
 graphics functions suited to the needs of sequence analysis applications.
 .
 The NUCLEUS library provides higher-level functions specific to molecular
 sequence analysis, including sequence comparisons, translation, codon usage
 and annotation.
 .
 It also contains a eplplot, an EMBOSS, a fork of the plplot library.
 .
 In Debian, these libraries are to be considered private.
