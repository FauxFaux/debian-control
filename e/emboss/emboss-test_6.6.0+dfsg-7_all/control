Description: test files for the EMBOSS package
 EMBOSS is a free Open Source software analysis package specially developed for
 the needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user community. The software
 automatically copes with data in a variety of formats and even allows
 transparent retrieval of sequence data from the web. Also, as extensive
 libraries are provided with the package, it is a platform to allow other
 scientists to develop and release software in true open source spirit. EMBOSS
 also integrates a range of currently available packages and tools for sequence
 analysis into a seamless whole. EMBOSS breaks the historical trend towards
 commercial software packages.
 .
 This package includes test files for EMBOSS, the European Molecular Biology
 Open Software Suite.

 It is a good idea to use the data from this package for your bug reports when
 possible.
