Description: war game of the century
 Empire is a console game simulation of a full-scale war between two
 emperors, the computer and you. Naturally, there is only room for
 one, so the object of the game is to destroy the other.
 .
 The world on which the game takes place is a square rectangle containing
 cities, land and water. Cities are used to build armies, planes, and
 ships which can move across the world destroying enemy pieces, exploring,
 and capturing more cities.
 .
 The classic game from the 1980s uses text mode graphical output, drawing
 your units, cities and the world in color. Commands are issued using
 the keyboard.
