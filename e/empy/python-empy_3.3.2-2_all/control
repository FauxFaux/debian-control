Description: templating system for Python (Python 2)
 EmPy is a system for embedding Python expressions and statements
 in template text; it takes an EmPy source file, processes it, and
 produces output.
 This is accomplished via expansions, which are special signals
 to the EmPy system and are set off by a special prefix (by default
 the at sign, '@').  EmPy can expand arbitrary Python expressions
 and statements in this way, as well as a variety of special forms.
 Textual data not explicitly delimited in this way is sent unaffected
 to the output, allowing Python to be used in effect as a markup
 language.
 Also supported are "hook" callbacks, recording and playback via
 diversions, and dynamic, chainable filters.
 The system is highly configurable via command line options and
 embedded commands.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package. This version installs
 the empy executable under the name "empy"
