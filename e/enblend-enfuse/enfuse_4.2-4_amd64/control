Description: image exposure blending tool
 Enfuse blends differently exposed images of the same scene into a nice output
 image, without producing intermediate HDR images that are then tonemapped to a
 viewable image. This simplified process often works much better and quicker
 than the currently known tonemapping algorithms.
 .
 The exposure blending is done using the Mertens-Kautz-Van Reeth exposure
 fusion algorithm. The basic idea is that pixels in the input images are
 weighted according to qualities such as proper exposure, good contrast, and
 high saturation. These weights determine how much a given pixel will
 contribute to the final image.
 .
 Enfuse does not align images for you. Use a tool like Hugin or PanoTools to do
 this. The TIFFs produced by these programs are exactly what Enfuse is designed
 to work with.
