Description: Wrapper library for various spell checker engines (runtime libs)
 Enchant is a generic spell checking library which uses existing
 spell checker engines such as ispell, aspell and myspell as its backends.
 .
 Enchant steps in to provide uniformity and conformity on top of these
 libraries, and implement certain features that may be lacking in any
 individual provider library.
 .
 This package contains the shared library and non-Voikko enchant plugins.
