Description: thin network communication layer on top of UDP - headers

 communication layer on top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol). The primary
 feature it provides is optional reliable, in-order delivery of packets.
 .
 ENet is NOT intended to be a general purpose high level networking library
 that handles authentication, lobbying, server discovery, compression,
 encryption and other high level, often application level or dependent tasks.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
