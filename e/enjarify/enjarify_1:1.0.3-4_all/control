Description: translate Dalvik bytecode to equivalent Java bytecode
 Android applications are Java programs that run on a customized virtual
 machine, which is part of the Android operating system, the Dalvik VM.
 Their bytecode differs from the bytecode of normal Java applications.
 .
 Enjarify can translate the Dalvik bytecode back to equivalent Java bytecode,
 which simplifies the analysis of Android applications.
