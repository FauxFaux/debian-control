Description: Enki is a fast 2D physics-based robot simulator written in C++.
 Enki is able to simulate kinematics, collisions, sensors and cameras of robots
 evolving on a flat surface. It also provides limited support for friction.
 It is able to simulate groups of robots hundred times faster than realtime
 on a modern desktop computer.
