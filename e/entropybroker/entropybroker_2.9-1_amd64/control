Description: infrastructure for distributing random numbers (entropy data)
 Entropy Broker is an infrastructure for distributing cryptographically secure
 random numbers (entropy data) from one or more servers to one or more clients.
 .
 It allows you to distribute entropy data (random values) to /dev/random
 devices from other systems (real servers or virtualised systems).
 It helps preventing that the /dev/random device gets depleted; an empty
 /dev/random-device can cause programs to hang (waiting for entropy data to
 become available).
 .
 This is useful for systems that need to generate encryption keys, run VPN
 software or run a casino website. Also virtual systems that have no good
 sources of entropy like virtual servers (e.g. VMware, XEN and KVM (although
 KVM has the virtio_rnd driver)).
 .
 Entropy Broker is an infrastructure consisting of client-daemons that fill
 /dev/random and server-daemons that feed the central entropy broker-server.
 The server-daemons can gather random values by measuring timer frequency
 noise, analysing noise from a unused audio-device, noise from a video source
 (webcam, tv-card) and random values from a real hardware RNG (random number
 generator).
