Description: store for environment variables across shell processes
 envstore allows you to save environment variables into a separate store, list
 them, and reload them into the (other) shell again. It therefore provides a
 way to share them in cases where exporting to child processes is not feasible.
 .
 Included is envify, a shell script which loads the environment saved with
 envstore and then executes the command given to it.
 .
 A classic use case is MPD_HOST for clients of the Music Player Daemon.
 Commands to control the MPD would be wrapped with envify. If the MPD_HOST were
 then changed in envstore, it would automatically be used.
