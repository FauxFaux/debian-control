Description: Embedded Perl 5 Language
 ePerl interprets an ASCII file bristled with Perl 5 program statements by
 evaluating the Perl 5 code while passing through the plain ASCII data. It
 can operate in various ways: As a stand-alone Unix filter or integrated
 Perl 5 module for general file generation tasks and as a powerful Webserver
 scripting language for dynamic HTML page programming.
