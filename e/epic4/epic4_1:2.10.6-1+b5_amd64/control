Description: epic irc client, version 4
 epic4 is an irc client based on ircII.  It is primarily suited to users who
 wish to write their own irc scripts or have irc scripts written by others.
 .
 Previous versions of epic were 100% compatible with ircII 2.8.2, though
 this is no longer the case.  Instead we've taken a new direction and chosen
 to find places where compatibility with ircII is undesirable and fix them.
 No gratuitous incompatibilities have been added, though many new features
 have been.
