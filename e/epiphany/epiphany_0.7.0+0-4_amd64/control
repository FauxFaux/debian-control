Description: clone of Boulder Dash game
 Epiphany is a multi-platform clone of Boulder Dash.
 In this game, the player must collect all the valuable minerals
 scattered in each level, while avoiding being hit by a falling
 boulder or, worse, by a bomb.
 .
 Boulder Dash was one of the best games ever made for the
 Commodore 64.
