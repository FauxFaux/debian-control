Description: Cross-platform package builder by Easy Software Products
 This package allows a developer to produce packages for several
 different platforms from a single specification.  Currently, Debian
 dpkg, RPM, AT&T/Solaris pkg, HP-UX depot/swinstall, and IRIX
 inst/tardist packages are supported, as well as a "portable" package
 that includes installation and removal scripts and a GUI setup
 program.
