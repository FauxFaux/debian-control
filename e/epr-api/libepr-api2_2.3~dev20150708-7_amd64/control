Description: ENVISAT Product Reader API for C
 The ENVISAT Product Reader API is a set of C-source code files
 supporting developers who want to use MERIS, AATSR, and ASAR data
 products of the ESA ENVISAT satellite in their software.
 .
 The main use case for the C API is the ingestion of ENVISAT data into
   * new scientific algorithms developed for the MERIS, AATSR or ASAR
     sensors or even all of them,
   * existing scientific software packages written in C or C++, or COTS
     software systems which allow for extension using a C or C++
     interface.
