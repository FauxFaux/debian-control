Description: assign files to Emacs projects, programmatically
 Eproject is a minor-mode that allows the grouping of related files
 as projects.  It aims to be as unobtrusive as possible -- no new
 files are created (or required to exist) on disk, and buffers that
 are not a member of a project are not affected in any way.  Where
 'auto-mode-alist activates MODE for FILE-REGEX, Eproject
 activates PROJECT-TYPE for FILES-IN-DIRECTORY, when
 PROJECT-TYPE-DEFINITION is true.  It also creates a customisable
 hook that is run whenever a file belonging to a project is visited.
