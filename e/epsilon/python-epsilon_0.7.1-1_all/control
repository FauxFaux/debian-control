Description: Python utility modules commonly used by Divmod.org project
 Epsilon is a set of Python utility modules, commonly used by all
 Divmod.org Python projects.
 .
 This is intended mainly as a support package for code used by Divmod
 projects, however it contains many generally useful modules.
 .
 Currently included:
  * a powerful date/time formatting and import/export class
    (extime.Time), for exchanging date and time information between all
    Python's various ways to interpret objects as times or time deltas
  * tools for managing concurrent asynchronous processes within Twisted
  * a metaclass which helps you define classes with explicit states
  * a formal system for application of monkey-patches
