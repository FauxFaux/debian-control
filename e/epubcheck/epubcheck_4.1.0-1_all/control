Description: Validation Tool for EPUB
 EpubCheck is a tool to validate IDPF EPUB files. It can detect many types
 of errors in EPUB. OCF container structure, OPF and OPS mark-up, and internal
 reference consistency are checked. EpubCheck can be run as a standalone
 command-line tool, installed as a Java server-side web application or used
 as a Java library.
