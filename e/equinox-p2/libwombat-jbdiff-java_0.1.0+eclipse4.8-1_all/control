Description: Java Binary Diff
 The JBDiff (Java Binary Diff) utility is a Java translation of the bsdiff
 utility for building and applying patches to binary files.
 .
 The file format is similar to, but currently not compatible with the bsdiff
 utility. This is because bsdiff uses bzip2 for compression which is not
 available in the standard Java libraries. Instead gzip compression is used.
