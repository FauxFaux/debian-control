Description: Log-Structured Hash Table for Fast Key/Value Data
 Bitcask is an Erlang application that provides an API for storing and
 retrieving key/value data into a log-structured hash table that provides very
 fast access. The design owes a lot to the principles found in log-structured
 file systems and draws inspiration from a number of designs that involve log
 file merging.
