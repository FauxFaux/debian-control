Description: Examples for erlang-cowboy
 Cowboy is also a socket acceptor pool, able to accept connections
 for any kind of TCP protocol.
 .
 Cowboy aims to provide the following advantages:
 .
   * 'Small' code base.
   * Damn 'fast'.
   * 'Modular': transport and protocol handlers are replaceable.
   * 'Binary HTTP' for greater speed and lower memory usage.
   * Easy to 'embed' inside another application.
   * Selectively 'dispatch' requests to handlers, allowing you to send some
     requests to your embedded code and others to a FastCGI application in
     PHP or Ruby.
   * No parameterized module. No process dictionary. 'Clean' Erlang code.
 .
 This package includes erlang-cowboy examples.
