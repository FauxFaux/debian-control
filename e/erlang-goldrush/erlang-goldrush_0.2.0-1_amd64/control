Description: small Erlang app that provides fast event stream processing
 Goldrush is a small Erlang app that provides fast event stream processing
 .
 Features:
  * Event processing compiled to a query module
   - per module protected event processing statistics
   - query module logic can be combined for any/all filters
   - query module logic can be reduced to efficiently match event processing
  * Complex event processing logic
   - match input events with greater than (gt) logic
   - match input events with less than (lt) logic
   - match input events with equal to (eq) logic
   - match input events with wildcard (wc) logic
   - match input events with notfound (nf) logic
   - match no input events (null blackhole) logic
   - match all input events (null passthrough) logic
  * Handle output events
   - Once a query has been composed the output action can be overridden
     with an erlang function. The function will be applied to each
     output event from the query.
