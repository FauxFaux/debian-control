Description: Erlang library for integrated performance testing
 Horse is designed to provide quick feedback on the performance
 of units of code, for example a function or a group of functions.
 .
 Horse works in a manner similar to the `eunit` application: it
 will export automatically all the performance test functions,
 run them one after another and give you a convenient report.
