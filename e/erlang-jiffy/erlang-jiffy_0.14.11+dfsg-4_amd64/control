Description: JSON NIFs (Native Implemented Functions) for Erlang
 A JSON parser as a NIF (Native Implemented Functions). This is a complete
 rewrite of the work this was done in EEP0018 that was based on Yajl. This
 new version is a hand crafted state machine that does its best to be as
 quick and efficient as possible while not placing any constraints on the
 parsed JSON.
