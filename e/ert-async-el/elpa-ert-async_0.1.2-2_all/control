Description: asynchronous tests for the Emacs ERT testing framework
 This library provides the `ert-deftest-async' function for defining
 asynchronous tests for Emacs Lisp addon packages.  The user supplies
 a list of callbacks, and the test fails if it is not the case that
 all of the callbacks have been called after a defined number of
 seconds.
 .
 See the GNU Emacs documentation for general information on writing
 test suites with ERT.
