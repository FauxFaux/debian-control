Description: multimedia keyboard daemon for Linux
 ESE Key Daemon is a multimedia keyboard daemon for Linux. With the 2.6 kernel
 series it can also handle remote controls, as they are presented as keyboards.
 No kernel patch is required. It is a userspace program that pools
 /dev/input/event? interfaces for incoming keyboard key presses.
