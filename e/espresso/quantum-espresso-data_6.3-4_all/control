Description: Electronic-Structure and Ab-Initio Molecular Dynamics Suite (Documentation)
 Quantum ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of computer codes for
 electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling at the nanoscale. It
 is based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials (both
 norm-conserving, ultrasoft, and PAW).
 .
 This package contains a limited set of pseudo-potentials and example files.
