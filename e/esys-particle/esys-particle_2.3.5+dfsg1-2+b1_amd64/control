Description: Software for particle-based numerical modelling. MPI version.
 ESyS-Particle is Open Source software for particle-based numerical modelling.
 The software implements the Discrete Element Method (DEM), a widely used
 technique for modelling processes involving large deformations, granular flow
 and/or fragmentation. ESyS-Particle is designed for execution on parallel
 supercomputers, clusters or multi-core PCs running a Linux-based operating
 system. The C++ simulation engine implements spatial domain decomposition via
 the Message Passing Interface (MPI). A Python wrapper API provides flexibility
 in the design of numerical models, specification of modelling parameters and
 contact logic, and analysis of simulation data. ESyS-Particle has been
 utilised to simulate earthquake nucleation, comminution in shear cells, silo
 flow, rock fragmentation, and fault gouge evolution, to name but a few
 applications.
