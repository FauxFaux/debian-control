Description: tool to send magic Wake-on-LAN packets
 WOL (Wake-on-LAN) is a standard that allows you to turn on a computer
 over an Ethernet connection. Computers with WOL-enabled network
 interface cards can be woken from sleep mode, or powered up from
 standby via a BIOS feature.
 .
 One feature that separates etherwake from other implementations is that
 it also supports WOL passwords.
