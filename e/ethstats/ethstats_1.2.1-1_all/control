Description: script that quickly measures network device throughput
 ethstats works by parsing the /proc/net/dev file that the Linux kernel
 maintains, and thus utilizes a negligible amount of CPU time. ethstats
 shows the throughput of each device in both megabits per second and
 packets per second.
