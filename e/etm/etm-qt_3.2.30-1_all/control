Description: manages events and tasks using simple text files (dummy package)
 A simple, intuitive format for using plain text files to store data and
 a cross-platfrom, Qt-based GUI for creating and modifying items as well
 as viewing them in a variety of convenient ways. Supported alarms
 include display, sound, email, text message and process. Repetition is
 supported in a powerful and flexible manner.
 .
 This is a transitional package has been replaced by the Tk port, so this
 package is safe to remove.
