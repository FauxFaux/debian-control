Description: manages events and tasks using simple text files
 Manage events and tasks using simple text files
 etm is an acronym for event and task manager.
 .
 In contrast to most calendar/todo applications, creating items (events,
 tasks, and so forth) in etm does not require filling out fields in a
 form. Instead, items are created as free-form text entries using a
 simple, intuitive format and stored in plain text files.
