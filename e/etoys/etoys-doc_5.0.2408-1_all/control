Description: documentation for Etoys
 Squeak Etoys was inspired by LOGO, PARC-Smalltalk, Hypercard, and
 starLOGO.  It is a media-rich authoring environment with a simple
 powerful scripted object model for many kinds of objects created by
 end-users that runs on many platforms, and is free and open source.  It
 includes 2D and 3D graphics, images, text, particles, presentations,
 web-pages, videos, sound and MIDI, etc.  It includes the ability to
 share desktops with other Etoy users in real-time, so many forms of
 immersive mentoring and play can be done over the Internet.
 .
 These are the help files for Etoys and several examples of projects.
