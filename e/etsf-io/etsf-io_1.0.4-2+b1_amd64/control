Description: Binary tools to check, merge and read ETSF files
 The European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility (ETSF) is a European
 network dedicated to providing support and services for ongoing
 research in academic, government and industrial laboratories.
 .
 The ETSF is divided into 7 beamlines, each of which is concerned with
 a specific scientific topic:
  - Optics ;
  - Energy Loss Spectroscopy ;
  - Quantum Transport ;
  - Time-resolved Spectroscopy ;
  - Photo-emission Spectroscopy ;
  - Vibrational Spectroscopy ;
  - X-Rays Spectroscopy.
 .
 To allow the adoption of its recommendations about standardization, the
 ETSF proposes different libraries and tools implementing or using these
 specifications, as well as widely usable pieces of software.
 .
 ETSF_IO is a library of F90 routines to read/write the ETSF file format.
 This package contains the user tools to:
  - check file conformance to the specifications;
  - extract data from files;
  - merge multiple files from parallel runs, as specified in the
    specifications.
