Description: tools for interacting with AWS API-compatible services
 Command-line tools for interacting with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and other
 AWS-compatible services, such as Eucalyptus and OpenStack, that export a
 REST/Query-based API compatible with Amazon EC2, IAM, and S3 services.  The
 tools can be used with both Amazon's services and with installations of the
 Eucalyptus open-source cloud-computing infrastructure.  The tools were inspired
 by command-line tools distributed by Amazon (api-tools and ami-tools) and
 largely accept the same options and environment variables.  However, these
 tools were implemented from scratch in Python.
