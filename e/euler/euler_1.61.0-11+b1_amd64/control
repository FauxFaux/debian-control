Description: interactive mathematical programming environment
 Euler is a powerful numerical laboratory with a programming language.
 The system can handle real, complex and interval numbers, vectors and
 matrices. It can produce 2D/3D plots.
 .
 Euler features among other things:
  * real, complex and interval scalars and matrices
  * a programming language, with local variables, default values for
    parameters, variable parameter number, passing of functions
  * two and three dimensional graphs
  * marker plots
  * density and contour plots
  * animations
  * numerical integration and differentiation
  * statistical functions and tests
  * differential equations
  * interval methods with guaranteed inclusions
  * function minimizers (Brent, Nelder-Mean)
  * simplex algorithm
  * interpolation and approximation
  * finding roots of polynomials
  * fast Fourier transform (FFT)
  * an exact scalar product using a long accumulator
  * PostScript graphics export
 .
 This package contains the main program. Documentation for Euler is included
 in the euler-doc package.
