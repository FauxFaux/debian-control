Description: flexible OpenVPN authentication module
 This plug-in enhances OpenVPN by adding user name and password authentication.
 An eurephia user account is a combination of minimum one OpenVPN SSL
 certificate and a user name with a password assigned. It is also possible to
 setup several eurephia user names to use a shared OpenVPN certificate.
 .
 In addition, eurephia will blacklist IP addresses, certificates and user names
 on too many failed attempts and it supports dynamic update of iptables rules
 which restricts network access per connection.
 .
 All information is stored in a database and all changes to the accounts will
 be effective immediately. At the moment eurephia supports the SQLite database.
