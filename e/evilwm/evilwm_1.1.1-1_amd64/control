Description: minimalist window manager for X11
 evilwm is based on aewm by Decklin Foster. It's minimalist
 in that it omits unnecessary stuff like window decorations
 and icons. But it's very usable in that it provides good
 keyboard control with repositioning and maximize toggles,
 solid window drags, snap-to-border support, and virtual desktops.
