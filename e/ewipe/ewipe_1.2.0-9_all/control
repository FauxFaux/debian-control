Description: Yet another presentation tool based on Tcl/Tk
 Extended WIPE is a presentation tool written in Tcl/Tk.
 Unlike MagicPoint, the de facto standard in this realm,
 you can create resumes for presentation with user-friendly GUI,
 then save manuscripts in HTML and mgp(Magic Point file format).
