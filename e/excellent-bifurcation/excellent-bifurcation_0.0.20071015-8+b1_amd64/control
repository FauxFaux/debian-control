Description: abstract vertical shooter with two sides to play on
 Excellent Bifurcation is a vertical shooter in which you have two sides
 available to play on. Its graphics try to mimic the colours, sounds and
 feeling of the 8-bit games.
 .
 In the game, you drive two ships at the same time, on two sides of the
 screen. The game play is very unique and fun. It might be quite a brain
 bender anyway.
 .
 Excellent Bifurcation was Linley Henzel's entry in the AutoFire 2007 Shooter
 Competition, and finished in 2nd place.
