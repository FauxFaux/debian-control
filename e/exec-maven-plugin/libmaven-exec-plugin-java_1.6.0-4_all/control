Description: Exec Maven Plugin (transitional package)
 Maven plugin to allow execution of system and Java programs.
 It provides two goals to help execute system and Java programs:
  * exec:exec, execute programs and Java programs in a separate process
  * exec:java, execute Java programs in the same VM.
 .
 This is a dummy transitional package. It may be safely removed.
