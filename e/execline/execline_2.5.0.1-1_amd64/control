Description: small and non-interactive scripting language
 Execline is a (non-interactive) scripting language, like sh; but its
 syntax is quite different from a traditional shell syntax. The execlineb
 program is meant to be used as an interpreter for a text file; the other
 commands are essentially useful inside an execlineb script.
 .
 Execline is as powerful as a shell: it features conditional loops,
 getopt-style option handling, filename globbing, and more. Meanwhile, its
 syntax is far more logic and predictable than the shell's syntax, and has
 no security issues.
 .
 Execline binaries are installed in /usr/lib/execline/bin, please add it to
 PATH before using them.
