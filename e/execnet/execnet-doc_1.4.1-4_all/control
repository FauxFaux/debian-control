Description: rapid multi-Python deployment (docs)
 execnet provides carefully tested means to ad-hoc interact with Python
 interpreters across version, platform and network barriers. It provides
 a minimal and fast API targeting the following uses:
 .
  * distribute tasks to local or remote CPUs
  * write and deploy hybrid multi-process applications
  * write scripts to administer a bunch of exec environments
 .
 This package contains the documentation.
