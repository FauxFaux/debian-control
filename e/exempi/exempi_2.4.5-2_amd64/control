Description: command line tool to manipulate XMP metadata
 Exempi is a library to parse XMP metadata as defined by the
 specification.
 .
 XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform) facilitates embedding metadata in files
 using a subset of RDF. Most notably XMP supports embedding metadata in PDF
 and many image formats, though it is designed to support nearly any file type.
 .
 This package provides a command line tool to manipulate XMP metadata.
