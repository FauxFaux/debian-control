Description: read metadata from digital pictures
 Exifprobe reads image files produced by digital cameras (including
 several so-called "raw" file formats) and reports the structure of
 the files and the auxiliary data and metadata contained within them.
 .
 In addition to TIFF, JPEG and EXIF, the program understands several
 formats which may contain "raw" camera data, including MRW, CIFF/CRW,
 JP2/JPEG2000, RAF, and X3F, as well as most TIFF-derived "raw" formats,
 including DNG, ORF, CR2, NEF, K25/KDC/DCR and PEF.
 .
 This program is useful in forensics investigations.
