Description: EXIF/IPTC/XMP metadata manipulation library
 Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command line utility to manage image metadata.
 It provides fast and easy read and write access to the Exif, IPTC and XMP
 metadata of images in various formats
 .
 Exiv2 library provides:
  * fast read and write access to the Exif, IPTC, and XMP metadata of an image
  * an easy to use and extensively documented API
  * conversions of Exif and IPTC metadata to XMP and vice versa
  * a smart IPTC implementation that does not affect data that programs like
    Photoshop store in the same image segment
  * Exif Makernote support:
    - Makernote tags can be read and written just like any other metadata
    - a sophisticated write algorithm avoids corrupting the Makernote
  * a simple interface to extract previews embedded in RAW images and Exif
    thumbnails
  * set and delete methods for Exif thumbnails
