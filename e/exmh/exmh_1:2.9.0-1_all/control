Description: extensible X user interface for MH mail
 Exmh uses the regular MH programs to manipulate your mail folders and
 messages.  This means it is compatible with command-line use of MH
 programs, and its actions should be familiar if you are an experienced
 MH user.  If you are a new MH user, then the details of running MH
 programs are hidden behind the graphical interface.
