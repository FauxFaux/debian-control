Description: hardware & software framework for developing science experiments
 This package provides high level interfaces for making science experiments
 with an ExpEYES-17 box.
 .
 ExpEYES-17 is from the PHOENIX project of Inter-University Accelerator
 Centre, New Delhi. It is a hardware & software framework for
 developing science experiments, demonstrations and projects and learn
 science and engineering by exploration. Capable of doing real time
 measurements and analysing the data in different ways. When compared with
 previous ExpEYES boxes (Expeyes, Expeyes-Junior), ExpEYES-17 is richer
 in various features: multiple soft input ranges, more flexible wave
 generator, better time resolution, better voltage resolution, supports
 seamlessly cheap I2C sensors.
