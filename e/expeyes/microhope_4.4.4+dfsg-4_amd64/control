Description: hardware & software framework to learn microcontrollers
 This package provides a set of example programs to drive an ATmega32
 microcontroller, together with a tutorial explaining how to compile
 them, upload them to the microcontroller, and how to make simple and
 more complicated modifications. It is meant to be used with the
 "microhope" board which makes it easy to upload code to the microcontroller
 through a USB link.
 .
 In addition to examples there is a library to drive all of the peripherals
 available on the "microhope" board: LED, LCD display, ADC connected to
 sensors.
 .
 A Graphic User Interface is provided too.
