Description: Python3 library for expeyes
 This package provides low level interfaces for making science experiments
 with an ExpEYES box. The library allows one to develop new programs easily
 .
 ExpEYES is from the PHOENIX project of Inter-University Accelerator
 Centre, New Delhi. It is a hardware & software framework for
 developing science experiments, demonstrations and projects and learn
 science and engineering by exploration. Capable of doing real time
 measurements and analysing the data in different ways. Analog
 voltages are measured with 0.025% resolution and time intervals with
 one microsecond. This project is based on Free and Open Source
 software, mostly written in Python programming language. The hardware
 design is also open.
