Description: HTML5 Canvas for Internet Explorer
 Modern browsers like Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Opera support the HTML5
 canvas tag to allow 2D command-based drawing. ExplorerCanvas brings the same
 functionality to Internet Explorer. To use, web developers only need to include
 a single script tag in their existing web pages.
