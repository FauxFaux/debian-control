Description: 3D racing game featuring Tux, the Linux penguin
 Extreme Tux Racer, or etracer as it is called for short, is a simple OpenGL
 racing game featuring Tux, the Linux mascot. The goal of the game is to slide
 down a snow- and ice-covered mountain as quickly as possible, avoiding the
 trees and rocks that will slow you down.
 .
 Collect herrings and other goodies while sliding down the hill, but avoid fish
 bones.
 .
 This game is based on the GPL version of the famous game TuxRacer.
 .
 You must have working 3D acceleration or this game will run quite slowly.
