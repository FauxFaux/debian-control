Description: tools for editing and viewing exult games
 Includes:
 .
   expack       - Command line tool for creating and extracting Flex (.flx)
                  files. Flex files are used by Ultima 7 to store most
                  of its data.
   splitshp     - Command line tool to take a multi-frame shp file and
                  split it into its individual frames.
   shp2pcx      - Command line tool to convert shp files to pcx format;
                  the shp files can be extracted using expack.
   ucxt         - Tool to translate usecode back into `human readable',
                  roughly assembly like code. The output can be presented
                  in a variety of different format, including one which
                  will, later, have a suitable compiler back into usecode.
   ucc          - A usecode compiler.
   exult_studio - An editor for games using the Exult engine.
 .
 These are all works in progress.

 A GIMP plugin is provided, so that if you have the GIMP installed you
 can edit and create game graphics with it.
