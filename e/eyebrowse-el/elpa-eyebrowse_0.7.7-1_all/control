Description: simple-minded way of managing window configs in Emacs
 This package provides a global minor mode for Emacs that allows one
 to manage window configurations in a simple manner, just like tiling
 window managers like i3wm with their workspaces do. It displays their
 current state in the modeline by default. The behaviour is modeled
 after ranger, a file manager written in Python.
