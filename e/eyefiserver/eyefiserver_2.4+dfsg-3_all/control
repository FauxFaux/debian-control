Description: Daemon to receive images from Eye-Fi SD card
 EyeFi cards are SD cards that embed a small wifi chip. You can put one
 in your camera and receive the pictures automagically on your wifi
 network.
 .
 Unfortunately, these cards use a proprietary protocol only available on
 windows and macos.
 .
 This package will provide a compatible HTTP server, listening on port
 59278, that enables you to receive your pictures on your favorite os.
