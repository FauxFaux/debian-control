Description: easy media streaming client over icecast servers
 Ezstream is an audio and video streaming client which feeds any icecast server
 with audio data and metadata from a standard input without reencoding.
 It thus requires very little CPU resources. Some playlists can be looped and
 composed with MP3, Ogg Vorbis or Ogg Theora media files.
 Shoutcast metadata are also supported.
