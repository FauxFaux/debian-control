Description: test real flash memory capacity
 F3 (Fight Flash Fraud or Fight Fake Flash) tests the full capacity of a
 flash card (flash drive, flash disk, pendrive).
 .
 F3 writes to the card and then checks if can read it. It will assure you
 have not been bought a card with a smaller capacity than stated. Note that
 the main goal of F3 is not to fix your removable media. However, there
 are resources to mark the invalid areas.
 .
 This package provides these executables: f3write, f3read, f3brew, f3fix
 and f3probe.
