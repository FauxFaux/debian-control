Description: simple face detector for batch processing
 Facedetect is a simple face detector for batch processing. It answers
 the basic question: "Is there a face in this image?" and gives back
 either an exit code or the coordinates of each detected face in the
 standard output.
 .
 The aim is to provide a basic command-line interface that's consistent
 and easy to use with software such as ImageMagick, while progressively
 improving the detection algorithm over time.
 .
 facedetect is used in software such as fgallery to improve the thumbnail
 cutting region, so that faces are always centered.
