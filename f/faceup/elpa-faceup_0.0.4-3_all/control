Description: Regression test system for font-lock
 Emacs is capable of highlighting buffers based on language-specific
 `font-lock' rules. This package, `faceup', makes it possible to
 perform regression test for packages that provide font-lock rules.
 The underlying idea is to convert text with highlights ("faces")
 into a plain text representation using the Faceup markup language.
