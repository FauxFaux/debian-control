Description: functional constraint library implemented in Objective Caml
 FaCiLe is a constraint programming library over integer finite domain
 written in Objective Caml. It offers all usual facilities to create
 and manipulate finite domain variables, arithmetic expressions and
 constraints (possibly non-linear), built-in global constraints and
 search goals. FaCiLe allows as well to build easily user-defined
 constraints and goals (including recursive ones), making pervasive use
 of OCaml higher-order functionals to provide a simple and flexible
 interface for the user. As FaCiLe is an OCaml library and not "yet
 another language", the user benefits from type inference and strong
 typing discipline, high level of abstraction, modules and objects
 system, as well as native code compilation efficiency, garbage
 collection and replay debugger, all features of OCaml (among many
 others) that allow to prototype and experiment quickly: modeling, data
 processing and interface are implemented with the same powerful and
 efficient language.
