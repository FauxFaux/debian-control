Description: collect and display facts about the system
 Facter is Puppetâ€™s cross-platform system profiling library. It discovers and
 reports per-node facts, which are collected by the Puppet agent and are made
 available in Puppet manifests as variables. Facter comes with a number of
 built-in facts providing information about the operating system, hardware, SSH
 keys, etc., but is also easily extensible through the following interfaces:
 .
  * Through custom facts using Facter's Ruby API.
  * Through `external' facts which can be either executables, or static data
    files.
 .
 This package contains the facter binary and the ruby module making facter
 available to Puppet.
