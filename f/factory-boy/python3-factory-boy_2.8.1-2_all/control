Description: test fixtures replacement based on factory_girl for Ruby - Python 3.x
 factory_boy is a fixtures replacement based on thoughtbot's factory_girl. Like
 factory_girl it has a straightforward definition syntax, support for multiple
 build strategies (saved instances, unsaved instances, attribute dicts, and
 stubbed objects), and support for multiple factories for the same class,
 including factory  inheritance.
 .
 Django support is included, and support for other ORMs can be easily added.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3.x module.
