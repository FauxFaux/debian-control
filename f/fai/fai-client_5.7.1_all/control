Description: Fully Automatic Installation client package
 FAI is a non-interactive system to install, customize and manage
 Linux systems and software configurations on computers as well as
 virtual machines and chroot environments, from small networks to
 large infrastructures and clusters.

 This is the client package for FAI. It contains the parts necessary
 to run the softupdate functionality on already installed systems, and
 is needed for the dirinstall functionality and others on a FAI server.
