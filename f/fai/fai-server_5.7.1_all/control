Description: Fully Automatic Installation server package
 FAI is a non-interactive system to install, customize and manage
 Linux systems and software configurations on computers as well as
 virtual machines and chroot environments, from small networks to
 large infrastructures and clusters.
 .
 It's a tool for mass unattended Linux installation. You can take one
 or more virgin systems, turn on the power, and after a few minutes,
 the systems are installed, and completely configured to your exact
 needs, without any interaction necessary.
 .
 This package is needed for setting up a FAI install server for network
 installations, for running the dirinstall in a chroot environment, and
 to build installation CD/DVD's and USB sticks.
