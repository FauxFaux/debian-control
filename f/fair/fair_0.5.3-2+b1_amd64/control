Description: high availability load balancer for TCP connections
 Fair is a system for implementing load balancers; it consists of two daemons:
 carrousel and transponder. Carrousel, which performs load balancing services,
 typically runs on a load balancer; transponder runs on the servers.
 .
 Fair understands network topologies where one node is reachable via more than
 one IP address; this allows not only the servers, but the network to be
 redundant as well. This distinguishes fair from other load balancers.
