Description: Gives a fake root environment
 This is a clean reimplementation of the fakeroot command. Just like it,
 anything run within the fake root command will assume it is running as root.
 Unlike it, fakeroot-ng is not based on LD_PRELOAD but on ptrace.
 .
 The practical upshot of this is that the technology supports intercepting the
 "open" system call. In particular, this allows simulating the "chroot" command
 reliably.
 .
 Another important difference is that fakeroot-ng can fool applications that do
 not perform system calls through glibc, such as statically linked executables
 and programs written in some non-C languages (like the latest Sun JDK).
