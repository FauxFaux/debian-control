Description: File Alteration Monitor
 FAM monitors files and directories, notifying interested applications
 of changes.
 .
 This package provides a server that can monitor a given list of files
 and notify applications through a socket.  If the kernel supports
 dnotify (kernels >= 2.4.x) FAM is notified directly by the kernel.
 Otherwise it has to poll the files' status.  FAM can also provide an
 RPC service for monitoring remote files (such as on a mounted NFS
 filesystem).
