Description: Fake ARP user space daemon
 This ARP daemon replies to any ARP request for a set of IP addresses
 with the hardware MAC address of one of the interfaces of the
 server after determining that no other host in the network is claiming
 that IP.
 .
 This enables a single host to claim all unassigned addresses on a
 LAN for network monitoring or simulation purposes.
