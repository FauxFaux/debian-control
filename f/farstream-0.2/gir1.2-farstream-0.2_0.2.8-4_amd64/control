Description: Audio/Video communications framework: GObject-Introspection
 The Farstream project is an effort to create a framework to deal with all
 known audio/video conferencing protocols. On one side it offers a generic
 API that makes it possible to write plugins for different streaming
 protocols, on the other side it offers an API for clients to use those
 plugins.
 .
 It can be used by packages using the GIRepository format to generate dynamic
 bindings.
