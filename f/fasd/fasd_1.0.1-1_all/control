Description: command-line productivity booster
 Fasd (pronounced similar to "fast") is a command-line productivity booster.
 Fasd offers quick access to files and directories for POSIX shells. It is
 inspired by tools like autojump, z and v. Fasd keeps track of files and
 directories you have accessed, so that you can quickly reference them in the
 command line.
 .
 The name fasd comes from the default suggested aliases f(files),
 a(files/directories), s(show/search/select), d(directories).
