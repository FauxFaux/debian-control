Description: Fast C++ CSV Parser
 fast-cpp-cvs-parser is a small, easy-to-use and fast header-only
 library for reading comma separated value (CSV) files. The library
 is completely contained inside a single header file. The library
 can used with a standard conformant C++11 compiler.
 .
 Feature list:
  * Automatically rearranges columns by parsing the header line.
  * Disk I/O and CSV-parsing are overlapped using threads for efficiency.
  * Parsing features such as escaped strings can be enabled and disabled
    at compile time using templates.
  * Can read multiple GB files in reasonable time.
  * Support for custom columns separators (i.e. Tab separated value files
    are supported), quote escaped strings, automatic space trimming.
  * Works with *nix and Windows newlines and automatically ignores UTF-8 BOMs.
  * Exception classes with enough context to format useful error messages.
  * what() returns error messages ready to be shown to a user.
