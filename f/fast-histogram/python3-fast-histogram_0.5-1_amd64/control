Description: Fast 1D and 2D histogram functions in Python
 fast-histogram aims to provide simple and fast histogram functions for
 regular bins that don't compromise on performance. It doesn't do
 anything complicated - it just implements a simple histogram algorithm in C and
 keeps it simple. The aim is to have functions that are fast but also robust and
 reliable. The result is a 1D histogram function here that is 7-15x faster than
 numpy.histogram, and a 2D histogram function that is 20-25x faster than
 numpy.histogram2d.
