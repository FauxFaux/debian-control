Description: Tool for construction of phylogenetic trees of DNA sequences
 fastDNAml is a program derived from Joseph Felsenstein's version 3.3 DNAML
 (part of his PHYLIP package).  Users should consult the documentation for
 DNAML before using this program.
 .
 fastDNAml is an attempt to solve the same problem as DNAML, but to do so
 faster and using less memory, so that larger trees and/or more bootstrap
 replicates become tractable.  Much of fastDNAml is merely a recoding of the
 PHYLIP 3.3 DNAML program from PASCAL to C.
 .
 Note that the homepage of this program is not available any more and so
 this program will probably not see any further updates.
