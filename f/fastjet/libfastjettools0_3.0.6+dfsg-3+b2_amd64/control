Description: Tools for FastJet
 The FastJet package provides a fast implementation of several longitudinally
 invariant sequential recombination jet algorithms, in particular the
 longitudinally invariant kt jet algorithm, the inclusive longitudinally
 invariant version of the Cambridge/Aachen jet-algorithm, and the inclusive
 anti-kt algorithm.
 .
 FastJet also provides a uniform interface to external jet finders via a plugin
 mechanism, and tools for calculating jet areas and performing background
 (pileup/UE) subtraction.
 .
 This package provides various tools related to jet areas and subtraction. They
 can be used with any infrared safe jet algorithm, both native and plugin.
