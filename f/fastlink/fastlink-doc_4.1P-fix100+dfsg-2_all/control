Description: Some papers about fastlink
 Genetic linkage analysis is a statistical technique used to map
 genes and find the approximate location of disease genes. There
 was a standard software package for genetic linkage called
 LINKAGE. FASTLINK is a significantly modified and improved
 version of the main programs of LINKAGE that runs much faster
 sequentially, can run in parallel, allows the user to recover
 gracefully from a computer crash, and provides abundant new
 documentation. FASTLINK has been used in over 1000 published
 genetic linkage studies.
 .
 You do not really need these papers about fastlink but it is highly
