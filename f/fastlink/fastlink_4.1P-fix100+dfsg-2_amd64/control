Description: faster version of pedigree programs of Linkage
 Genetic linkage analysis is a statistical technique used to map
 genes and find the approximate location of disease genes. There
 was a standard software package for genetic linkage called
 LINKAGE. FASTLINK is a significantly modified and improved
 version of the main programs of LINKAGE that runs much faster
 sequentially, can run in parallel, allows the user to recover
 gracefully from a computer crash, and provides abundant new
 documentation. FASTLINK has been used in over 1000 published
 genetic linkage studies.
 .
 This package contains the following programs:
  ilink:    GEMINI optimization procedure to find a locally
            optimal value of the theta vector of recombination
            fractions
  linkmap:  calculates location scores of one locus against a
            fixed map of other loci
  lodscore: compares likelihoods at locally optimal theta
  mlink:    calculates lod scores and risk with two of more loci
  unknown:  identify possible genotypes for unknowns
