Description: quality control for high throughput sequence data
 FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on
 raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It
 provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick
 impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should
 be aware before doing any further analysis.
 .
 The main functions of FastQC are
  * Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)
  * Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may
    be problems
  * Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data
  * Export of results to an HTML based permanent report
  * Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without
    running the interactive application
