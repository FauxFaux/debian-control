Description: Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapper in cis for molecular phenotypes
 The goal of FastQTL is to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
 which are significantly associated with various molecular phenotypes
 (i.e. expression of known genes, cytosine methylation levels, etc).
 It performs scans for all possible phenotype-variant pairs in cis
 (i.e. variants located within a specific window around a phenotype).
 FastQTL implements a new permutation scheme (Beta approximation) to accurately
 and rapidly correct for multiple-testing at both the genotype and phenotype
 levels.
