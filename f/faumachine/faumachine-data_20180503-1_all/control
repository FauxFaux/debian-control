Description: Virtual machine running in user mode -- data files
 FAUmachine is a virtual machine that can simulate PC hardware like QEMU.
 Its main focus is to simulate the real hardware as close as possible.
 .
 FAUmachine comes with the ability to inject faults to different hardware
 simulators, e.g. to inject intermittent or transient faults to the simulated
 disk or the simulated memory.
 .
 FAUmachine also comes with an experiment controller, with which automated
 tests, like installing an operating system from an iso image, can be run.
 .
 This package contains the architecture independent data files.
