Description: simple server to run CGI applications over FastCGI
 fcgiwrap is a simple server for running CGI applications over FastCGI.
 Its goal is to provide clean CGI support to the nginx webserver, although
 can be used with others.
 .
 fcgiwrap is lightweight and has no configuration, making it possible to
 use the same pool to run different sites.
