Description: Flexible Input Method Framework - KIMPanel protocol module
 Fcitx is a input method framework with extension support, which provides
 an interface for entering characters of different scripts in applications
 using a variety of mapping systems.
 .
 It offers a pleasant and modern experience, with intuitive graphical
 configuration tools and customizable skins and mapping tables. It is
 highly modularized and extensible, with GTK+ 2/3 and Qt4 IM Modules, support
 for UIs based on Fbterm, pure Xlib, GTK+, or KDE, and a developer-friendly
 API.
 .
 This package provides the KIMPanel protocol module of Fcitx, which
 implements a protocol to talk with D-Bus and is usually needed by the
 plugin for environments like KIMPanel/(Q)KIMToy, GNOME Shell and Unity.
