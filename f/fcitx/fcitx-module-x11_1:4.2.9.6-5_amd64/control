Description: Flexible Input Method Framework - X11 module and XIM frontend
 Fcitx is a input method framework with extension support, which provides
 an interface for entering characters of different scripts in applications
 using a variety of mapping systems.
 .
 It offers a pleasant and modern experience, with intuitive graphical
 configuration tools and customizable skins and mapping tables. It is
 highly modularized and extensible, with GTK+ 2/3 and Qt4 IM Modules, support
 for UIs based on Fbterm, pure Xlib, GTK+, or KDE, and a developer-friendly
 API.
 .
 This package provides the X11 module, X11 utilities used by other addons
 such as fcitx-ui-classic, and is required for all desktop users. An Xlibs
 based virtual keyboard module has been also included in this package for
 it's an obvious feature needed by many desktop users.
 .
 XIM frontend (client) is placed in this package too because of its nature
 of being the basic input protocol supported by X.
