Description: read and write problems from the Friction Contact Library (library)
 fclib is an open source collection of Frictional Contact (FC)
 problems stored in a specific HDF5 format, and an open source light
 implementation of Input/Output functions in C Language to read and
 write problems.
 .
 The goal of this work is to set up a collection of 2D and 3D
 Frictional Contact (FC) problems in order to set up a list of
 benchmarks; provide a standard framework for testing available and
 new algorithms; and share common formulations of problems in order to
 exchange data.
 .
 Fclib is an open-source scientific software primarily targeted at
 modeling and simulating nonsmooth dynamical systems
 .
 This package includes the libfclib libraries.
