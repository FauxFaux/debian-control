Description: Flexible Configuration Manager
 FCM is a set of tools for managing and building source code.
 FCM uses Subversion for code management but defines a common process
 and naming convention to simplify usage.
 It adds a layer on top of Subversion to provide a more natural and
 user-friendly interface.
 .
 FCM features a powerful build system, mainly aimed at building modern
 Fortran software applications.
