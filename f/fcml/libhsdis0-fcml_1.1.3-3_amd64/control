Description: HotSpot disassembler plugin using FCML
 This HotSpot plugin enables the PrintAssembly series of options in
 the JRE's HotSpot VM. It allows the binary code generated by the JIT
 compiler to be disassembled and logged.
 .
 This plugin is based on the FCML library, not on binutils (unlike the
 OpenJDK hsdis plugin).
