Description: Python3 DB-API driver for Firebird
 FDB is a Python library package that implements Python Database API
 2.0-compliant support for the open source relational database FirebirdÂ®.
 In addition to the minimal feature set of the standard Python DB API,
 FDB also exposes nearly the entire native client API of the database
 engine.  This version installs the Python3 byte code.
 .
 FDB is a replacement for python-kinterbasdb, which is no longer
 maintained by upstream.
