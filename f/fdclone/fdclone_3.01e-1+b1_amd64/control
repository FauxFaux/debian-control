Description: console-base lightweight file manager
 FD (FD represents "File and Directory") is an easy-to-use
 file management tool for Un*x newbies.  As its name shows,
 this is a rewrite from scratch - the original version was written
 by Atsushi Idei for MS-DOS(tm) and once very popular in Japan.
 Messages are available either in English or in Japanese.
