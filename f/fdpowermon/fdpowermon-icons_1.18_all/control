Description: icons for fdpowermon
 fdpowermon is a simple perl script that installs an icon in a system
 tray compatible with the freedesktop.org specification.
 .
 By default, it uses an icon set from the 'oxygen' icon theme. However,
 that icon theme is fairly large (several tens of megabytes), which is a
 waste if the oxygen-icon-theme package is not installed for other
 reasons. Therefore, this package contains just those icons from the
 oxygen-icon-theme package that are needed by fdpowermon, and nothing
 more.
