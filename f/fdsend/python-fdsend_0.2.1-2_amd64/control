Description: Provides an abstraction for file descriptor passing via sockets
 fdsend is yet another file descriptor passing abstraction, specifically for
 Python. This package offers a few conveniences not commonly found together in
 other abstractions: sending multiple files at once, sending arbitrary data,
 and working with both files and file descriptors.
