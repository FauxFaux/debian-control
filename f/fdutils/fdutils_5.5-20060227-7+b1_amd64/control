Description: Linux floppy utilities
 This package contains utilities for formatting extra capacity
 disks, automatic floppy disk mounting and unmounting, etc.
 .
 The package includes the following items:
 .
  - superformat: formats high capacity disks (up to 1992k
    for high density disks or up to 3984k for extra density
     disks);
  - fdmount: automatically mounts/unmounts disks when they are
    inserted/removed;
  - xdfcopy: formats, reads and writes OS/2's XDF disks;
  - MAKEFLOPPIES: creates the floppy devices in /dev;
  - getfdprm: prints the current disk geometry (number of
    sectors, track and heads etc.);
  - setfdprm: sets the current disk geometry;
  - fdrawcmd: sends raw commands to the floppy driver;
  - floppycontrol: configures the floppy driver;
  - general documentation about the floppy driver.
 .
 Note that these utilities do not work for USB floppy drives, because
 these do not allow direct access to the floppy controller.
