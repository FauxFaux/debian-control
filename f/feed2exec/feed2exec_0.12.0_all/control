Description: programmable feed reader
 feed2exec is a simple program that runs custom actions on new RSS
 feed items (or whatever feedparser can read). It currently has
 support for writing into mailboxes (Maildir or mbox folders) or
 executing commands, but more actions can be easily implemented
 through plugins. Email are saved as multipart plain/HTML and can be
 sent to arbitrary folders.
