Description: feed aggregator (RSS/Atom) which puts items on a IMAP mail server
 Feed2Imap is an RSS/Atom feed aggregator. After Downloading
 feeds (over HTTP or HTTPS), it uploads them to a specified
 folder of an IMAP mail server. The user can then access the
 feeds using a mail reader like Mutt, Evolution, Mozilla
 Thunderbird or even a webmail.
 .
 The main advantage over rss2email is that feed2imap uploads
 emails itself to a specified folder. You don't have to play
 with procmail or your MUA's filtering rules to classify mails.
