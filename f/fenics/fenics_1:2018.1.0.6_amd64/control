Description: Automated Solution of Differential Equations
 FEniCS is a collection of free software for automated, efficient
 solution of differential equations.
 .
 FEniCS has an extensive list of features, including automated
 solution of variational problems, automated error control and
 adaptivity, a comprehensive library of finite elements, high
 performance linear algebra and many more.
 .
 FEniCS is organized as a collection of interoperable components,
 including the problem-solving environment DOLFIN, the form compiler
 FFC, the finite element tabulator FIAT, the just-in-time compiler
 Instant, the code generation interface UFC, the form language UFL and
 a range of additional components.
 .
 This is a metapackage which depends on all FEniCS components.
