Description: tool for assembling Illumina short reads in small regions
 Fml-asm is a command-line tool for assembling Illumina short reads in regions
 from 100bp to 10 million bp in size, based on the fermi-lite library.
 It is largely a light-weight in-memory version of fermikit without
 generating any intermediate files. It inherits the performance, the relatively
 small memory footprint and the features of fermikit. In particular, fermi-lite
 is able to retain heterozygous events and thus can be used to assemble diploid
 regions for the purpose of variant calling.
