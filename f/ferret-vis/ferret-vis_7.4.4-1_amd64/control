Description: Interactive data visualization and analysis environment
 Ferret is an interactive computer visualization and analysis environment
 designed to meet the needs of oceanographers and meteorologists analyzing
 large and complex gridded data sets. It can transparently access extensive
 remote Internet data bases using OPeNDAP (formerly known as DODS)
 .
 Ferret has a Mathematica-like flexibility, geophysical formatting,
 "intelligent" connection to its data base, memory management for very large
 calculations, and symmetrical processing in 4 dimensions. It can work on both
 gridded and non-gridded datasets.
