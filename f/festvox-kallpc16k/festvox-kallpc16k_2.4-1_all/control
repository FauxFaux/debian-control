Description: American English male speaker for festival, 16khz sample rate
 This is a diphone database for festival that uses 16k samples for high
 quality sound output. This is a large database (6 MB), and festival will
 convert text to speech more slowly using it, so you might want to install
 festvox-kallpc8k instead if you have low disk space or a slow computer.
 .
 The voice contained in this database is an American English male speaker.
 A different American English voice can be found in the festvox-kdlpc16k
 package if you dislike this one.
