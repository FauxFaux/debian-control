Description: American English male speaker for festival, 8khz sample rate
 This is a diphone database for festival that uses 8k samples so it takes up
 a minimum of disk space. Using this diphone database, festival also converts
 text to speech faster than with the 16k version. However, the sound quality
 is not as good.
 .
 The voice contained in this database is an American English male speaker.
 A different American English voice can be found in the festvox-kdlpc16k
 package if you dislike this one.
