Description: British English male speaker for festival, 16khz sample rate
 This is a diphone database for festival that uses 16k samples for high
 quality sound output. This is a large database (9 MB), and festival will
 convert text to speech more slowly using it, so you might want to install
 festvox-rablpc8k instead if you have low disk space or a slow computer.
 .
 The voice contained in this database is a British English male speaker.
