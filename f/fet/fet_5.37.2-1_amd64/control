Description: timetable generator
 FET is a program for automatically generating the timetable
 of a school, high-school or university.
 .
 Usually, FET is able to solve a complicated timetable in maximum 5-20 minutes.
 For simpler timetables, it may take a shorter time, under 5 minutes (in some
 cases, a matter of seconds). For extremely difficult timetables, it may take
 a longer time, a matter of hours.
