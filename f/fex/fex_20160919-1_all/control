Description: web service for transferring very large files
 F*EX (Frams's Fast File EXchange) is a service that can be used to allow
 users anywhere on the Internet to exchange very large files quickly and
 conveniently.
 .
 The sender uploads the file to the F*EX-server and the recipient
 automatically gets a notification e-mail with a download-URL.
 .
 Main features of F*EX:
 .
  * file transfer of virtually unlimited file size
  * sender and recipient only need an e-mail program and a web browser
    (of any kind; they do not have to install any software)
  * RESEND and REGET for resuming after link failures at last sent byte
  * auto-notification of recipient
  * auto-deletion after download
  * auto-deletion after expiration date (default: 5 days)
  * full-users can create one time upload URLs for foreign users
  * full-users can create sub-users, who can send only to this full-user
  * full-users can create groups, an analogy to mailing lists, but for files
  * admin can allow (internal or external) user self-registration
  * admin can allow upload to public recipients without authentication
  * admin can allow upload for LAN users without registration (anonymous upload)
  * maintenance-free: no administration necessary beyond creating new
    F*EX accounts
  * multiple recipients only require one stored copy
  * F*EX uses HTTP and needs no firewall tunnels
  * support for streams, too (SEX: Stream EXchange)
  * shell clients provided for commandline users: fexsend and fexget.
