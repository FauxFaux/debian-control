Description: foreign function call libraries - calling C functions with variable arguments
 ffcall is a collection of libraries which can be used to build
 foreign function call interfaces in embedded interpreters.
 .
 This package installs a shared library version of the avcall library, which
 can be used for calling C functions with variable arguments.
 .
 The use of this shared library is deprecated. The main libffcall library,
 which embeds avcall, should be preferred.
