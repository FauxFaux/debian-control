Description: foreign function call libraries - closures in C (non-reentrant variant)
 ffcall is a collection of libraries which can be used to build
 foreign function call interfaces in embedded interpreters.
 .
 This package installs a shared library version of the trampoline library,
 which implements closures as first-class C functions. This is a non-reentrant
 variant of part of the 'callback' library.
