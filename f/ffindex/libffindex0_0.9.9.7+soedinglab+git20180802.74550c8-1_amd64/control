Description: library for simple index/database for huge amounts of small files
 FFindex is a very simple index/database for huge amounts of small files. The
 files are stored concatenated in one big data file, separated by '\0'. A
 second file contains a plain text index, giving name, offset and length of
 the small files. The lookup is currently done with a binary search on an
 array made from the index file.
 .
 This package provides the shared library.
