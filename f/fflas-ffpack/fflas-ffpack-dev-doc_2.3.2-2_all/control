Description: FFLAS-FFPACK Developer Documentation
 FFLAS-FFPACK consists in the creation of a set of routines, giving
 the same tools as a set of classical Basic Linear Algebra
 Subroutines, but working over finite fields. In the same way, some
 other routines of higher level (such as the one in LAPACK) are also
 produced.
 .
 This package provides developer's documentation of FFLAS-FFPACK.
