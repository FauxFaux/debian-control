Description: FFmpeg library with extra filters (metapackage)
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This metapackage depends on the latest version of the libavfilter variant
 that offers additional filter support. Application packages can depend
 on it if they require or suggest this variant in a robust manner.
