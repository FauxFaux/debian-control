Description: static HTML+JavaScript photo album generator
 “fgallery” is a static photo gallery generator with no frills that has a
 stylish, minimalist look. “fgallery” shows your photos, and nothing else.

 There is no server-side processing, only static generation. The resulting
 gallery can be uploaded anywhere without additional requirements and works with
 any modern browser.

  * Automatically orients pictures without quality loss.
  * Multi-camera friendly: automatically sorts pictures by time: just throw your
    (and your friends) photos and movies in a directory. The resulting gallery
    shows the pictures in seamless shooting order.
  * Adapts to the current screen size and proportions, switching from
    horizontal/vertical layout and scaling thumbnails automatically.
  * Includes original (raw) pictures in a zip file for downloading.
  * Panoramas can be seen full-size by default.
