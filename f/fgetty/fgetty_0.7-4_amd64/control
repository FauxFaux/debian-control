Description: very small, efficient, console-only getty and login
 fgetty is a small, efficient, console-only getty for Linux.  It is derived
 from mingetty but hacked until it would link against diet libc to produce
 the smallest memory footprint possible for a simple yet complete getty.
 .
 fgetty includes a login program that supports the checkpassword
 authentication interface, and also a checkpassword program that uses the
 standard C library interface to passwd and shadow.
