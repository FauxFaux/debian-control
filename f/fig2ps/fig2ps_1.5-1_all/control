Description: Converts xfig files into ps, eps or pdf files using LaTeX for processing text
 This perl script takes into advantage the pstex and pstex_t export
 formats of fig2dev (xfig) to separate special text and the rest of a xfig
 file. Then, the text is processed separately using LaTeX, and
 everything is put back together at the end, to make a nice wonderful
 figure with the text formatted exactly the same way as the article you
 are typing ! PDF output is also available.
 .
 Though gv is strictly speaking not necessary for conversion, it can
 be called directly by fig2ps depending on the options you choose.
 For nice PDF output, you should install Type 1 fonts, such as lmodern
 or cm-super.
