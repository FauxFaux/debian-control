Description: parametric equalizer LADSPA plugin
 Four-band parametric equaliser. Each section has an active/bypass switch,
 frequency, bandwidth and gain controls. There is also a global bypass
 switch and gain control.
 .
 The 2nd order resonant filters are implemented using a Mitra-Regalia
 style lattice filter, which has the nice property of being stable
 even while parameters are being changed.
 .
 All switches and controls are internally smoothed, so they can
 be used 'live' without any clicks or zipper noises. This should
 make this plugin a good candidate for use in systems that allow
 automation of plugin control ports, such as Ardour, or for
 stage use.
