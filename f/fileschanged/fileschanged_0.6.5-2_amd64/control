Description: command-line utility that reports when files have been altered
 This software is a client to FAM (File Alteration Monitor).
 You can use fileschanged in shell scripts to take action when monitored files
 become altered. In it's simplest form, you can give filenames to monitor from
 standard-input, and it will report when those files have changed via
 standard-output. In a more complex usage, fileschanged can monitor
 command-line specified files recursively, while following symbolic links,
 while staying on the current filesystem, and reporting deleted files as well
 as created and changed files that haven't been written to for 2 seconds.
