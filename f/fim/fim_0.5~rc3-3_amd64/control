Description: scriptable frame buffer, X.org and ascii art image viewer
 FIM is a highly customizable scriptable image viewer targeted at the
 users who are comfortable with software like the Vim text editor or the Mutt
 mail user agent. FIM aims to be a "swiss army knife" for viewing images.
 Its code derives from the "Fbi" framebuffer image viewer by Gerd Hoffmann.
 FIM is multidevice: it has X support via the SDL library and ascii art output
 via the aalib library.
 .
 It supports image description files, file search and filtering using regular
 expressions on filenames and descriptions, caption display, customizable
 status line, EXIF tags display, EXIF-based image rotation, recursive directory
 traversal, reading from stdin, and can e.g. jump between two images
 remembering scale and position.
 .
 It can speed up loading by image caching and speed up scaling with mipmaps.
 It offers GNU readline command line autocompletion and history,
 completely customizable key bindings, external/internal (if-while based)
 scriptability (through return codes, standard input/output, and commands given
 at invocation time, an initialization file, Vim-like autocommands), and much
 more.
