Description: quick access to project files in Emacs
 This program provides a couple methods for quickly finding any file
 in a given project. It depends on GNU Find.
 .
 By default, it will automatically search files in a directory managed
 by git/subversion/mercurial. But you can easily switch to other types
 of projects.
 .
 Features:
 .
   * Fast! Tested with projects that have 50,000+ files
   * You can tweak find's behaviour using ffip-find-options
   * Smart. For keyword “helloWorld”, “HelloWorld.html”,
     “hello-world.css”, and “HelloWorld.js” are searched
