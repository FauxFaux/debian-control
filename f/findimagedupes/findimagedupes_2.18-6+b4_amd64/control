Description: Finds visually similar or duplicate images
 findimagedupes is a commandline utility which performs a rough
 "visual diff" to two images. This allows you to compare two
 images or a whole tree of images and determine if any are
 similar or identical. On common image types, findimagedupes
 seems to be around 98% accurate.
