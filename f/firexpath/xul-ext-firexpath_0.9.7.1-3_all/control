Description: extension for Firebug to edit, inspect and generate XPath expressions
 FireXPath is a Firebug extension that adds a development tool to edit,
 inspect and generate XPath expressions.
 With FireXPath you can:
  * Edit XPath expressions with auto completion (using TAB or up and down
    arrows).
  * Evaluate the expression on HTML or any XML documents.
  * Display the result of evaluations in a Firebug-like DOM tree.
  * Highlight the results directly on the document displayed by Firefox
    (works only with HTML documents).
  * Generate an XPath expression for an element by right clicking on it
    and selecting "Inspect XPath" located under "Inspect Element".
  * Define the evaluation context of an XPath expression.
  * Choose the document in which to evaluate the XPath expression (only
    applicable for HTML documents with frames or iframes).
