Description: daemon that allows remote script's execution when triggered from the network
 Fishpoll is meant to deal with a common situation. You have a data source
 (a version control repository, a database, etc). You have something built from
 that data source (a web site, say). When the data source changes, you want
 them to rebuild against the latest commits.
