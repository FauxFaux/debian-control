Description: Pluggable transport to circumvent IP address blocking - client transport plugin
 Flashproxy is a tool to circumvent censorship by setting up many, generally
 ephemeral, browser-based proxies, with the goal of outpacing a censor's
 ability to enumerate and block the IP addresses of those proxies. Censored
 clients can then connect to a Tor relay via these proxies, by using a
 hard-to-block, low-bandwidth registration system called the facilitator.
 .
 This package contains the client transport plugin that enables censored Tor
 users to circumvent censorship. It is compliant with the Tor pluggable
 transports specification.
