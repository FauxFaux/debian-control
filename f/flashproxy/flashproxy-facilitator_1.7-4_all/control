Description: Pluggable transport to circumvent IP address blocking - facilitator
 Flashproxy is a tool to circumvent censorship by setting up many, generally
 ephemeral, browser-based proxies, with the goal of outpacing a censor's
 ability to enumerate and block the IP addresses of those proxies. Censored
 clients can then connect to a Tor relay via these proxies, by using a
 hard-to-block, low-bandwidth registration system called the facilitator.
 .
 This package contains the facilitator that accepts registrations (requests
 for service) from clients, and serves them with a browser proxy that provides
 access to a Tor relay.
 .
 Most end-users do not need to install this package.
