Description: Pluggable transport to circumvent IP address blocking - nodejs proxy
 Flashproxy is a tool to circumvent censorship by setting up many, generally
 ephemeral, browser-based proxies, with the goal of outpacing a censor's
 ability to enumerate and block the IP addresses of those proxies. Censored
 clients can then connect to a Tor relay via these proxies, by using a
 hard-to-block, low-bandwidth registration system called the facilitator.
 .
 This package contains a nodejs-based proxy to be run as a local service. It
 is for people that constantly want to act as proxies for censored users.
 Due to the design of the system, it more useful when installed on a machine
 that continually changes IP address, such as a laptop.
 .
 Most end-users do not need to install this package.
