Description: Adds i18n/l10n support to Flask applications
 Flask-BabelEx adds i18n/l10n support to Flask applications with the help of
 the Babel library. It is a fork of the official Flask-Babel extension with
 the following features:
 .
  1. It is possible to use multiple language catalogs in one Flask application;
  2. Localization domains: your extension can package localization file(s) and
     use them if necessary;
  3. Does not reload localizations for each request.
 .
 Flask-BabelEx is API-compatible with Flask-Babel.
