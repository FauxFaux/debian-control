Description: Flask extension that provides bcrypt hashing utilities (doc)
 Due to the recent increased prevelance of powerful hardware,
 such as modern GPUs, hashes have become increasingly easy to crack.
 A proactive solution to this is to use a hash that was designed to be
 "de-optimized". Bcrypt is such a hashing facility; unlike hashing algorithms
 such as MD5 and SHA1, which are optimized for speed, bcrypt is intentionally
 structured to be slow.
