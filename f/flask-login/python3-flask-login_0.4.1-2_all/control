Description: user session management for Flask -- Python 3 module
 Flask-Login provides user session management for Flask. It handles the
 common tasks of logging in, logging out, and remembering your users'
 sessions over extended periods of time.
 .
 Flask-Login is not bound to any particular database system or permissions
 model. The only requirement is that your user objects implement a few
 methods, and that you provide a callback to the extension capable of
 loading users from their ID.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3 module.
