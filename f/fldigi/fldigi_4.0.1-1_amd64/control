Description: digital modem program for hamradio operators
 Fldigi is a modem program which supports most of the digital modes used
 by hamradio operators today. You can also use the program for
 calibrating your sound card to WWV or doing a frequency measurement test.
 The program also comes with a CW decoder. Fldigi is written with the
