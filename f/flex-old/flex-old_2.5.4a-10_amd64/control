Description: Old version of the fast lexical analyzer generator
 flex is a tool for generating scanners: programs which recognize lexical
 patterns in text. This is the old 2.5.4a version, which is no longer
 being developed. You should normally choose flex, unless you have
 legacy lexer files that do not work with a modern flex.
