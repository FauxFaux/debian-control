Description: Flexible backup tool for small to medium sized installations
 Flexbackup is a flexible backup tool that works well for small to medium
 sized tasks for which solutions like amanda are overkill.
 .
 It features:
  * Easy configuration
  * Uses afio, dump, GNU tar, cpio, star, pax, lha, or zip archivers
  * Full and numbered levels of incremental backup (similar to "dump")
  * Compression and buffering options for all backup types
  * Handles remote filesystems with ssh/rsh; no special services required
  * Writes to tapes, on-disk archive files, or on-disk directory trees
  * Keeps a table of contents so you know what archives are on each tape
  * Extensive logging options
