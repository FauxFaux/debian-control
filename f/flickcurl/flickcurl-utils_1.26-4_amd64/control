Description: utilities to call the Flickr API from command line
 Flickcurl is a C library for the Flickr API, handling creating the
 requests, signing, token management, calling the API, marshalling
 request parameters and decoding responses. The library now supports
 100% of the 2008-01-11 version of the API, including the functions
 for photo uploading, browsing, searching, adding and editing
 comments, groups, notes, photosets, categories, activity, blogs,
 favorites, places, tags and photo metadata. It also includes a
 program flickrdf to turn photo metadata, tags and machine tags into
 RDF descriptions of photos and tags.
 .
 Support for the Flickr API in these programs is through the
 libflickcurl library.
