Description: Free Lossless Image Format (FLIF) viewer
 FLIF is a novel lossless image format which outperforms PNG, lossless
 WebP, lossless BPG, lossless JPEG2000, and lossless JPEG XR in terms
 of compression ratio.
 .
 This package provides ‘viewflif’, a tool that displays a FLIF image
 or animation using SDL2. This is not intended to be a convenient image
 viewer; it is mostly just a simple demo application.
