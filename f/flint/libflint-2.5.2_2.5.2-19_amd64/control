Description: C library for number theory, shared library
 The Fast Library for Integer Number Theory is a C library which supports
 polynomial arithmetic over the integers, fast integer arithmetic and factoring
 (including a highly optimized quadratic sieve).
 .
 FLINT has functionality similar to that of the Number Theory Library (NTL).
 However, unlike NTL, which is designed primarily for asymptotic performance,
 FLINT is designed for good performance in small cases as well.
 .
 This package contains the FLINT shared library.
