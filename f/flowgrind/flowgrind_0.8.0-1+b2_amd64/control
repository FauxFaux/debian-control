Description: Distributed network performance measurement tool
 Flowgrind is a TCP performance measurement tool similar to iperf
 and netperf to measure throughput and other metrics for TCP.
 In Flowgrind's distributed architecture, the flowgrind controller
 is used to schedule flows between and collect live samples from
 nodes running the flowgrindd daemon.
 .
 Features:
  * Measure bandwidth, delay, and IAT and sample TCP kernel metrics (tcp_info)
  * Bulk transfers, rate-limited flows, sophisticated request/response test
  * Report observed MSS/MTU size
  * Set buffer size on per flow basis
  * Set congestion control algorithm, DSCP field, etc.
  * Uses asynchronous I/O to improve fairness between flows
  * Gnuplot compatible configureable output format
