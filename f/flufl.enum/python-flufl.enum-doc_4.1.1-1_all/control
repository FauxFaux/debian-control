Description: yet another Python enumeration package (common documentation)
 This package provides a Python enumeration, with an emphasis on simple,
 specific, concise semantics in an easy to read and write syntax.
 ``flufl.enum`` has just enough of the features needed to make enumerations
 useful, but without a lot of extra baggage to weigh them down.
 .
 This is the common documentation package.
