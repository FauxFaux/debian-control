Description: high level API for Python internationalization (common documentation)
 This package provides a high level, convenient API for managing
 internationalization translation contexts in Python application.  There is a
 simple API for single-context applications, such as command line scripts which
 only need to translate into one language during the entire course of their
 execution.  There is a more flexible, but still convenient API for
 multi-context applications, such as servers, which may need to switch language
 contexts for different tasks.
 .
 This is the common documentation package.
