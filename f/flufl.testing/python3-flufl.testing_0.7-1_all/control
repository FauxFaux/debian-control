Description: small collection of Python test helpers
 This package includes plugins for the following test tools: nose2, flake8.
 The plugins provide useful features (e.g. filtering tests based on a regular
 expression) and ensure some common coding styles (e.g. import order).  They
 can be enabled independently.
 .
 This package refactors code in the test suites of several other packages and
 will be used to eliminate the usual skew due to cargo culting.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version of the package.
