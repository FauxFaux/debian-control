Description: Find Maximum Common Substructure
 Fcms finds the maximum common substructure (MCS) of a group (or cluster) of
 chemical structures and report the result as a SMARTS string.
 .
 More specifically, the MCS found is a common edge subgraph, and not a
 common induced subgraph. Only connected MCSes are found.
