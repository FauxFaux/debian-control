Description: folding-editor minor mode for Emacs
 This package provides an Emacs minor mode for folding (hiding) custom
 regions.  It also provides an Isearch interface to the folds.  Folds
 can be nested hierarchically.
 .
 Folding-mode is similar to a general-purpose Outline-mode or to
 Org-mode.  It can CLOSE a fold so that only initial special marker
 and optional fold name/comment are visible, or it can ENTER a fold so
 that all text outside of the target fold is hidden.
 .
 The upstream maintainers of folding-mode do not recommend exclusively
 relying on folding-mode for code layout and navigation.  Hideshow and
 Imenu are more appropriate for folding code at a per-function() level
 of granularity.  In particular Imenu is more useful for this because
 it parses function indexes.  Folding mode is most useful for dividing
 code into broad operations and for organising stubs while prototyping.
