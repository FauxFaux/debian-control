Description: Xerox-compatible finite-state compiler - library
 Foma can be used for constructing finite-state automata and transducers.
 It has support for many natural language processing applications such as
 producing morphological analyzers. It is sufficiently generic to use for
 a large number of purposes in addition to NLP. The foma interface is
 similar to the Xerox xfst interface
 .
 This package includes binaries for foma.
