Description: Font Awesome perfectly integrated into JavaFX
 This package allows Java developers to easily integrate different icon fonts
 like Font Awesome, WeatherIcons, MaterialStackIcons, Material Design Font,
 Octicons and 525Icons into their JavaFX applications. This is possible because
 all icons are scalable vector graphics and each icon can be styled with CSS.
