Description: Signage font
 This is an open source typeface designed for use in signage. Allerta was
 designed to be easily and quickly read from a distance. Each letter exploits
 the most unique aspects of that individual letter so that each character can
 be easily distinguished from any other.
 .
 The name Allerta is derived from the origins of the word alert (adj. swift,
 v. to advise or warn). The Italian origin all'erta literally means on the
 lookout.
