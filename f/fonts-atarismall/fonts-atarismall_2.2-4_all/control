Description: Very small 4 x 8 font
 This is named atari small because it was designed for a terminal emulator
 written for an Atari 800. It only had a 320 pixel wide display, but an 80
 column terminal was wanted, hence there is this font. This is somewhat
 cleaned up from the original version. It has only a one pixel descent to
 maximize pixels available to the main body of each character.
