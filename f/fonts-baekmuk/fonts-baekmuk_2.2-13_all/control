Description: Baekmuk series Korean fonts
 This is a set of Korean TrueType fonts, which contains 4 font
 families; Dotum, Batang, Gulim and Headline.
 .
 Note that these fonts are not recommended for computer display.
 Because they are not with reasonable hinting instructions, their CJK
 glyphs (which usually have more strokes than Latin glyphs) are almost
 not readable in most computer screens.
