Description: Vera font family derivate with additional characters (extra variants)
 DejaVu provides an expanded version of the Vera font family aiming for
 quality and broader Unicode coverage while retaining the original Vera
 style. DejaVu currently works towards conformance with the Multilingual
 European Standards (MES-1 and MES-2) for Unicode coverage. The DejaVu
 fonts provide serif, sans and monospaced variants.
 .
 This package includes additional variants, such as oblique, italic,
 bold-oblique, bold-italic and the condensed forms.
 .
 DejaVu fonts are intended for use on low-resolution devices (mainly
 computer screens) but can be used in printing as well.
