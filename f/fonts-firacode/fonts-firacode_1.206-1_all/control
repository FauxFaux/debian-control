Description: Monospaced font with programming ligatures
 Fira Code is an extension of the Fira Mono font containing a set of
 ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations. This is
 just a font rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible.
 This helps to read and understand code faster. For some frequent sequences
 like .. or //, the ligatures allow one to correct spacing.
 .
 This font is expected to work in most text editors but won't work in most
 (especially VTE-based) terminal emulators. A detailed list is available on
