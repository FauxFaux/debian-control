Description: Old style roman font
 Based on the roman of Frederic Goudy's Kennerley Old Style (designed and cut
 in 1911 for a limited edition of "The Door in the Wall and Other Stories" by
 H G Wells, published by Mitchell Kennerley). The companion italic is a
 future project.
 .
 The letters, though not condensed, may seem to fit together like pieces of a
 jigsaw puzzle, giving text an unusually solid appearance.
