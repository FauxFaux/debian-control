Description: Japanese OpenType font, all IPAex Fonts
 IPAex Fonts are JIS X 0213:2004 compliant OpenType fonts based on TrueType
 outlines provided by Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan
 (IPA) from 2010.  The older JIS X 0213:2000 font gliphs are also
 supported via IVS (Ideographic Variation Sequence).  These are suitable
 for both display and printing.
 .
 These new fonts are developed from IPA Fonts to provide the best balance
 for the Japanese documentation mixed with Western characters by following
 Japanese printing tradition.  Japanese characters (Kanji, Kana and
 punctuation marks) are full width mono-space pitch, and Western characters
 are proportional pitch.
 .
 This metapackage depends on fonts-ipaexfont-{mincho,gothic} packages to
 provide IPAex Mincho and IPAex Gothic Fonts.
