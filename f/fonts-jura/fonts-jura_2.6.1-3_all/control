Description: monospaced, sans-serif font
 This font remembers of a typewrite font without the serifs. The latin letters
 assume pretty much of a "Swiss" feel, so the font was named after the Jura
 region on the border between France and Switzerland.
 .
 Almost all of the Latin-1 range is represented (omitting only superscript
 numerals, fractions, and the pilcrow).
