Description: Bold, modern, geometric sans-serif font
 Taking a strong influence from ATF's classic Spartan family, the leageue of
 movable type started their own family out with a single strong weight. They've
 put a few unique touches into a beautiful, historical typeface, and made sure
 to include an extensive characterset - currently totaling over 300 glyphs.
