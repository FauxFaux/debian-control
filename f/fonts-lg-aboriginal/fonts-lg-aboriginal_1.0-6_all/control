Description: unicode fonts for North-American Aboriginal languages
 This package contains fonts that can be used to read and write in many
 North-American Aboriginal Languages, too often neglected by the world at large.
 .
 It is hoped that the availability of quality open fonts can help these
 languages prosper far into the future.
 .
 The Aboriginal font family includes support for Syllabics (Cree, Ojibway,
 Naskapi, Inuktitut, Dakelh, Blackfoot, Dene), Cherokee and Roman Orthographies
 (Secwepemctsin, Statlimx, Siouan).
