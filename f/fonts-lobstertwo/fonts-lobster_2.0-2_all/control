Description: bold condensed script with many ligatures and alternates
 The beauty of real hand-drawn lettering is that the lettering artists subtly
 modify the shape of letters so they connect with the next ones. These linked
 letters-pairs are called "ligatures". Thus, in order to provide a smooth
 hand-written look, the Lobster font provides a large number of ligatures,
 as well as terminal forms (i.e. glyphs that are used for word endings).
