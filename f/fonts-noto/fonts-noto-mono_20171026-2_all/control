Description: "No Tofu" monospaced font family with large Unicode coverage
 Noto is a collection of font families, each visually harmonized across
 scripts.
 .
 This package contains Noto Mono font family, formerly known as Droid
 Mono.  Beware that Noto Mono has a much smaller repertoire than Noto
 Sans or Noto Serif.
 .
 The name "Noto" is short for "No Tofu", describing the aim of covering
 all living Unicode scripts.
 .
 Tofu (豆腐) is Japanese jargon for unicode replacement character "�"
 (U+FFFD) often displayed as replacement for unassigned or unknown
 characters.
