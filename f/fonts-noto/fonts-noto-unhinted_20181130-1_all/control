Description: "No Tofu" font families with large Unicode coverage (unhinted)
 Noto is a collection of font families,
 each visually harmonized across scripts.
 .
 This package contains Noto font families which lacks hinting:
 .
  * Noto Sans Khojki
 .
 The name "Noto" is short for "No Tofu",
 describing the aim of covering all living Unicode scripts
 (currently 66 are covered, at least partly,
 across hinted and unhinted packages).
 .
 Tofu (豆腐) is Japanese jargon
 for unicode replacement character "�" (U+FFFD)
 often displayed as replacement for unassigned or unknown characters.
