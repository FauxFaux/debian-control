Description: metapackage to pull in all Noto fonts
 Noto is a collection of font families, each visually harmonized across
 scripts.
 .
 Use this package if you want all Noto fonts.
 .
 The name "Noto" is short for "No Tofu", describing the aim of covering
 all living Unicode scripts
 (currently 47 are covered, at least partly, across
 hinted and unhinted).
 .
 Tofu (豆腐) is Japanese jargon for unicode replacement character "�"
 (U+FFFD) often displayed as replacement for unassigned or unknown
 characters.
