Description: metapackage to pull in all Noto fonts
 Noto is a collection of font families,
 each visually harmonized across scripts.
 .
 Use this package if you want all Noto fonts.
 .
 The name "Noto" is short for "No Tofu",
 describing the aim of covering all living Unicode scripts
 (currently 66 are covered, at least partly,
 across hinted and unhinted).
 .
 Tofu (豆腐) is Japanese jargon
 for unicode replacement character "�" (U+FFFD)
 often displayed as replacement for unassigned or unknown characters.
