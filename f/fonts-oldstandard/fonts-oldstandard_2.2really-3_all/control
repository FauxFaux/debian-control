Description: smart font with wide range of Latin, Greek and Cyrillic characters
 The Old Standard font family is an attempt to revive a specific type of
 modern (classicistic) antiqua, very commonly used in various editions
 printed in the late 19th and early 20th century, but almost completely
 abandoned later.

 The full font sources (fontforge .sfd and xgridfit .xdf) and
