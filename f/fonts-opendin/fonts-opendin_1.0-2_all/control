Description: Open DIN font
 The idea of this open typeface is being the most close as possible from the
 Prussian Railways master drawing (public domain license, afaik), and its
 applications.
 .
 This typeface were made using open-source tools, like Fontforge and Inkscape,
 also for helping their development from using them.
