Description: minimalistic sans serif typeface
 Play is a minimalistic sans serif typeface designed by Jonas Hecksher, Type
 Director of Playtype™ Type Foundry. All letters in Play derive from the 'O' –
 square and circular at the same time. Play is designed with large, open
 counters, ample lowercase x-heights and a corporate, yet friendly appearance.
 The combination of these qualities give Play both a high legibility and
 readability.
