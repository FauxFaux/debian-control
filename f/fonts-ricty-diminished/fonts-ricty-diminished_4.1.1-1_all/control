Description: font based on Inconsolata and Circle M+ 1m for programming
 Ricty Diminished is a font based on Inconsolata and Circle M+ 1m,
 optimized for the programming usage.
 .
  - Use Inconsolata for the Latin character glyphs and "Circle M+ 1m" font for
    other glyphs.
  - Adjust the width of full-width and normal-width character glyphs to
    2:1 ratio exactly full and half.
  - Design the comma, period, colon, semicolon and bracket character glyphs
    to differentiate each other clearly to prevent confusions.
  - Design the high visibility p-sound sign attached Kana character glyphs.
  - Design the En-dash and Em-dash glyphs show them as the broken line to
    prevent input failures for LaTeX.
  - It shows Em-size space as "box" character because Em-size space often.
    prevents debugging since users usually miss it. With Ricty Diminished font,
    users can find and fix it easily.
