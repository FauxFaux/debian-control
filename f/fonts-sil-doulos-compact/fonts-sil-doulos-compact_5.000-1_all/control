Description: smart Unicode font for Latin and Cyrillic scripts (tight spacing version)
 The goal for the Doulos SIL font is to provide a single Unicode-based font
 family that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for
 almost any Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for
 phonetic or orthographic needs. In addition, there is provision for other
 characters and symbols useful to linguists.
 .
 The Doulos SIL font contains near-complete coverage of all the characters
 defined in Unicode 7.0 for Latin and Cyrillic. In total, over 3,600 glyphs are
 included, providing support for over 2,300 characters as well as a large number
 of ligated character sequences (e.g., contour tone letters used in phonetic
 transcription of tonal languages).
 .
 In addition, alternately-designed glyphs are also provided for a number of
 characters for use in particular contexts. The glyphs are accessible in
 applications that support advanced font technologies, specifically the Graphite
 or OpenType technologies. These technologies are also utilized to provide
 automatic positioning of diacritics relative to base characters in arbitrary
 base+diacritic combinations (including combinations involving multiple
 diacritics).
 .
 Doulos SIL is a TrueType font with "smart font" capabilities added using the
 Graphite, OpenType(r), and AAT font technologies. This means that complex
 typographic issues such as formation of ligatures or automatic positioning of
 diacritics relative to base characters in arbitrary base+diacritic combinations
 (including combinations involving multiple diacritics) are handled by the font.
 In addition, alternately-designed glyphs are also provided for a number of
 characters for use in particular contexts. These capabilities are only
 available if you are running an application that provides an adequate level of
 support for one of these smart font technologies.
 .
 This is the compact version with tighter line spacing.
