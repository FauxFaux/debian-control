Description: font family for Latin-1 and Greek (polytonic support)
 The Galatia SIL Greek Unicode Fonts are a new version of the SIL Galatia font
 released by SIL in 1997.
 .
 The Latin-1 codepage ("A-Z", "a-z" plus some punctuation, etc.) is included in
 the font. This is to assist with viewing Latin or Roman text. The Macintosh
 character set for US Roman and the 850 WE/Latin-1 encodings are also included.
 .
 Polytonic Greek is supported but Coptic is not. There is no automatic formation
 of the final sigma.
