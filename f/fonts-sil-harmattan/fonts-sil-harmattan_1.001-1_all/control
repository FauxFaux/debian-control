Description: Arabic script font for West African languages
 Harmattan, named after the trade winds that blow during the winter in West
 Africa, is designed in a Warsh style to suit the needs of languages using
 the Arabic script in West Africa.
 .
 Harmattan does not cover the full Unicode Arabic repertoire. It only supports
 characters known to be used by languages in West Africa.
 .
 Harmattan makes use of state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex
 typographic issues. Font smarts are implemented using OpenType and Graphite
 technologies.
 .
 Harmattan provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic
 connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures
 or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This
 simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic
 languages, but may be considered unattractive in more traditional and
 literate communities.
 .
 Webfont versions and HTML/CSS examples are also available.
 .

 An open workflow is used for building, testing and releasing.
