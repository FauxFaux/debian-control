Description: Thai TlwgTypo TrueType font
 This package provides Thai TlwgTypo monospace font from TLWG, in TrueType
 format.
 .
 The font provides Thai purely monospace font, i.e. all glyphs are of the
 same width, even for combining characters, but with some rules in the font
 to combine them to base characters.
 .
 The glyph shapes are designed to look like Thai electric typewriters.
