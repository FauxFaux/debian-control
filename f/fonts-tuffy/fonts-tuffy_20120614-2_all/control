Description: The Tuffy Truetype Font Family
 Thatcher Ulrich's first outline font design. He started with the goal of
 producing a neutral, readable sans-serif text font. There are lots of
 "expressive" fonts out there, but he wanted to start with something very plain
 and clean, something he might want to actually use.
