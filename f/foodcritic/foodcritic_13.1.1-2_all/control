Description: lint tool for chef cookbooks
 Foodcritic has two goals:
 .
 To make it easier to flag problems in your Chef cookbooks that will cause Chef
 to blow up when you attempt to converge. This is about faster feedback. If you
 automate checks for common problems you can save a lot of time.
 .
 To encourage discussion within the Chef community on the more subjective stuff
 - what does a good cookbook look like? Opscode have avoided being overly
 prescriptive. Having a set of rules to base discussion on helps drive out what
 the community think is good style.
