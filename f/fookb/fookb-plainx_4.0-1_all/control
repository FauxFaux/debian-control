Description: Xkb state indicator -- plain X version (transitional package)
 WindowMaker docked Xkb state indicator. Fookb can switch xkb groups
 and display a pixmap corresponding to the selected group. It also can
 execute a specified command upon the switch (for example, play sound).
 This is the plain X-compiled version. It can't do docking, and uses
 only X resources for configuration.
 .
 This is a transitional package. It can safely be removed.
