Description: OpenPrinting printer support - programs
 Foomatic is a printing system designed to make it easier to set up
 common printers for use with Debian (and other operating systems).
 It provides the "glue" between a print spooler (like CUPS or lpr) and
 your actual printer, by telling your computer how to process files
 sent to the printer.
 .
 This package contains the architecture-dependent programs needed to
 set up and maintain the foomatic system.  You will also need one or
 more database packages.  The foomatic-db package includes drivers for
 most common printers using Ghostscript as the print processor, as
 well as some common glue code used in other filter systems.
