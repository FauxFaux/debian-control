Description: OpenPrinting printer support - database
 Foomatic is a printing system designed to make it easier to set up
 common printers for use with Debian (and other operating systems).
 It provides the "glue" between a print spooler (like CUPS or lpr) and
 your actual printer, by telling your computer how to process files
 sent to the printer.
 .
 This package contains the printer database distributed by
 OpenPrinting for most common drivers.  You will probably need
 the foomatic-db-engine package for this package to be useful.
