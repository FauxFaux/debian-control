Description: OpenPrinting printer support - PostScript PPD files
 This package includes a collection of free PostScript Printer Description
 files for PostScript (and clone) printers from various manufacturers, as
 distributed by OpenPrinting.
 .
 If you have non-PostScript printers, the foomatic-db-compressed-ppds (or
 foomatic-db and foomatic-db-engine), hplip and the
 printer-driver-* packages are the ones you need; this package
 won't be of much help to you.
 .
 Some manufacturers distribute PPD files for their printers under
 non-free licenses; those are not included in this package, but may be
 available from the manufacturer's website, included on a CD or
 other media with the printer, or downloadable from the OpenPrinting
 web site (even automatically if the printer setup tool supports it).
