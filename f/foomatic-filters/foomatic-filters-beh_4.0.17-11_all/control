Description: Openprinting Backend error handler
 Foomatic is a printer database designed to make it easier to set up
 common printers for use with UNIX-like operating systems.
 It provides the "glue" between a print spooler (like CUPS or lpr) and
 the printer, by processing files sent to the printer.
 .
 This package contains the backend error handler.
