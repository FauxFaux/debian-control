Description: OpenPrinting printer support - filters
 Foomatic is a printer database designed to make it easier to set up
 common printers for use with UNIX-like operating systems.
 It provides the "glue" between a print spooler (like CUPS or lpr) and
 the printer, by processing files sent to the printer.
 .
 This package consists of filters used by the printer spoolers
 to convert the incoming PostScript data into the printer's native
 format using a printer-specific, but spooler-independent PPD file.
 .
 For use with CUPS, you will need both the cups and cups-client
 packages installed on your system.
