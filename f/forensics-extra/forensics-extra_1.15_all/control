Description: Forensics Environment - extra console components (metapackage)
 This package provides the extra components for a forensics environment. All
 here available tools are text console based. None of these tools were packaged
 by Debian Forensics Team. This metapackage includes the most programs to data
 recovery, rootkit and exploit search, filesystems and memory analysis, image
 acquisition, volume inspection, passwords crackers, dictionaries (all put in
 /usr/share/dict), disassemblers, special actions over the hardware and many
 other activities.
 .
 The idea is provide several packages via APT, to avoid forgetting something
 when creating a specialized environment, specifically designed to operate
 outdoor.
 .
 There are not an intent to provide tools for remote attacks. So, packages as
 aircrack-ng can be provided to allow a local analyses over pcap files. The
 hydra and nmap packages can be used to find vulnerabilities inside a LAN which
 is being investigated.
 .
 Other examples are hexedit and mc packages. mc provides mcview. The hexedit
 and mcview are able to manipulate very large files.
 .
 The following packages were included in this metapackage:
