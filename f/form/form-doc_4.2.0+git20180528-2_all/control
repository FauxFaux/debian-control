Description: Documentation for symbolic manipulation system
 This is the documentation for the Symbolic Manipulation System. It reads
 symbolic expressions from files and executes symbolic/algebraic
 transformations upon them. The answers are returned in a textual
 mathematical representation. As its landmark feature, the size of the
 considered expressions in FORM is only limited by the available disk
 space and not by the available RAM.
