Description: Symbolic manipulation system
 This is a Symbolic Manipulation System. It reads symbolic expressions from
 files and executes symbolic/algebraic transformations upon them. The answers
 are returned in a textual mathematical representation. As its landmark
 feature, the size of the considered expressions in FORM is only limited by
 the available disk space and not by the available RAM.
