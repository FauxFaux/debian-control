Description: API for the Smaky file system
 Fosfat is a C library for providing read-only access to a Smaky
 formatted disk. Currently, only a tool and a FUSE extension that
 use this library can be used for reading a directory and copying
 a file.
 .
 The Smaky is a line of mostly 8-bit personal computers and
 accompanying operating system developed at the EPFL (Ã‰cole
 Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne), in Switzerland, from 1974.
 .
 This package contains the libfosfat0, which provides the API for the
 Smaky file system.
