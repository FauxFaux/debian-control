Description: advanced proxy management tool for Firefox and Thunderbird
 FoxyProxy is a proxy management tool that completely replaces the proxy
 configuration options in Firefox and Thunderbird, and compliments it with
 the ability to:
  - define multiple proxies and order their use with priorities
  - temporarily or permanently disable a proxy with the click of a
    button
  - define which proxy to use (or none!) for arbitrary URLs using
    wildcards, regular expression and other conveniences
  - log of all URLs loaded, including which proxy was used (if any),
    and which pattern was matched, timestamps, etc.
  - enable optional status bar information about which proxy is
    currently in use
  - support Tor
  - support full Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) and WPAD
  - support pattern subscriptions
  - import proxy lists
