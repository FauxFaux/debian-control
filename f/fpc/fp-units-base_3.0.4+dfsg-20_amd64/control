Description: Free Pascal - base units dependency package
 The Free Pascal Compiler is an Object Pascal compiler supporting both Delphi
 and Turbo Pascal 7.0 dialects, as well as Mac Pascal dialects. It provides a
 completely portable RunTime Library (RTL) available on many platforms and
 compatible with Turbo Pascal, along with a platform-independent class-based
 Free Component Library (FCL) adding many Delphi extensions and interfacing
 with many popular open source libraries.
 .
 This dependency package always depends on the latest available version of
 the package containing Free Pascal units for common libraries (some of which
 are also required by the Free Component Library): NCurses, X11 (Xlib,
 Xutil), and ZLib.
