Description: Free Pascal - math units
 The Free Pascal Compiler is an Object Pascal compiler supporting both Delphi
 and Turbo Pascal 7.0 dialects, as well as Mac Pascal dialects. It provides a
 completely portable RunTime Library (RTL) available on many platforms and
 compatible with Turbo Pascal, along with a platform-independent class-based
 Free Component Library (FCL) adding many Delphi extensions and interfacing
 with many popular open source libraries.
 .
 This package contains Free Pascal math interfacing units for:
  * gmp (the GNU Multiple Precision arithmetic library);
  * numlib (numerical computing);
  * proj4 (cartographic projections);
  * symbolic (symbolic computing).
