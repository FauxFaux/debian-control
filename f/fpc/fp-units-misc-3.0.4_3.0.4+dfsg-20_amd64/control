Description: Free Pascal - miscellaneous units
 The Free Pascal Compiler is an Object Pascal compiler supporting both Delphi
 and Turbo Pascal 7.0 dialects, as well as Mac Pascal dialects. It provides a
 completely portable RunTime Library (RTL) available on many platforms and
 compatible with Turbo Pascal, along with a platform-independent class-based
 Free Component Library (FCL) adding many Delphi extensions and interfacing
 with many popular open source libraries.
 .
 This package contains miscellaneous Free Pascal units: fppkg (the FPC
 packaging system), PasZLib (a Pascal-only zlib implementation), and Utmp.
