Description: Free Pascal - networking units
 The Free Pascal Compiler is an Object Pascal compiler supporting both Delphi
 and Turbo Pascal 7.0 dialects, as well as Mac Pascal dialects. It provides a
 completely portable RunTime Library (RTL) available on many platforms and
 compatible with Turbo Pascal, along with a platform-independent class-based
 Free Component Library (FCL) adding many Delphi extensions and interfacing
 with many popular open source libraries.
 .
 This package contains Free Pascal units for creating network tools: D-Bus,
 httpd-1.3, httpd-2.0, httpd-2.2, ldap, libasync, libcurl, netdb, openssl,
 and pcap.
