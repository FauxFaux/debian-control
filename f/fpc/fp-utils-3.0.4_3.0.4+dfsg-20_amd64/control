Description: Free Pascal - utilities
 The Free Pascal Compiler is an Object Pascal compiler supporting both Delphi
 and Turbo Pascal 7.0 dialects, as well as Mac Pascal dialects. It provides a
 completely portable RunTime Library (RTL) available on many platforms and
 compatible with Turbo Pascal, along with a platform-independent class-based
 Free Component Library (FCL) adding many Delphi extensions and interfacing
 with many popular open source libraries.
 .
 This package contains some handy utilities for use with the Free Pascal
 Compiler:
  * data2inc   convert binary/text data to include files;
  * fpcmake    create Makefile from Makefile.fpc;
  * h2pas      convert .h files to Pascal units;
  * plex/pyacc Pascal Lex and Yacc implementations;
  * ppdep      create a dependency file for use with Makefiles;
  * ppudump    dump the information stored in a .ppu (unit) file;
  * ppufiles   show needed files for units;
  * ppumove    place multiple units in a shared library;
  * ptop       beautify source.
