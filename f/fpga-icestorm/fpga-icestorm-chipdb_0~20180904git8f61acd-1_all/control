Description: Chip database files for fpga-icestorm
 Project IceStorm aims at documenting the bitstream format of Lattice iCE40
 FPGAs and providing simple tools for analyzing and creating bitstream files. At
 the moment the focus of the project is on the HX1K-TQ144 and HX8K-CT256
 devices, but most of the information is device-independent.
 .
 This package contains the chip database files for fpga-icestorm.
