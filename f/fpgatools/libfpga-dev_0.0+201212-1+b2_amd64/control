Description: development files for fpgatools
 fpgatools is a toolchain to program field-programmable gate arrays
 (FPGA).  The only supported chip at this time is the xc6slx9, a cheap
 but powerful 45nm-generation chip with about 2400 LUTs, block ram and
 multiply-accumulate devices.
 .
 This package contains headers and libraries for developing bits file
 that makes use of libfpga.
