Description: libraries of fpgatools
 fpgatools is a toolchain to program field-programmable gate arrays
 (FPGA).  The only supported chip at this time is the xc6slx9, a cheap
 but powerful 45nm-generation chip with about 2400 LUTs, block ram and
 multiply-accumulate devices.
 .
 This package provides a shared library for small independent
 command line utilities contributing to the fpgatools.
  * plain C, no C++
  * simple Makefiles
  * text-based file formats
  * automatic test suite
