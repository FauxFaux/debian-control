Description: sends ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts
 fping is a ping like program which uses the Internet Control Message Protocol
 (ICMP) echo request to determine if a target host is responding.  fping
 differs from ping in that you can specify any number of targets on the command
 line, or specify a file containing the lists of targets to ping.  Instead of
 sending to one target until it times out or replies, fping will send out a
 ping packet and move on to the next target in a round-robin fashion.
