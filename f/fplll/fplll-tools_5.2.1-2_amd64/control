Description: Tools to compute LLL-reduction of Euclidian lattices
 fpLLL is a library for computing reduced (nearly orthogonal) bases
 for Euclidean lattices using the floating-point LLL algorithm.
 .
 fpLLL contains multiple different implementations of the
 floating-point LLL reduction algorithm, offering multiple different
 speed/guarantees ratios.
 .
 It contains a 'wrapper' that chooses the estimated best sequence of
 variants in order to provide a guaranteed output as fast as possible.
 In the case of the wrapper, the succession of variants is oblivious
 to the user.
 .
 This package contains the base tools using libfplll.
