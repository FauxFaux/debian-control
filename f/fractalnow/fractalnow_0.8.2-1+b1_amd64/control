Description: Fast, advanced fractal generator
 FractalNow provides users with tools to generate pictures of various types of
 fractals quickly and easily.
 .
 It is made of both a command line (FractalNow) and a graphical tool
 (QFractalNow).
 .
 The graphical tool, based on Qt library, allows users to explore fractals
 intuitively and generate pictures.
 .
 Both tools are entirely multi-threaded and implement advanced algorithms and
 heuristics that make computation very fast compared to most existing free
 fractal generators.
