Description: Platform dedicated to the analysis of source code written in C (without gui)
 Frama-C gathers several analysis techniques in a single collaborative
 framework, based on analyzers (called "plug-ins") that can build upon the
 results computed by other analyzers in the framework.
 .
 Thanks to this approach, Frama-C provides sophisticated tools, including:
   * an analyzer based on abstract interpretation (Value plug-in);
   * a program proof framework based on weakest precondition calculus (WP plug-in);
   * a program slicer (Slicing plug-in);
   * a tool for verification of temporal (LTL) properties (Aora√Ø plug-in);
   * several tools for code base exploration and dependency analysis
     (plug-ins From, Impact, Metrics, Occurrence, Scope, etc.).
  .
 These plug-ins communicate between each other via the Frama-C API
 and via ACSL (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language) properties.
 .
 This package provides the library of Frama-c which is useful to build
 plugins for Frama-c and the command-line tools.
