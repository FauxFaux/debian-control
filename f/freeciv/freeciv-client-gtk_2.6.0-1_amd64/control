Description: Civilization turn based strategy game (GTK+ client)
 Freeciv is a free clone of the turn based strategy game Civilization.
 In this game, each player becomes leader of a civilisation, fighting to
 obtain the ultimate goal: the extinction of all other civilisations.
 .
 This is the GTK 2 version of Freeciv. It is recommended to install the
 »freeciv-client-gtk3« package and to use the GTK 3 client unless you really
 want to try this one.
