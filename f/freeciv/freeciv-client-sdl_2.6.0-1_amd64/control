Description: Civilization turn based strategy game (SDL client)
 Freeciv is a free clone of the turn based strategy game Civilization.
 In this game, each player becomes leader of a civilisation, fighting to
 obtain the ultimate goal: the extinction of all other civilisations.
 .
 This version of Freeciv is based on SDL, the Simple DirectMedia Layer library.
 It is recommended to install the »freeciv-client-gtk3« package and to use the
 GTK 3 client unless you really want to try this one. The SDL client offers a
 different look&feel but lacks some functionality of the GTK 3 client.
