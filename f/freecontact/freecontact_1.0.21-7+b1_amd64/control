Description: fast protein contact predictor
 FreeContact is a protein residue contact predictor optimized for speed.
 Its input is a multiple sequence alignment. FreeContact can function as an
 accelerated drop-in for the published contact predictors
 EVfold-mfDCA of DS. Marks (2011) and
 PSICOV of D. Jones (2011).
 .
 FreeContact is accelerated by a combination of vector instructions, multiple
 threads, and faster implementation of key parts.
 Depending on the alignment, 8-fold or higher speedups are possible.
 .
 A sufficiently large alignment is required for meaningful results.
 As a minimum, an alignment with an effective (after-weighting) sequence count
 bigger than the length of the query sequence should be used. Alignments with
 tens of thousands of (effective) sequences are considered good input.
 .
 jackhmmer(1) from the hmmer package, or hhblits(1) from hhsuite
 can be used to generate the alignments, for example.
 .
 This package contains the command line tool freecontact(1).
