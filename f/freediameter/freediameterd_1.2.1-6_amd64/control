Description: Daemon for the Diameter protocol
 Diameter is a protocol designed to carry Authentication, Authorization and
 Accounting (AAA) payload. It is an evolution of the RADIUS protocol (as the
 name suggests).
 .
 freeDiameter is an implementation of the Diameter protocol.
 .
 This simple daemon parses the command line and initializes the freeDiameter
 framework. Use it for your Diameter server & agent components.  In case of
 Diameter clients, you probably will prefer linking the libfdcore directly with
 your client application that must be made Diameter-aware.
