Description: adventure and role-playing game (game data)
 Dink Smallwood is an adventure/role-playing game, similar to Zelda,
 made by RTsoft. Besides twisted humour, it includes the actual game
 editor, allowing players to create hundreds of new adventures called
 Dink Modules or D-Mods for short.
 .
 This package contains architecture-independent data for the original
 game, along with free sound and music replacements.
