Description: humorous top-down adventure and role-playing game (engine)
 Dink Smallwood is an adventure/role-playing game, similar to Zelda,
 made by RTsoft. Besides twisted humor, it includes the actual game
 editor, allowing players to create hundreds of new adventures called
 Dink Modules or D-Mods for short.
 .
 GNU FreeDink is a new and portable version of the game engine, which
 runs the original game as well as its D-Mods, with close
 compatibility, under multiple platforms.
 .
 This package contains the game engine alone.
