Description: multiplayer deathmatch game for Doom-compatible engines
 The Freedoom project aims to produce three base-game data files
 (IWADs) for Doom-compatible engines.  With it comes the
 capability to also play the wide range of mods created for Doom
 by a vibrant community.
 .
 FreeDM is a fast-paced set of levels designed for multiplayer
 deathmatches, part of the Freedoom project.  Challenge your
 friends to the most torturous test of their abilities as you
 navigate through 32 levels stalking and hunting them.
 .
 FreeDM is fully compatible with Doom II mods.
