Description: Free patch set for MIDI audio synthesis
 Freepats is a free patch set suitable for MIDI audio synthesis.  It is not
 complete, nor comprehensive yet, and most, if not all patches are in the
 old and limited GUS patch format.
 .
 It is, however, the sole DFSG-compliant patch set in existence so far.
 New patches (including those in better formats, such as SF2 SoundFont banks)
 are welcome.
