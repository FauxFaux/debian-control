Description: speech synthesis system
 FreeTTS is a speech synthesis system written entirely in the Java(TM)
 programming language.  It is based upon Flite, a small run-time speech
 synthesis engine developed at Carnegie Mellon University.  Flite in turn
 is derived from the Festival Speech Synthesis System from the University
 of Edinburgh and the FestVox project from Carnegie Mellon University.
