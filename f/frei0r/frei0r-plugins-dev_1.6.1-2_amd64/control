Description: minimalistic plugin API for video effects, header files
 frei0r is a minimalistic plugin API for video sources and filters. The
 behavior of the effects can be controlled from the host by simple
 parameters. The intent is to solve the recurring reimplementation or
 adaptation issue of standard effects. It is not meant as a generic API
 for all kinds of video applications.
 .
 frei0r plugins are used by several projects (e.g.: LiVES, Veejay, Open
 Movie Editor, FreeJ, Pure Data Visual Junk Tools, MLT framework).
 .
 This package contains the header needed to enable frei0r in other
 package at build time.
