Description: Text mode interpreter for TADS version 2 and 3 game files
 TADS is the Text Adventure Development System, a set of tools for writing
 and playing text-based adventure games.  You interface with these games by
 entering commands in English, and the game responds with a textual
 description of the result.
 .
 This package contains the text-mode TADS 2 and TADS 3 interpreter.  You
 must have a TADS interpreter to play a TADS game file, which typically has
 an extension of ".gam" or ".t3".  You can find many of these games at the
 Interactive Fiction Archive at http://www.ifarchive.org/.
