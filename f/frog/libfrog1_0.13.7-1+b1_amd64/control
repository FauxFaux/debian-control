Description: tagger and parser for Dutch language (library)
 Memory-Based Learning (MBL) is a machine-learning method applicable to a wide
 range of tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
 .
 Frog is a modular system integrating a morphosyntactic tagger, lemmatizer,
 morphological analyzer, and dependency parser for natural languages.  Using
 Memory-Based Learning techniques, Frog analyses word tokens in incoming
 UTF-8 text files, and assigns a dependency graph to each sentence.
 .
 Frog is a product of the ILK Research Group (Tilburg University,
 The Netherlands) and the CLiPS Research Centre (University of Antwerp,
 Belgium).
 .
 This package provides the runtime files required to run programs that use
 Frog.
