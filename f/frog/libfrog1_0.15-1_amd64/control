Description: tagger and parser for Dutch language (library)
 Memory-Based Learning (MBL) is a machine-learning method applicable to a wide
 range of tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
 .
 Frog is a modular system integrating a morphosyntactic tagger, lemmatizer,
 morphological analyzer, and dependency parser for natural languages.  Using
 Memory-Based Learning techniques, Frog analyses word tokens in incoming
 UTF-8 text files, and assigns a dependency graph to each sentence.
 .
 Frog is a product of the Centre of Language and Speech Technology at
 Radboud University Nijmegen, it subsumes previous work by the
 ILK Research Group (Tilburg University, The Netherlands) and
 the CLiPS Research Centre (University of Antwerp, Belgium).
 .
 This package provides the runtime files required to run programs that use
 Frog.
