Description: cool game where you pop out the bubbles!
 Frozen-Bubble is a clone of the popular "Puzzle Bobble" game, in which
 you attempt to shoot bubbles into groups of the same color to cause
 them to pop.
 .
 Players compete as penguins and must use the arrow keys to aim a
 colored bubble at groups of bubbles. The objective is to clear all the
 bubbles off the screen before a bubble passes below a line at the
 bottom.
 .
 It features 100 single-player levels, a two-player mode, music and
 striking graphics. A level editor is also included to allow players to
 create and play their own levels.
