Description: metapackage for the latest version of FSL
 FSL is a comprehensive library of image analysis and statistical tools
 for fMRI, MRI and DTI brain imaging data. The suite consists of various
 command line tools, as well as simple GUIs for its core analysis pipelines.
 Among others, FSL offers implementations of standard GLM analysis,
 white matter tractography, tissue segmentation, affine and non-linear
 co-registration, and independent component analysis.
 .
 Some FSL components require additional data packages (fsl-atlases,
 fsl-first-data, fsl-possum-data) that are currently available from the
 NeuroDebian repository only. For more information on how to obtain these
 data packages visit http://neuro.debian.net.
 .
 Users aiming to perform a complete FSL installation (including
 all data components) are advised to install the 'fsl-complete'
 package from NeuroDebian.
