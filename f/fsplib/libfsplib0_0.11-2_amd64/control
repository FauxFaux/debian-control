Description: FSP v2 protocol stack library - shared library
 This is C library which support talking with FSP server using FSP v2 protocol
 and provides posix-like file manipulation interface.
 .
 FSP is a protocol, a bit like FTP, for moving files around. It's designed for
 anonymous archives, and has protection against server and network overloading.
 It doesn't use connections, so it can survive things falling over. It's also
 designed to prevent network congestion, so it can be very nice for large
 transfers over slow links.
 .
