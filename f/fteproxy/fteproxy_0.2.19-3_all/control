Description: programmable proxy for censorship circumvention
 fteproxy provides transport-layer protection to resist keyword filtering,
 censorship and discrimantory routing policies. Its job is to relay
 datastreams, such as web browsing traffic, by encoding the stream into
 messages that satisfy a user-specified regular expression and are thus
 considered "safe" by the censors.
