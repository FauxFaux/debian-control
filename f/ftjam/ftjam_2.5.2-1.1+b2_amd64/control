Description: FreeType version of Jam, a replacement for make
 This is a version of Jam with additional features and bugfixes, which
 is maintained by the FreeType project.
 .
 Perforce's Jam (formerly called Jam/MR, available in package "jam")
 is a powerful and highly customizable utility to build programs and
 other things, that can run on Un*x, Nt, VMS, OS/2 and Macintosh MPW,
 using portable Jamfiles.  It can build large projects spread across
 many directories in one pass, and can run jobs in parallel where make
 would not.
 .
 It takes some time to fully apprehend, especially when one's already
 accustomed to make(1), but there's no comparison in power when
 comparing these two tools.
 .
 Standard rules:
  - can automatically extract header dependencies for C/C++ (you can
 customize for you own language)
  - provide for automatic "clean", "install", "uninstall" rules,
 so that an automake-like tool is not needed
