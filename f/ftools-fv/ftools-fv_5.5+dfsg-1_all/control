Description: Tool for viewing and editing FITS format files
 Fv provides a graphical user interface to data stored in FITS
 (Flexible Image Transport System) files.  Local files can be created,
 viewed and edited, files on the internet can be opened read-only
 through the http and ftp protocols. Through the POWplot program,
 FITS data can be visualized in a large variety of styles.  An
 interface to the SkyView online database allows for searching,
 downloading, and plotting of images and object lists for a region of
 the sky.
