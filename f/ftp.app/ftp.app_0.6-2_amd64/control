Description: File transfer protocol application for GNUstep
 This is a file transfer application (RFC 765) featuring a compact and easy
 interface. As most applications in GAP it tries to work on both GNUstep and
 MacOS X and retain the utmost possible similarity among the two version to
 ease working in both environments.
 .
 FTP supports different port arbitration modes: "default", standard "PORT"
 (also known as active) and standard "PASV" (also known as passive).
