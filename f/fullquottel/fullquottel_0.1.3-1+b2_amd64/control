Description: tool for recognizing top-posted e-mail and usenet replies
 Fullquottel performs several tests to determine if a message is written in
 the top-post style (a.k.a. "TOFU" or jeopardy-style quoting) - the full
 response above and a full quote of the original message below.
 .
 Each test is customizable and has an associated score. Fullquottel returns
 the total score for the message in several forms which are useful e.g. for
 sorting e-mail.
