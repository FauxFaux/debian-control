Description: web testing tool
 This web testing tool is designed to allow testing the functionality
 and performance of web applications in the same spirit as Perl's
 WWW::Mechanize. The tool supports recording clicks through a website,
 saving them into a Python class which you can later modify, and
 playing them back later. This allows you to script your web
 applications. 'funkload' also supports performance and load testing
 your applications.
