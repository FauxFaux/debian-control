Description: literate-programming tool
 Literate-programming allows the programmer to write a program's
 code and the code's documentation, with equal importance accorded
 to both. This helps to produce well-documented code.
 .
 Unlike other literate-programming tools, funnelweb is not derived
 from Knuth's cweb.
 .
 It claims the following technical features:
  * Can be used with any programming language.
  * Runs on most platforms.
  * Mature and essentially bug-free (released 1992).
  * Simple; specifically designed to minimize errors.
  * High speed; doesn't stretch the development cycle.
  * Generates documentation in HTML and TeX forms.
 .
 This package does not include the reference, tutorial, and developer
 manuals.  See package funnelweb-doc for these.
