Description: Minimal buy-in FITS library
 Funtools, is a "minimal buy-in" FITS library and utility package developed at
 the High Energy Astrophysics Division of SAO. The Funtools library
 provides simplified access to a wide array of file types: standard
 astronomical FITS images and binary tables, raw arrays and binary event
 lists, and even tables of ASCII column data. A sophisticated region filtering
 library (compatible with ds9) filters images and tables using boolean
 operations between geometric shapes, support world coordinates, etc. Funtools
 also supports advanced capabilities such as optimized data searching using
 index files.
 .
 This library contains the shared library.
