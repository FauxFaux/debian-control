Description: mirrors a whole filesystem tree from one charset to another
 convmvfs is a FUSE (File System in Userspace) utility that transparently
 mirrors a filesystem tree converting the filenames from one charset to another
 on the fly. Only the names of files and directories are converted; the file
 content remains intact. The mirrored tree is mounted at a given mountpoint.
