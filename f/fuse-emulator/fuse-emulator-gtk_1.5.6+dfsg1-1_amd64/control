Description: The Free Unix Spectrum Emulator (GTK+ version)
 Fuse is a Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulator. It supports several models
 (including 16K/48K/128K/+2/+2A/+3 and some clones), with quite

  * Working Spectrum +3e and SE, Timex TC2048, TC2068 and TS2068,
    Pentagon 128, "512" (Pentagon 128 with extra memory) and 1024 and
    Scorpion ZS 256 emulation.
  * Runs at true Speccy speed on any computer you're likely to try it
    on.
  * It can load Z80, SZX and SNA snapshots, TAP and TZX virtual-tape
    files (including accelerated loading), MDR microdrive images and
    DSK floppy disk images, among many others.
  * Sound.
  * Built-in debugger.
  * Emulation of most of the common joysticks used on the Spectrum
    (including Kempston, Sinclair and Cursor joysticks).
  * Emulation of some of the printers you could attach to a Spectrum.
  * Support for the RZX input recording file format, including
    rollback and 'competition mode'.
  * Recording of movies to FMF files.
