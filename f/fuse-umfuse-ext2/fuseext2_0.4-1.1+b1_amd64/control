Description: File System in User Space - Module for ext2
 This module for the FUSE kernel service allows any FUSE-enabled user to mount
 Second Extended file systems, e.g. disk images.
 .
 The module has been initially written for UMView, the user-mode
 implementation of View-OS. If you want to allow completely user-mode disk
 images mounting (with no kernel/superuser support at all), take a look at
 umview-mod-umfuseext2 and its dependencies.
