Description: File System in User Space - Module for FAT
 This module for the FUSE kernel service allows any FUSE-enabled user to mount
 FAT file systems.
 .
 The module has been initially written for UMView, the user-mode
 implementation of View-OS. If you want to allow completely user-mode disk
 images mounting (with no kernel/superuser support at all), take a look at
 umview-mod-umfusefat and its dependencies.
