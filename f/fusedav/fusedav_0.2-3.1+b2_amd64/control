Description: filesystem to mount WebDAV shares
 fusedav is a userspace filesystem driver that allows you to mount WebDAV
 shares. This way you can transparently edit and manage files on a remote
 server.
 .
 It uses FUSE (Filesystem in USErspace), thus you need a FUSE-enabled kernel.
 .
 WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is a set of
 extensions to the HTTP protocol which allows users to collaboratively edit
 and manage files on remote web servers.
