Description: filesystem client based on the SMB file transfer protocol
 fusesmb is a filesystem client based on the SMB file transfer protocol. This
 gives the ability to transparently exchange files with Microsoft Windows
 servers and Unix servers running Samba.
 .
 It is based on FUSE (userspace filesystem framework for Linux), thus you will
 have to prepare fuse kernel module to be able to use it.
