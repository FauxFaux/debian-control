Description: Fuzzing program to test applications
 Fusil is a fuzzing framework designed to expose bugs in software by
 changing random bits of its input.
 .
 It helps to start process with a prepared environment (limit memory,
 environment variables, redirect stdout, etc.), start network client or
 server, and create mangled files. Fusil has many probes to detect
 program crash: watch process exit code, watch process stdout and syslog
 for text patterns (eg. "segmentation fault"), watch session duration,
 watch cpu usage (process and system load), etc.
 .
 Fusil is based on a modular architecture. It computes a session score
 used to guess fuzzing parameters like number of injected errors to
 input files.
