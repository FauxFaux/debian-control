Description: collaborative development tool - database (remote)
 FusionForge provides many tools to aid collaboration in a
 development project, such as bug-tracking, task management,
 mailing-lists, SCM repository, forums, support request helper,
 web/FTP hosting, release management, etc. All these services are
 integrated into one web site and managed through a web interface.
 .
 This dummy package tells FusionForge you installed the database on a
 separate machine.  It preserves the fusionforge-db virtual dependency,
 to configure the database before depending packages in single-server
 installs (e.g. plugins activation requires a populated db).
