Description: FusionForge plugin - HTTPD authentication
 FusionForge provides many tools to aid collaboration in a
 development project, such as bug-tracking, task management,
 mailing-lists, SCM repository, forums, support request helper,
 web/FTP hosting, release management, etc. All these services are
 integrated into one web site and managed through a web interface.
 .
 This plugin contains an HTTPD authentication mechanism for
 FusionForge. It allows Apache authentication to be reused for
 FusionForge, for instance where Kerberos is used.
