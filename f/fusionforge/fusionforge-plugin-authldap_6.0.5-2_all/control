Description: FusionForge plugin - LDAP authentication
 FusionForge provides many tools to aid collaboration in a
 development project, such as bug-tracking, task management,
 mailing-lists, SCM repository, forums, support request helper,
 web/FTP hosting, release management, etc. All these services are
 integrated into one web site and managed through a web interface.
 .
 This plugin contains an LDAP authentication mechanism for
 FusionForge. It allows users to authenticate against an external LDAP
 directory, and syncs some of their personal information from LDAP
 into the FusionForge database.
