Description: FusionForge plugin - Globalsearch
 FusionForge provides many tools to aid collaboration in a
 development project, such as bug-tracking, task management,
 mailing-lists, SCM repository, forums, support request helper,
 web/FTP hosting, release management, etc. All these services are
 integrated into one web site and managed through a web interface.
 .
 This plugin contains a cross-FusionForge search engine.  You can
 declare a list of other FusionForge sites, and search for projects
 hosted on these forges from your own.
