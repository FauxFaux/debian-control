Description: FusionForge plugin - Menu Tabs Manager
 FusionForge provides many tools to aid collaboration in a
 development project, such as bug-tracking, task management,
 mailing-lists, SCM repository, forums, support request helper,
 web/FTP hosting, release management, etc. All these services are
 integrated into one web site and managed through a web interface.
 .
 This plugin allows each project to define extra tabs with arbitrary
 titles and links, next to the login menu (headermenu),
 in the main menu (outermenu) or in the project menu (groupmenu).
