Description: FusionForge plugin - Hudson/Jenkins
 FusionForge provides many tools to aid collaboration in a
 development project, such as bug-tracking, task management,
 mailing-lists, SCM repository, forums, support request helper,
 web/FTP hosting, release management, etc. All these services are
 integrated into one web site and managed through a web interface.
 .
 This plugin contains the Hudson subsystem of FusionForge. It allows each
 FusionForge project to have its own Hudson, and gives some
 control over it to the project administrator.
