Description: FusionForge plugin - Project labels
 FusionForge provides many tools to aid collaboration in a
 development project, such as bug-tracking, task management,
 mailing-lists, SCM repository, forums, support request helper,
 web/FTP hosting, release management, etc. All these services are
 integrated into one web site and managed through a web interface.
 .
 This can be used to highlight some projects on a forge, for instance
 for a "project of the month".
