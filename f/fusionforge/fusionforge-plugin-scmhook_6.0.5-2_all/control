Description: FusionForge plugin - Scmhook
 FusionForge provides many tools to aid collaboration in a
 development project, such as bug-tracking, task management,
 mailing-lists, SCM repository, forums, support request helper,
 web/FTP hosting, release management, etc. All these services are
 integrated into one web site and managed through a web interface.
 .
 This plugin contains a set of commit hooks (e-mail notifications,
 tracker integration, conformity...) that can be enabled for each
 project independently.
