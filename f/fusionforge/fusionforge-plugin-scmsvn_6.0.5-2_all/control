Description: FusionForge plugin - Subversion
 FusionForge provides many tools to aid collaboration in a
 development project, such as bug-tracking, task management,
 mailing-lists, SCM repository, forums, support request helper,
 web/FTP hosting, release management, etc. All these services are
 integrated into one web site and managed through a web interface.
 .
 This plugin contains the Subversion subsystem of FusionForge. It allows
 each FusionForge project to have its own Subversion repository, and gives
 some control over it to the project's administrator.
