Description: FusionForge plugin - System authentication via LDAP
 FusionForge provides many tools to aid collaboration in a
 development project, such as bug-tracking, task management,
 mailing-lists, SCM repository, forums, support request helper,
 web/FTP hosting, release management, etc. All these services are
 integrated into one web site and managed through a web interface.
 .
 This plugin maintains data about users, groups and memberships in an
 LDAP directory that can be used for NSS/PAM system authentication (or
 for other uses).
