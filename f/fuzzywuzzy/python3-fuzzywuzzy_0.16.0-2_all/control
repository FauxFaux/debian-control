Description: Python 3 module for fuzzy string matching
 Various methods for fuzzy matching of strings in Python, including:
 .
   - String similarity: Gives a measure of string similarity between 0 and 100.
   - Partial string similarity: Inconsistent substrings are a common problem
     when string matching. To get around it, use a "best partial" heuristic
     when two strings are of noticeably different lengths.
   - Token sort: This approach involves tokenizing the string in question,
     sorting the tokens alphabetically, and then joining them back into a
     string.
   - Token set: A slightly more flexible approach. Tokenize both strings, but
     instead of immediately sorting and comparing, split the tokens into two
     groups: intersection and remainder.
 .
 This package contains fuzzywuzzy for Python 3.
