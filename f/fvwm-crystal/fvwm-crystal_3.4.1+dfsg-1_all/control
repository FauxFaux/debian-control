Description: Pretty Desktop Environment based on FVWM
 FVWM-crystal creates an easy to use desktop environment
 using fvwm2 as its window manager and main core. From
 another point of view its just a very powerful fvwm
 configuration.
 .
 A file manager may be optionally used to display desktop icons,
 ROX-filer and nautilus are supported for this task. FVWM-crystal
 furthermore has UI integration for various music players, among
 them audacious and mpd.
 .
 There is also a very powerful menu system that has an extensive
 default configuration but may be customized and extended by each
 user to fit personal requirements.
