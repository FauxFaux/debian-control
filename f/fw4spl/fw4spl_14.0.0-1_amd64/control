Description: FrameWork for Software Production Line
 FW4SPL consists of a set of cross-platform C++ libraries.
 For now, FW4SPL focuses on the problem of medical images
 processing and visualization, and propose an open-source
 application called VRRender, which is able to load a
 series of images stored in DICOM format (uncompressed
 and JPEG) and 3D-modeled patients for medical review.
