Description: Firewall log analyzer
 fwlogwatch produces ipchains, netfilter/iptables, ipfilter, Cisco IOS and
 Cisco PIX log summary reports in text and HTML form and has a lot of
 options to find and display relevant patterns in connection attempts. With
 the data found it can also generate customizable incident reports from a
 template and send them to abuse contacts at offending sites or CERT
 coordination centers. Finally, it can also run as daemon and report
 anomalies or start countermeasures.
