Description: Tools to manage UEFI firmware updates (signed)
 fwupdate provides functionality to update system firmware. It has been
 initially designed to update firmware using UEFI capsule updates, but
 it is designed to be extensible to other firmware update standards.
 .
 This package contains just the signed version of the fwupdate binary,
 needed if your system has UEFI Secure Boot enabled. It depends on the
 normal fwupdate package for everything else.
