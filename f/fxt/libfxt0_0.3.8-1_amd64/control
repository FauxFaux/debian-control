Description: Multithreaded tracing library
 FxT is a library and associated tools that can be used to analyze the
 performance of multithreaded programs which can potentially use a
 hybrid thread scheduler (i.e. a user-level scheduler on top of a
 kernel-level one). The Marcel thread library can take full profit from
 this library.
 .
 FxT is based on the offline analysis of traces (sequence of events recorded at
 run time).
 .
 This package contains shared libraries.
