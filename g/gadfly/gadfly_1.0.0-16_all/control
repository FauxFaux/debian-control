Description: Server and interactive shell for Gadfly SQL database
 Gadfly is a relational database management system which uses a large
 subset of very standard SQL as its query language. The underlying
 engine consists of Python modules. Gadfly stores the active database
 in memory, with logging to a file system for recovery from system or
 software failures (but not for disk failures).
 .
 This package contains an interactive shell and a server for use with
 the Gadfly SQL database.
