Description: SQL database and parser generator for Python
 Gadfly is a relational database management system which uses a large
 subset of very standard SQL as its query language. The underlying
 engine consists of Python modules. Gadfly stores the active database
 in memory, with logging to a file system for recovery from system or
 software failures (but not for disk failures).
 .
 kwParser, included as part of the Gadfly package, is a parser
 generator for Python. It transforms an abstract specification of a
 language grammar (for example, the CORBA Interface Definition
 Language), together with "interpretation functions" that define the
 semantics of the language, into a compiler or translator or
 interpreter.
Python-Version: 2.7
