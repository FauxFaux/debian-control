 .
 Feature:
  - Multiple backup sets that can be scheduled to run at specific times via
    cron.
  - Each of these backup sets can contain multiple remote or local data
    backups.
  - Backup sets that are started via cron schedules will generate log files
    for each of the data backups in the backup sets.
  - The backup logfiles will have the same names as the individual backup sets.
  - Individual backup sets can be run manually and the progress can be viewed
    in the progress tab.
  - Remote backups are fully automatic, differential and encrypted.
  - Keys are created for each host, uploaded and then installed on the remote
    hosts using a combination of ssh-keygen/scp and ssh.
  - Makes remote synchronizations scheduleable.
