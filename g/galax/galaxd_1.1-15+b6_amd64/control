Description: XQuery implementation with static typing - network servers
 Galax is an implementation of XQuery, the W3C XML Query Language.
 .
 Galax implements XQuery 1.0 as specified by the W3C, as well as XPath 2.0,
 which is subset of XQuery 1.0.
 .
 Galax is a Schema-aware implementation of XQuery and supports static
 typing. Also thanks to that, Galax is a really fast implementation of the
 language.
 .
 Galax supports some advanced XQuery features, such as XML Schema validation,
 XML updates, XQuery optimization and projection, applications of XQuery to Web
 services.
 .
 This package contains galaxd, the Galax network server which executes query
 plans issued by remote clients. Extra helpers for remote execution (zerod and
 webgui) are also provided by this package.
