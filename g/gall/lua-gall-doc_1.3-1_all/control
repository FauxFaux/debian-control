Description: Documentation for lua-gall
 Gall is a Git abstraction layer for Lua which implements a set of Lua objects
 which can interact with git repositories (via libgit2 where possible).
 .
 Gall allows a Lua program to examine refs and objects, and to fully create
 git commits without needing to create a working tree on disk.
 .
 This package contains the documentation on how to use the Gall library.
