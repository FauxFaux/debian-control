Description: Gambas image effects
 Gambas is a free development environment based on a Basic interpreter
 with object extensions, like Visual Basic(tm) (but it is NOT a clone!).
 .
 This is a new component for applying many various effects on images.
 The effects source code was ported from the KDE libkdefx library, which
 includes itself some ImageMagick algorithms, and from the KolourPaint
 program.
