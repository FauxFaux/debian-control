Description: Gambas smtp protocol component
 Gambas is a free development environment based on a Basic interpreter
 with object extensions, like Visual Basic(tm) (but it is NOT a clone!).
 .
 This package allows sending emails using smtp protocol.
 It contains one control, SmtpClient, that is used for defining the SMTP
 server, the SMTP port, the recipients, the sender, the subject, the mail
 contents, some attachments, and for finally sending the mail.
