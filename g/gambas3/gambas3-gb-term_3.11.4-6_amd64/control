Description: Terminal manager for Gambas
 Gambas is a free development environment based on a Basic interpreter
 with object extensions, like Visual Basic(tm) (but it is NOT a clone!).
 .
 This component allows one to manage terminals, with an API very close to
 the one provided by the operating system.
