 Quake II server automatically, with any suitable engine.

 To make this package useful, you will need to create and install some
 non-distributable packages by using the game-data-packager package:
 either quake2-full-data or quake2-demo-data. Creating quake2-full-data
 requires data files from a Quake II installation or CD-ROM.
