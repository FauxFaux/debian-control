Description: Quake III Arena menu entry and launcher scripts
 This package contains a launcher script and menu entry to play
 Quake III Arena or Quake III: Team Arena with the ioquake3 engine.
 .
 To make this package useful, you will need to create and install the
 non-distributable quake3-data or quake3-demo-data package, by using
 the game-data-packager package.
 .
 quake3-data requires pak0.pk3 from a Quake III installation or CD-ROM.
 quake3-demo-data only requires freely downloadable files, but is
 not necessarily reliable.
 .
 game-data-packager (>= 39) can also produce a package for the official
 expansion pack Quake III: Team Arena. An additional menu entry should appear
 automatically if that expansion are installed.
