Description: classic gothic/horror-themed first person shooter
 Quake is a classic first-person shooter game by id Software,
 released in 1996. This package contains a launcher script and menu
 entry to play Quake with any suitable engine.
 .
 To make this package useful, you will need to create and install the
 non-distributable quake-registered or quake-shareware package, by using the
 game-data-packager package.
 .
 Creating quake-registered requires data files from a Quake installation or
 CD-ROM.
 .
 Creating quake-shareware requires the shareware version of Quake.
 .
 game-data-packager (>= 45) can also produce packages for the official Episode
 5, Dimensions of the Past (developed by MachineGames to mark Quake's 20th
 anniversary), and for the official mission
 packs Scourge of Armagon (developed by Hipnotic Software) and Dissolution
 of Eternity (developed by Rogue Entertainment). Additional menu entries
 should appear automatically if those expansions are installed.
