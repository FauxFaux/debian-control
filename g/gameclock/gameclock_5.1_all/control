Description: simple chess clock to track time in real life games
 Fairly simple application designed to track the time spent thinking
 by the players during a chess game. Various clock engines are
 available (speed chess, fischer chess, board games or hourglass). The
 graphical interface is keyboard-driven and is intended to be minimal
 and simple. The code is made to be extensible to other game types.
