Description: cluster virtualization manager - RAPI client library (Python 3)
 Ganeti is a virtual server cluster management tool built on top of the
 Xen and KVM virtualization technologies and other free software. It
 provides an automated environment to manage highly available virtual
 machine instances.
 .
 It is designed to facilitate cluster management of virtual servers using
 commodity hardware, and to provide fast and simple recovery after physical
 failures. It can take care of operations such as redundant disk creation
 and management, operating system installation (in cooperation with
 OS-specific install scripts), startup, shutdown, and failover of instances
 between physical systems.
 .
 This package provides an RAPI (Remote API) client library for Python 3.
