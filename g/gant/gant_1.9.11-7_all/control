Description: Groovy build framework based on scripting Ant tasks
 Gant is a build tool for scripting Ant tasks using Groovy instead of
 XML to specify the build logic. A Gant build specification is a
 Groovy script and so can bring all the power of Groovy to bear
 directly, something not possible with Ant scripts. Whilst it might be
 seen as a competitor to Ant, Gant uses Ant tasks for many of the
 actions, so Gant is really an alternative way of doing builds using
 Ant, but using a programming language rather than XML to specify the
 build rules.
