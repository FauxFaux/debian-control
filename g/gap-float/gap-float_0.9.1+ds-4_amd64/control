Description: multi-precision floating-point computation for GAP
 GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra with particular
 emphasis on computational group theory, but which has already proved
 useful also in other areas.
 .
 This GAP package brings to GAP floating-point numbers with arbitrary
 precision; it is based on MPFR, MPFI, MPC, CXSC, and FPLLL.
