Description: Database of primitive groups for GAP
 GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra with particular
 emphasis on computational group theory, but which has already proved
 useful also in other areas.   In the example text, gap is used to
 analyse Rubik's Cube using group theory.  A kernel implements a Pascal-like
 language.
 .
 This package contains the database of primitive groups.
 .
 This is a transitional package.
 It can be safely removed after the installation is complete.
