Description: Large database of small groups for GAP
 GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra with particular
 emphasis on computational group theory, but which has already proved
 useful also in other areas.   In the example text, gap is used to
 analyse Rubik's Cube using group theory.  A kernel implements a Pascal-like
 language.
 .
 The Small Groups Library is a catalogue of groups of `small' order.
 This package contains the groups data and identification routines for groups
 .
   * of order at most 2000 except 1024.
   * of cubefree order at most 50 000.
   * of order p^n for n <= 6 and all primes p.
   * of squarefree order.
   * whose order factorises in at most 3 primes.
   * of order q^n * p for q^n dividing 2^8, 3^6, 5^5, 7^4 and p prime
     different to q
 .
 The Small Groups Library provides access to these groups and a method to
 identify the catalogue number of a given group.
