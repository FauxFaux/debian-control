Description: Database of small groups for GAP
 GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra with particular
 emphasis on computational group theory, but which has already proved
 useful also in other areas.   In the example text, gap is used to
 analyse Rubik's Cube using group theory.  A kernel implements a Pascal-like
 language.
 .
 The Small Groups Library is a catalogue of groups of `small' order.
 This package contains the groups data and identification routines for groups
 of order up to 1000 except 512, 768 and groups whose order factorises in at
 most 3 primes.
 .
 Note that data for order 512, 768 and between 1000 and 2000 except 1024
 are available separately in the gap-small-groups-extra packages.
 .
 This is a transitional package.
 It can be safely removed after the installation is complete.
