Description: GRaph Algorithms using PErmutation groups for GAP
 GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra with particular
 emphasis on computational group theory, but which has already proved
 useful also in other areas.
 .
 This package implements computing with graphs and groups for GAP.
 GRAPE is primarily designed for constructing and analysing graphs
 related to groups, finite geometries, and designs; special emphasis
 is placed on the determination of regularity properties and subgraph
 structure.
