Description: LAGUNA GAP package
 GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra with particular
 emphasis on computational group theory, but which has already proved
 useful also in other areas.
 .
 LAGUNA stands for `Lie AlGebras and UNits of group Algebras'.
 .
 This package provides GAP with functionality for calculation of the
 normalized unit group of the modular group algebra of the finite p-group
 and for investigation of Lie algebra associated with group algebras and
 other associative algebras.
