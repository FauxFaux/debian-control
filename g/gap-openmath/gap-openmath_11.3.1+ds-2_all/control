Description: OpenMath phrasebook for GAP
 GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra with particular
 emphasis on computational group theory, but which has already proved
 useful also in other areas.
 .
 This package allows GAP to import and export mathematical objects
 encoded in OpenMath, for the purpose of exchanging them with other
 applications that are OpenMath enabled.
