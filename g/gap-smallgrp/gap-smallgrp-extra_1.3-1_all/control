Description: GAP SmallGrp - The GAP Small Groups Library
 GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra, with particular emphasis
 on Computational Group Theory. GAP provides a programming language, a library
 of thousands of functions implementing algebraic algorithms written in the GAP
 language as well as large data libraries of algebraic objects. GAP is used in
 research and teaching for studying groups and their representations, rings,
 vector spaces, algebras, combinatorial structures, and more.
 .
 The GAP Small Groups Library is a catalogue of groups of `small' order.
 This package contains the groups data and identification routines for groups
 .
   * of order at most 2000 except 1024.
   * of cubefree order at most 50 000.
   * of order p^n for n <= 6 and all primes p.
   * of squarefree order.
   * whose order factorises in at most 3 primes.
   * of order q^n * p for q^n dividing 2^8, 3^6, 5^5, 7^4 and p prime
     different to q
   * of order p^7 with p = 3,5,7,11.
 .
 The Small Groups Library provides access to these groups and a method to
 identify the catalogue number of a given group.
