Description: Systems Of Nearrings And Their Applications for GAP
 GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra with particular
 emphasis on computational group theory, but which has already proved
 useful also in other areas.
 .
 This package provides to GAP methods for the construction and analysis
 of finite nearrings.
