Description: toric variety for GAP
 GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra with particular
 emphasis on computational group theory, but which has already proved
 useful also in other areas.
 .
 This package provides for GAP routines for working with toric varieties
 and dealing with cones and related combinatorial geometric object.
