Description: GAP computer algebra system, compiler and development files
 GAP is a system for computational discrete algebra, with particular emphasis
 on Computational Group Theory. GAP provides a programming language, a library
 of thousands of functions implementing algebraic algorithms written in the GAP
 language as well as large data libraries of algebraic objects. GAP is used in
 research and teaching for studying groups and their representations, rings,
 vector spaces, algebras, combinatorial structures, and more.
 .
 This package contains the GAP compiler and the headers files and
 objects files necessary to build GAP packages.
 .
 The GAP compiler (GAC) creates C code from GAP code and then calls
 the system's C compiler to produce machine code from it. This can
 result in a speedup.
