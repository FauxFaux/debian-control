Description: development library of the Genome Analysis Toolbox
 The GATB-CORE project provides a set of highly efficient
 algorithms to analyse NGS data sets. These methods enable
 the analysis of data sets of any size on multi-core desktop
 computers, including very huge amount of reads data coming
 from any kind of organisms such as bacteria, plants,
 animals and even complex samples (e.g. metagenomes).

 By itself GATB-CORE is not an NGS data analysis tool.
 However, it can be used to create such tools. There already
 exist a set of ready-to-use tools relying on GATB-CORE
 library: see https://gatb.inria.fr/software/
 .
 This package contains the static library and the header files
 of the gatb-core library.
