Description: dynamic library of the Genome Analysis Toolbox
 The GATB-CORE project provides a set of highly efficient
 algorithms to analyse NGS data sets. These methods enable
 the analysis of data sets of any size on multi-core desktop
 computers, including very huge amount of reads data coming
 from any kind of organisms such as bacteria, plants,
 animals and even complex samples (e.g. metagenomes).
 Read more about GATB at https://gatb.inria.fr/.
 By itself GATB-CORE is not an NGS data analysis tool.
 However, it can be used to create such tools. There already
 exist a set of ready-to-use tools relying on GATB-CORE
 library: see https://gatb.inria.fr/software/
 .
 This package contains the dynamic library.
