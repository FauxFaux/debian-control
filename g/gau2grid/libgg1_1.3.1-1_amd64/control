Description: Computing gaussians on a grid
 gau2grid is a python-generated C library for vectorized computation of grid to
 gaussian collocation matrices. The core of gau2grid is generating the
 collocation matrices between a real space grid and a gaussian basis set
 expanded to a given angular momenta.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
