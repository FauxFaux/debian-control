Description: Gaviota chess endgame tablebases
 Gaviota is a chess engine. Gaviota generates and uses its own Endgame
 Tablebases (EGTBs) with its own format. It contains "distance to
 mate" information, which is how many moves are needed to mate the
 opponent, or to be mated. This package provides the pre-generated
 Gaviota endgame tablebases.
