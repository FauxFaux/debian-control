Description: Gaviota chess endgame tablebase probing library (development package)
 Gaviota is a chess engine. Gaviota generates and uses its own Endgame
 Tablebases (EGTBs) with its own format. It contains "distance to
 mate" information, which is how many moves are needed to mate the
 opponent, or to be mated. The Gaviota Tablebases can be probed from
 your own program (engine or interface) using this library.
 .
 This package provides a static library and header files.
