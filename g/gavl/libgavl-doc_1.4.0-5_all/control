Description: low level audio and video library - documentation files
 Gavl handles all the details of audio and video formats like colorspaces,
 samplerates, multichannel configurations etc. It provides standardized
 definitions for those formats as well as container structures for carrying
 audio samples or video images inside an application.
 .
 In addition, it handles the sometimes ugly task to convert between all
 these formats and provides some elementary operations (copying, scaling,
 alpha blending etc).
 .
 This package contains the documentation about Gavl.
