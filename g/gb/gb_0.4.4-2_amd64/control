Description: project based build tool for Go
 "gb" is a proof of concept replacement build tool for the Go programming
 language.
 .
 "gb" operates on the concept of a project. A gb project is a workspace
 for all the Go code that is required to build your project.
 .
 A gb project is a folder on disk that contains a subdirectory named
 src/. That's it, no environment variables to set.
 .
 You can create as many projects as you like and move between them simply
 by changing directories.
