Description: Graphical frontend for the Music Player Daemon (MPD)
 gbemol allows you to use MPD with a userfriendly interface. Features include
 an easy-to-use, tag-oriented library browser, a two mode playlist, cover art
 support (APIC tag only, for now), system tray icon docking, song, album and
 artist information.
 .
 Music Player Daemon is a server that allows remote access for playing audio
 files, streams and managing playlists. The daemon is controlled through a
 client which need not run on the same computer mpd runs on.
