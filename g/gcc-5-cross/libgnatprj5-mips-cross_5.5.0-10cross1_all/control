Description: GNU Ada compiler Project Manager (shared library)
 GNAT is a compiler for the Ada programming language. It produces optimized
 code on platforms supported by the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).
 .
 GNAT uses project files to organise source and object files in large-scale
 development efforts. The libgnatprj library exports GNAT project files
 management for use in other packages, most notably ASIS tools (package
 asis-programs) and GNAT Programming Studio (package gnat-gps). It is
 licensed under the pure GPL; all programs that use it must also be
 distributed under the GPL, or not distributed at all.
 .
 This package contains the runtime shared library.
