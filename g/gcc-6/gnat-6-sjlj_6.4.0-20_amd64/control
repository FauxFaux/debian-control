Description: GNU Ada compiler (setjump/longjump runtime library)
 GNAT is a compiler for the Ada programming language. It produces optimized
 code on platforms supported by the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).
 .
 This package provides an alternative runtime library that handles
 exceptions using the setjump/longjump mechanism (as a static library
 only).  You can install it to supplement the normal compiler.
