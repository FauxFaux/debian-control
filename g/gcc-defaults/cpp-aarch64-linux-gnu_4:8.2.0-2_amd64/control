Description: GNU C preprocessor (cpp) for the arm64 architecture
 The GNU C preprocessor is a macro processor that is used automatically
 by the GNU C compiler to transform programs before actual compilation.
 .
 This package has been separated from gcc for the benefit of those who
 require the preprocessor but not the cross-compiler for arm64 architecture.
 .
 This is a dependency package providing the default GNU C preprocessor
 for the arm64 architecture.
