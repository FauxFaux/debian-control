Description: GNU C preprocessor (cpp) for the s390x architecture
 The GNU C preprocessor is a macro processor that is used automatically
 by the GNU C compiler to transform programs before actual compilation.
 .
 This package has been separated from gcc for the benefit of those who
 require the preprocessor but not the cross-compiler for s390x architecture.
 .
 This is a dependency package providing the default GNU C preprocessor
 for the s390x architecture.
