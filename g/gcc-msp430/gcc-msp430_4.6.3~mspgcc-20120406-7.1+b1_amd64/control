Description: GNU C compiler (cross compiler for MSP430)
 This is the GNU C compiler, a fairly portable optimizing compiler for C
 for TI's MSP430 architecture.  This package is primarily for MSP430
 developers and cross-compilers and is not needed by normal users.
 .
 BEWARE: due to a bug in the memory layout reference of FRAM-based chips,
 this package DOES NOT WORK with MSP430FR5xxx chips (eg. FraunchPad devkit).
 DO NOT use gcc-msp430 on that chip series, as you will lose access to
 JTAG and BSL, and permanently BRICK your chip!
