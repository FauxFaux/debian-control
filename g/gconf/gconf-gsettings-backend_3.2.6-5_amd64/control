Description: GNOME configuration database system - GSettings back-end
 GConf is a configuration database system for storing application
 preferences.
 .
 This package contains a backend to enable applications that use the
 newer GSettings framework to store their preferences to use GConf for
 storing the actual values.
 .
 You will need to explicitly enable it through your environment with
 GSETTINGS_BACKEND=gconf. It is strongly recommended to not use this
 backend unless you really know what youâ€™re doing.
 .
 This package is for legacy applications and no longer used by GNOME.
