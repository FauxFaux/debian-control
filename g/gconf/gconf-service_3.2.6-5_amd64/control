Description: GNOME configuration database system (D-Bus service)
 GConf is a configuration database system for storing application
 preferences. It supports default or mandatory settings set by the
 administrator, and changes to the database are instantly applied to all
 running applications. It is written for the GNOME desktop but doesn't
 require it.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus enabled daemon that is used internally
 by the GConf library to access configuration data.
 .
 This package is for legacy applications and no longer used by GNOME.
