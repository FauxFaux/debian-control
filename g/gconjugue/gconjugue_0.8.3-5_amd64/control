Description: GTK+ program to conjugate Brazilian verbs
 Graphical program to conjugate Portuguese verbs as spoken in Brazil.
 .
 If the entered expression is not a verb, GConjugue tries to find it
 among the conjugated forms of known verbs. It also has the option of
 conjugating verbs as ordinary Brazilians do. In fact, Brazilians of
 different regions deviate from the normative grammar in different ways,
 but the conjugation displayed will already help foreigners to grasp
 what Brazilians are saying.
 .
 This program is a graphical front-end to console tool known as conjugue
 (package brazilian-conjugate). Alternatively, you can use conjugar, the
 text only version for gconjugue.
