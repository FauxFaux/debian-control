Description: The GNU debugger for MSP430
 GDB is a source-level debugger, capable of breaking programs at
 any specific line, displaying variable values, and determining
 where errors occurred. Currently, it works for C, C++, Fortran
 Modula 2 and Java programs. A must-have for any serious
 programmer.
 This package is primarily for MSP430 developers and cross-compilers and
 is not needed by normal users or developers.
 .
 This package has been compiled to target the TI's MSP430 architecture.
