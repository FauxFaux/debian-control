Description: GNU dbm database routines (legacy support development files) 
 GNU dbm ('gdbm') is a library of database functions that use extendible
 hashing and works similarly to the standard UNIX 'dbm' functions.
 .
 The basic use of 'gdbm' is to store key/data pairs in a data file, thus
 providing a persistent version of the 'dictionary' Abstract Data Type
 ('hash' to perl programmers).
 .
 This package includes development files, required to build old
 programs, that use legacy 'dbm' interface. For new programs, please
 use modern interface, provided by libgdbm6 and libgdbm-dev.
