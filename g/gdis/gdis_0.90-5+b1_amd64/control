Description: molecular and crystal model viewer
 A GTK+ based program for the display and manipulation of
 isolated molecules, periodic systems and crystalline habits.
 It is in development, but is nonetheless fairly functional.
 It has the following features:
 .
  * Support for several file types (CIF, BIOSYM, XYZ,
    XTL, MARVIN, and GULP)
  * A simple molecular creation and manipulation tool
  * A dialogue for creating starting configurations for
    molecular dynamics simulations
  * Assorted tools for visualization (geometry information,
    region highlighting, etc.)
  * Animation of BIOSYM files (also rendered animations,
    see below)
 .
 GDIS also allows you to perform the following functions
 through other packages:
 .
  * Model rendering (courtesy of POVRay)
  * Energy minimization (courtesy of GULP)
  * Morphology calculation (courtesy of cdd)
  * Space group processing (courtesy of SgInfo)
  * View the Periodic Table (courtesy of GPeriodic)
  * Load additional filetypes, such as PDB (courtesy of Babel)
