 Geographic, as gdnsd offers a plugin system for geographic (or other sorts of)

 gdnsd has a strong focus on high performance, low latency service. It does
 not offer any form of caching or recursive service, and does not support
 DNSSEC.

 This package provides the core gdnsd daemon and basic plugins.
