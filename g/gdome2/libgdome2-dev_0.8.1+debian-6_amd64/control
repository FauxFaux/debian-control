Description: Development files for libgdome2
 gdome2 is a fast, light and complete DOM level2 implementation based
 on libxml2.  Although it has been written for the GNOME project, it
 can be used stand-alone.
 .
 DOM (Document Object Model) is a standard interface for manipulating
 XML documents. A DOM implementation (also called a host implementation)
 is what makes a parsed XML or HTML document available for processing
 using a DOM interface.
 .
 libgdome2 currently supports the "Core", "XML", "Events" and
 "MutationEvents" modules from the DOM2 Recommendation.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static libraries for
 developing with libgdome2-0.
