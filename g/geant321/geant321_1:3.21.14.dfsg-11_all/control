Description: [Physics] Particle detector description and simulation tool
 GEANT is a framework for simulating the passage of subatomic particles
 through matter, for instance, particle detectors.  For maximum flexibility,
 GEANT simulations are performed by linking FORTRAN code supplied by the user
 with the GEANT library, then running the resulting executable.
 .
 This package includes gxint, a script that makes this linking step more
 convenient.
