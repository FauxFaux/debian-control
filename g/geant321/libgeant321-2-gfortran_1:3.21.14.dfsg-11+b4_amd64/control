Description: [Physics] Library for GEANT 3.21
 GEANT is a framework for simulating the passage of subatomic particles
 through matter, for instance, particle detectors.  For maximum flexibility,
 GEANT simulations are performed by linking FORTRAN code supplied by the user
 with the GEANT library, then running the resulting executable.
 .
 This package includes the libgeant321 library required by GEANT 3.21.  Note
 that in order to compile and link programs against this library, you must
 also install the libgeant321-2-dev package.
