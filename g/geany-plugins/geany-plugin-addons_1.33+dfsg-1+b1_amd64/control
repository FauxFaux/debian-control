Description: miscellaneous plugins for Geany
 This plugin adds various small addons to Geany which aren't worth an
 individual plugin, but might still be useful for people.
  * DocList: This addon places a new item in the toolbar and when clicked
    offers a menu listing all open files plus the 'Close All' and 'Close Other
    Documents' menu items. This can be useful to quickly access open files and
    switch to them.
  * OpenURI: Adds 'Open URI' and 'Copy URI' menu items to the editor menu when
    the word under the cursor looks like a URI. 'Open URI' uses the browser
    command configured in Geany to open it.
  * Tasks: The tasks plugin goes through a file being edited and picks out
    lines with "TODO" or "FIXME" in them. It collects the text after those words
    and puts them in a new "Tasks" tab in the message window. Clicking on a task
    in that tab takes you to the line in the file where the task was defined.
  * Systray: Adds a status icon to the notification area (systray) and
    provides a simple popup menu with some basic actions. It can also be used
    to quickly show and hide the Geany main window.
 .
 Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment using the
 Gtk+ toolkit.
