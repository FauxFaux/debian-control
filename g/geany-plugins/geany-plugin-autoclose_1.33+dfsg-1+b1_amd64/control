Description: auto-closing plugin for Geany
 This plugin enables auto-closing features. Auto-closing works while you typing
 and intellectually helps you to write code.
 .
 Features:
  * auto-close for: { }, [ ], ( ), " ", ' ', < >, ` `
  * customizeable auto-closing inside strings and comments
  * delete pairing character if you pressed BackSpace
  * suppress inserting one char twice (if you type "{}" you will get "{}", not
    "{}}")
  * enclose selected text into brackets instead of removing selection (select
    text and type "(" or ")" to enclose selection into "()")
  * keep selection when enclosing
  * for C-like languages enclosing selection into "{}" makes auto-indentation
    (select text and type "{" or "}" - text will be enclosed and indented)
  * enclosing in {} moves cursor to beginning (before "{" character)
  * for C-like languages to insert {}-block you do not need to select text
    precisely: plugin detects boundaries automatically, just ensure that
    selection covers lines you need to indent (works like TAB indentation)
  * fix auto-indent inside {} (makes full indent for this block)
  * auto-close curly bracket by pressing Enter
  * auto-close functions (``"sin(|" -> "sin(|);"``) with doubling suppression
    (for C/C++ languages only)
  * remove paring brace when pressing Shift+BackSpace, unindent {}-blocks
  * add semicolon after ``struct {|};`` and ``class {|};``
  * move cursor to closed char by pressing Tab
 .
 Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment using the
 Gtk+ toolkit.
