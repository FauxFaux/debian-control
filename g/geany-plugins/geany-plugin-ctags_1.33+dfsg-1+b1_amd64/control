Description: ctags plugin for Geany
 GeanyCtags adds a simple support for generating and querying ctags files
 for a Geany project.
 .
 Even though Geany supports symbol definition searching by itself within the
 open files (and with a plugin support within the whole project), tag
 regeneration can become too slow for really big projects. This is why this
 plugin was created. It makes it possible to generate the tag file only once
 and just query it when searching for a particular symbol
 definition/declaration. This approach is fine for big projects where most
 of the codebase remains unchanged and the tag positions remain more or
 less static.
 .
 Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment using the
 Gtk+ toolkit.
