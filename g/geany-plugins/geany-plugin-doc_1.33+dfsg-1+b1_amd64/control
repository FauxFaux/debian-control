Description: documentation plugin for Geany
 Geanydoc is a plugin for the Geany IDE which is intended to be used to search
 for documentation API from different sources. It allows execution of specified
 commands on the current word at the cursor position or otherwise specified via
 a dialog to obtain this documentation. This documentation is displayed in the
 geany buffer as a tab called *DOC*, or may be displayed in an external program.
 .
 After installing this package, you'll need to enable the "Doc" plugin
 and then setup a keyword binding for it in Geany's preferences dialogue.
 .
 Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment using the
 GTK+ toolkit.
