Description: extra selection plugin for Geany
 The Extra Selection plugin adds the following functions to Geany:-
  * Go to matching brace and select (select to matching brace)
  * Go to line and select (select to line)
  * Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Left/Right/Home/End key - same as Ctrl+Shift, but for
    rectangular selection.
  * Column mode - while active, all (Ctrl)-Shift-Arrow keys do rectangle
    selection instead of stream.
 .
 Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment using the
 Gtk+ toolkit.
