Description: macro plugin for Geany
 Geanymacro is a plugin to provide user defined macros for Geany.
 This plugin allows you to record and use your own macros. Macros are
 sequences of actions that can then be repeated with a single key
 combination. So if you had dozens of lines where you wanted to delete
 the last 2 characters, you could simple start recording, press End,
 Backspace, Backspace, down line and then stop recording. Then simply
 trigger the macro and it would automatically edit the line and move to
 the next.
 .
 Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment using the
 Gtk+ toolkit.
