Description: numbered bookmarks plugin for Geany
 Geanynumberedbookmarks is a plugin to provide users with 10 numbered
 bookmarks (in addition to the usual bookkmarks).
 Normally if you had more than one bookmark, you would have to cycle
 through them until you reached the one you wanted. With this plugin you
 can go straight to the bookmark that you want with a single key
 combination.
 .
 Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment using the
 Gtk+ toolkit.
