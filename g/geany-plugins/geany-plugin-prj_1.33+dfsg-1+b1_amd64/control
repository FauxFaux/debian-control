Description: alternative project manager for Geany
 GeanyPrj is a plugin for Geany that provides an alternative method for managing
 projects in Geany, which moves away from Geany's default project management
 style, which is session-based, instead implementing a system which
 automatically opens a project when oen of its files are opened.
 .
 Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment using the
 GTK+ toolkit.
