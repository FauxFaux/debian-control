Description: projectorganizer plugin for Geany
 Project Organizer is an extension of Geany's project management displaying
 a tree of files belonging to the project in the sidebar. In addition, it
 enables complete indexing of the project files (and having code completion,
 syntax highlighting and tag  definition/declaration jumps for the whole
 project) quick swapping between header and source files, improved opening
 of includes, searching project files by name and more. External
 directories can be attached to the project to extend the plugin's
 functionality to related directories outside the project tree. The plugin
 was created with big projects in mind so everything works fast enough
 even with projects consisting of tens of thousands of files.
 .
 Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment using the
 GTK+ toolkit.
