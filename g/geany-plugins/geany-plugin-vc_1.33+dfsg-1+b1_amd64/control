Description: VCS plugin for Geany
 GeanyVC is a plugin for Geany that provides a uniform way of accessing the
 different version-control systems inside the Geany IDE. Only a small subset of
 vc operations are implemented, which are:
  * diff
  * log
  * status
  * revert
  * commit
 .
 Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment using the
 Gtk+ toolkit.
