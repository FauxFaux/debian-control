Description: Tools for the Gearman distributed job queue
 Gearman is a system to farm out work to other machines, dispatching function
 calls to machines that are better suited to do work, to do work in parallel,
 to load balance lots of function calls, or to call functions between languages.
 .
 This package contains some command line tools for manipulating gearman jobs.
