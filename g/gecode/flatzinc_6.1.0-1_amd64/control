Description: constraint problem modelling language
 FlatZinc is a low-level modelling language for constraint
 problems. It is designed to be easily interfaceable to constraint
 solvers (like Gecode). For more information on FlatZinc, please refer
 to the MiniZinc pages of the G12 project
 <http://www.g12.cs.mu.oz.au/minizinc/>.
 .
 We provide a parser that reads a FlatZinc model from a file, and
 returns a Gecode Space object that represents the model. We also
 provide a simple front-end, an executable program that reads a
 FlatZinc model and prints the solution (if any) on the standard
 output.
 .
 The FlatZinc interpreter that ships with Gecode version 4.4.0
 supports the FlatZinc language and MiniZinc global constraint
 definitions of MiniZinc version 1.6.0.
