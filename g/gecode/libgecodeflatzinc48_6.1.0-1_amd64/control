Description: Gecode support for FlatZinc modelling language
 Gecode is a toolkit for developing constraint-based systems and
 applications. Gecode provides a constraint solver with
 state-of-the-art performance while being modular and extensible.
 .
 FlatZinc is a low-level modelling language for constraint
 problems. It is designed to be easily interfaceable to constraint
 solvers (like Gecode). For more information on FlatZinc, please refer
