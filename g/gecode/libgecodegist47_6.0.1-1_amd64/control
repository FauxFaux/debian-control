Description: Gecode Interactive Search Tool library
 Gecode is a toolkit for developing constraint-based systems and
 applications. Gecode provides a constraint solver with
 state-of-the-art performance while being modular and extensible.
 .
 This package contains libgecodegist, a graphical debugging tool, and
 libgecodedriver, a set of helper classes for writing standalone
 programs.  They have been separated from the main Gecode library
 package to avoid pulling in Qt as a dependency.
