Description: GPL EDA -- Electronics design software (attribute editor)
 The gEDA project has produced and continues working on a full GPL'd suite and
 toolkit of Electronic Design Automation tools. These tools are used for
 electrical circuit design, schematic capture, simulation, prototyping, and
 production. Currently, the gEDA project offers a mature suite of free software
 applications for electronics design, including schematic capture, attribute
 management, bill of materials (BOM) generation, netlisting into over 20
 netlist formats, analog and digital simulation, and printed circuit board
 (PCB) layout.
 .
 This package contains gattrib, the attribute editor.
