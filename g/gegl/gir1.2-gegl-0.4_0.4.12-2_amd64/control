Description: GObject introspection data for the Generic Graphics Library
 GEGL (Generic Graphics Library) is a graph based image processing
 framework.
 .
 GEGL's original design was made to scratch GIMP's itches for a new
 compositing and processing core. This core is being designed to have
 minimal dependencies and a simple well defined API.
 .
 This package contains introspection data for the library.
 .
 It can be used by packages using the GIRepository format to generate
 dynamic bindings.
