Description: perl interface to the LLNL genders cluster management utilities
 A Perl API for querying the genders file, for LLNL genders cluster
 configuration management. It is used by
 system administration scripts that need to manipulate lists of nodes or
 attributes and for performance or other reasons cannot do so via
 repeated calls to the Nodeattr utility.
