Description: C library for parsing and querying a genders database
 Genders is a static cluster configuration database used for cluster
 configuration management.  It is used by a variety of tools and
 scripts for management of large clusters.  The genders database is
 typically replicated on every node of the cluster. It describes the
 layout and configuration of the cluster so that tools and scripts can
 sense the variations of cluster nodes. By abstracting this information
 into a plain text file, it becomes possible to change the
 configuration of a cluster by modifying only one file.
