Description: Examples for the Generator Scripting Language code generator
 GSL/4.1 is a code construction tool.  It will generate code in all
 languages and for all purposes.  If this sounds too good to be true,
 welcome to 1996, when we invented these techniques.  Magic is simply
 technology that is twenty years ahead of its time. In addition to
 code construction, GSL has been used to generate database schema
 definitions, user interfaces, reports, system administration tools
 and much more.
 .
 This package contains examples to get started with gsl.
