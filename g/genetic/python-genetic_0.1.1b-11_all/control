Description: genetic algorithms in Python
 python-genetic provides genetic algorithms for Python, as often used
 in artificial intelligence. It should be able to solve any problem that
 consists in minimizing functions.
 .
 You'll find some demos using Genetic in this package, including an
 impressively simple program that provides a solution to the well-known TSP
 (Travelling Salesman Problem). Also, make sure to read
 demo/genetic_demo_2.py for the list of the special "magic" genes that make
 Genetic really fun and ... living !
