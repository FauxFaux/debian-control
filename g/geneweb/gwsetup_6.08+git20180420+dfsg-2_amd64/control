Description: utilities to configure and manipulate Geneweb databases
 Geneweb allows keeping track of ancestral data. It is a powerful
 system for maintaining a set of data about your family history. It
 supports much of the GEDCOM tag system for data storage, and can be
 used either as your primary system for archiving genealogical data,
 or as a web service (through a CGI interface) for publishing your
 data for others to use.
 .
 Gwsetup is a command-line program which also includes a mini web server
 to help Geneweb users to setup and manipulate genealogical databases
 to be used with the main Geneweb program.
