Description: web interface interacting with Geneweb databases
 Geneweb allows keeping track of ancestral data. It is a powerful
 system for maintaining a set of data about your family history. It
 supports much of the GEDCOM tag system for data storage, and can be
 used either as your primary system for archiving genealogical data,
 or as a web service (through a CGI interface) for publishing your
 data for others to use.
 .
 Gwtp is a CGI program allowing owners of databases hosted on a
 GeneWeb site to upload and download their databases on the site and
 change their configuration parameters.
