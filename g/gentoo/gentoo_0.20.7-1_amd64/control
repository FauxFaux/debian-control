Description: fully GUI-configurable, two-pane X file manager
 gentoo is a two-pane file manager for the X Window System. gentoo lets the
 user do (almost) all of the configuration and customizing from within the
 program itself. If you still prefer to hand-edit configuration files,
 they're fairly easy to work with since they are written in an XML format.
 .
 gentoo features a fairly complex and powerful file identification system,
 coupled to an object-oriented style system, which together give you a lot
 of control over how files of different types are displayed and acted upon.
 Additionally, over a hundred pixmap images are available for use in file
 type descriptions.
 .
 gentoo was written from scratch in ANSI C, and it utilizes the GTK+ toolkit
 for its interface.
