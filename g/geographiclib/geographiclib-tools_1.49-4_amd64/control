Description: C++ library to solve some geodesic problems -- tools
 GeographicLib is a small set of C++ classes for converting between
 geographic, UTM, UPS, MGRS, geocentric, and local cartesian coordinates,
 for geoid calculations, and for computing geodesic. It is a suitable
 replacement for the core functionality provided by NGA Geotrans.
 .
