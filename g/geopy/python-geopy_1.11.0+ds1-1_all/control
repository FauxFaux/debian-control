Description: geocoding toolbox for Python
 geopy makes it easy for developers to locate the coordinates of addresses,
 cities, countries, and landmarks across the globe using third-party geocoders
 and other sources of data, such as wikis.
 It also comes with the necessary means for parsing geographical coordinates
 and geodesic distance calculation (using great-circle distance or Vincenty
 distance). The distance module also contains useful routines for converting
 between length and angle units.
