Description: Documentation for libgeronimo-jpa-2.0-spec-java
 Documentation for the Java Persistence API that is the Java API for the
 management of persistence and object/relational mapping for Java EE and Java
 SE environments.
 .
 The goal of this specification is to provide an object/relational mapping
 facility for the Java application developer using a Java domain model
 to manage a relational database.
 .
 Persistence in this context covers three areas:
  - The API itself, defined in the javax.persistence package.
  - The Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL).
  - Object/relational metadata.
 .
 The Java Persistence 2.0 specification addresses improvements in the areas of
 domain modeling, object/relational mapping, EntityManager and Query
 interfaces, and the Java Persistence query language. It adds an API for
 criteria queries, a metamodel API, and support for validation.
 .
 This package contains only API of JSR-317 spec. Apache OpenJPA and
 EclipseLink are implementations of this spec.
