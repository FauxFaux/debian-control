Description: Documentation for libgeronimo-osgi-support-java
 Documentation for Java libraries that allow the use of OSGi framework with
 Geronimo existing projects. They allow lookup and registration of components.
 .
 - geronimo-osgi-locator.jar: Allow performing class and components lookups
   with OSGi support.
   .
 - geronimo-osgi-registry.jar: Facilitate the use of Geronimo specs providers
   (components typically plugged in to the JRE through META-INF/services
   resources) like geronimo-validation-1.0-spec (Geronimo JSR-303 Bean
   Validation Spec API).
   .
   The service created by this library will maintain a registry of factory
   class that can be used by the spec bundles to locate factory classes that
   reside in other bundles.
