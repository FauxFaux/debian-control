Description: Documentation for libgeronimo-validation-1.1-spec-java
 Documentation for the Apache Geronimo implementation of the JSR-349 Bean
 Validation Spec API.
 .
 JSR 349 defines a metadata model and API for JavaBean validation.
 The default metadata source is annotations, with the ability to override and
 extend the meta-data through the use of XML validation descriptors. The
 API is not tied to a specific application tier or programming model.
 .
 It is specifically not tied to either the web tier or the persistence tier,
 and is available for both server-side application programming,
 as well as rich client Swing application developer.
 .
 This package contains only API of JSR-349 spec. Hibernate Validator is the
 reference implementation of this spec.
