Description: Console-based interface to Gerrit
 Gertty is a console-based interface to the Gerrit Code Review system.
 As compared to the web interface, the main advantages are:
 .
 Workflow -- the interface is designed to support a workflow similar
 to reading network news or mail.  In particular, it is designed to
 deal with a large number of review requests across a large number
 of projects.
 .
 Offline Use -- Gertty syncs information about changes in subscribed
 projects to a local database and local git repos.  All review
 operations are performed against that database and then synced back
 to Gerrit.
 .
 Speed -- user actions modify locally cached content and need not
 wait for server interaction.
 .
 Convenience -- because Gertty downloads all changes to local git
 repos, a single command instructs it to checkout a change into that
 repo for detailed examination or testing of larger changes.
