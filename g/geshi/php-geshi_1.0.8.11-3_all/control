Description: Generic Syntax Highlighter
 GeSHi aims  to be a simple but powerful highlighting class,
 with the following goals:
 .
    * Support for a wide range of popular languages
    * Easy to add a new language for highlighting
    * Highly customisable output formats
 .
 GeSHi aims to  do this all as quickly  as possible. Many customisable
 features of GeSHi facilitate speed increases, and you can easily find
 a balance  between the amount of  highlighting done and  the speed in
 which it is done.
