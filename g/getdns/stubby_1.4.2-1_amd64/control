Description: modern asynchronous DNS API (stub resolver)
 getdns is a modern asynchronous DNS API.  It implements DNS entry
 points from a design developed and vetted by application developers,
 in an API specification edited by Paul Hoffman.  This API intends to
 offer application developers a modernized and flexible way to access
 DNS security (DNSSEC) and other powerful new DNS features; a
 particular hope is to inspire application developers towards
 innovative security solutions in their applications.
 .
 This package contains stubby daemon - the DNS Privacy Stub Resolver.
