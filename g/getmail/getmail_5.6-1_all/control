 accounts, and reliably delivers into a qmail-style Maildir, mbox
 file or to a command (pipe delivery) like maildrop or procmail,
 specified on a per-account basis. getmail also has support for
 domain (multidrop) mailboxes.
 .
 Supported protocols:
 POP3, POP3-over-SSL, IMAP4, IMAP4-over-SSL, and SDPS mail.
