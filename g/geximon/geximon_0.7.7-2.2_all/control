Description: a monitor for the exim MTA
 geximon is a Gtk2 reimplementation of eximon, an X monitor for
 the exim mail transport agent. It has all features of the original
 (tracking the log, managing the mail queue, plotting, etc.) and more. It
 also integrates with exiwhat (allowing you to manage active exim instances),
 exigrep, and eximstats. The interface is intuitive, compact, and easy to use.
