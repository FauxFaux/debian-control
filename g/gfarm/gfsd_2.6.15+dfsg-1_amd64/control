Description: Gfarm file system daemon
 The Gfarm file system is designed to turn commodity PCs into nodes of
 a distributed storage network, implementing the Grid Datafarm
 architecture for global petascale data-intensive computing. It solves
 performance and reliability problems in NFS and AFS by means of
 multiple file replicas, and not only prevents performance degradation
 due to access concentration, but also supports fault tolerance and
 disaster recovery.
 .
 This package provides the Gfarm file system daemon, which equips a
 host to function as a storage node for the network.
