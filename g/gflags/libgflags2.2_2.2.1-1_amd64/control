Description: commandline flags module for C++ (shared library)
 gflags is a library that implements commandline flags processing. As
 such it's a replacement for getopt(). It has increased flexibility,
 including built-in support for C++ types like string, and the ability
 to define flags in the source file in which they're used.
 .
