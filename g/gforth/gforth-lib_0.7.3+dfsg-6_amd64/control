Description: GNU Forth Language Environment architecture-dependent files
 This is the GNU'ish implementation of a Forth programming environment.
 .
 Forth, as a language, is best known for being stack-based, and completely
 extensible.  Each Forth environment provides one or more dictionaries of
 pre-defined words, and programming in Forth consists of defining and
 executing new words that are combinations of previously defined words.  It
 has been said that learning Forth changes forever the way you think about
 writing programs.
 .
 This package provides the architecture-dependent precompiled libraries.
