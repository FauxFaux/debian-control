Description: VHDL compiler/simulator
 GHDL is a compiler and simulator for VHDL, a Hardware Description Language.
 GHDL is not an interpreter: it allows you to analyse and elaborate sources to
 generate machine code from your design. Native program execution is the only
 way for high speed simulation.
 .
 GHDL offers three machine code generation backends: one based on GCC, one
 using the LLVM compiler suite and a GHDL specific one called mcode. These are
 available in the ghdl-gcc, ghdl-llvm and ghdl-mcode packages respectively.
 Both the GCC and LLVM backends create highly optimized code for excellent
 simulation performance while simulations compiled with the GCC backend also
 allow coverage testing using gcov. The mcode backend creates less performant
 code but makes up for it with much faster compilation. It is therefore
 preferable for smaller projects without large or long running simulations.
 .
 Multiple backends can be installed at the same time and selected by either
 invoking the desired GHDL directly (as ghdl-gcc, ghdl-llvm or ghdl-mcode) or
 by providing a GHDL_BACKEND environment variable (containing gcc, llvm or
 mcode) while invoking ghdl.
 .
 This package contains the common files for all backends and requires at least
 one backend to be installed.
