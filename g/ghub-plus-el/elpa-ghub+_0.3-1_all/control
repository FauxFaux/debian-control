Description: thick GitHub API client built on ghub
 Provides some sugar for `ghub'. See package `apiwrap'
 for generated function usage instructions.
 .
 Its aim is to provide the common functionality most
 helpful for application development.
 .
 Since ghub+ is built on ghub, any and all features
 you find lacking in ghub+ can be done with ghub without
 needing to dig into either package's internals.
 However, ghub+ provides some macros you may find helpful
 in development; see Extending for details.
