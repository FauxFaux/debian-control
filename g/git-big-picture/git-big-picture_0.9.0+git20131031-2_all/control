Description: Visualization tool for Git repositories
 git-big-picture is a visualization tool for Git repositories. You can think of
 it as a filter that removes uninteresting commits from a DAG modelling a Git
 repository and thereby exposes the big picture: for example the hierarchy of
 tags and branches. git-big-picture supports convenience output options and can
 filter different classes of commits. It uses the Graphviz utility to render
 images that are pleasing to the eye.
