Description: Suite to help with RPM packages in Git repositories
 This package contains the following tools:
  * gbp buildpackage-rpm: build a package out of a git repository, check for
    local modifications and tag appropriately
  * gbp import-srpm: import existing RPM source packages into a git
    repository
  * gbp pq-rpm: manage patches easily
 .
 These tools are currently in an experimental state. Branch names and
 repository layouts might change without lots of prior warning.
