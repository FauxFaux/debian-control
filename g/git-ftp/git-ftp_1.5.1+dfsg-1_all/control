Description: Git powered FTP client written as shell script
 git-ftp is a shell script for uploading Git tracked files to a FTP server. By
 default, it uploads only those files which have changed since the last upload.
 This saves time and bandwidth. It can even work with different branches.
 See manpage for more options.
