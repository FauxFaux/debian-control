 git-publish prepares patches consistently and stores them as git tags for
 future reference.
 .
 Features:
  - It works with individual patches as well as patch series.
  - No constraints are placed on git workflow, both vanilla git commands and
  custom workflow scripts are compatible with git-publish.
  - Email sending and pull requests are fully integrated so that publishing
  patches can be done in a single command.
  - Hook scripts called during patch preparation can be used to add custom
  format checking or automated test runs.
