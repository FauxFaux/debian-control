Description: encrypted git repositories
 This lets git store git repositories in encrypted form.
 It supports storing repositories on rsync or sftp servers.
 It can also store the encrypted git repository inside a remote git
 repository. All the regular git commands like git push and git pull
 can be used to operate on such an encrypted repository.
 .
 The aim is to provide confidential, authenticated git storage and
 collaboration using typical untrusted file hosts or services.
