Description: User Documentation for Givaro (obsolete)
 Givaro is a C++ library for arithmetic and algebraic computations.
 Its main features are implementations of the basic arithmetic of many
 mathematical entities: Primes fields, Extensions Fields, Finite
 Fields, Finite Rings, Polynomials, Algebraic numbers, and Arbitrary
 precision integers and rationals (C++ wrappers over gmp).
 .
 Givaro also provides data-structures and templated classes for the
 manipulation of basic algebraic objects, such as vectors, matrices
 (dense, sparse, structured), univariate polynomials (and therefore
 recursive multivariate).
 .
 It contains different program modules and is fully compatible with
 the LinBox linear algebra library and the Athapascan environment,
 which permits parallel programming.
 .
 This is a transitional dummy package. The 'givaro-user-doc' package
 has been renamed to 'libgivaro-doc', which has been installed
 automatically. This 'givaro-user-doc' package can be safely removed
 from the system if no other package depends on it.
