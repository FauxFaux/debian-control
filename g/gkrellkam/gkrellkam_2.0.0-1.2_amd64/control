Description: GKrellM plugin that displays a periodically updating image
 GKrellKam is basically wmGrabImage in a GKrellM panel, except that it
 is more flexible (you can specify a local or remote image, or a list of
 local or remote images, or a script that outputs the right image, etc).
 The image (any format or size) is resized to a thumbnail and placed in
 a GKrellM panel, where it is updated periodically. Multiple images are
 rotated.
 .
 This plugin is useful for keeping track of webcams, weather maps, or
 any other kind of changing image information.
