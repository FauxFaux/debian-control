Description: Plugin for gkrellm to lock the screen and make screenshots
 This plugin gives easy access to screenlock and screenshot facilities.
 For screenshot it uses ImageMagick. The plugin displays animations
 (like a screensaver) along with 'Lock' and 'Shoot' buttons to be
 clicked on. With the 'Shoot' button one can either grab a window,
 selected area or the whole screen. It's also possible to delay the
 screenshot by a given number of seconds. Another feature is that
 grabbed images can be viewed with your preferred image viewer. Pressing
 'Lock' button will lock the screen and start your screen saver. (You
 need to have xscreensaver installed to use this feature.)
