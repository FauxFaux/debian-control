Description: Embed LaTeX equations in HTML files
 GladTeX is a preprocessor that enables the use of LaTeX equations within HTML
 files. The equations, embedded in <EQ>...</EQ> tags, as if within $$..$$ in
 LaTeX, is fed through LaTeX and replaced by images.
 .
 Additionally all images get an alt-tag for alternative texts that contains the
 LaTeX-equivalent of the image. This is handy for text-mode browsers or blind
 people using a screen reader.
