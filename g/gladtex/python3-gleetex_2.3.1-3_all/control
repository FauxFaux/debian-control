Description: Module to embed LaTeX equations in HTML files
 GleeTeX is a python module to create images from formulas. It can parse HTML
 documents and replace all occurrences of <eq>some formula</eq> through images.
 Each image will get an alt attribute as well, which is useful for screen
 readers or text-mode browsers.
 It can also just create formula images out of LaTeX formulas and the process
 can be embedded into a web application.
 .
 GleeTeX is able to convert multiple images concurrently and it also keeps a
 cache of already converted formulas, speeding up the conversion.
