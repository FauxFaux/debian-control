Description: development files for glbinding
 glbinding leverages modern C++11 features like enum classes,
 lambdas, and variadic templates, instead of relying on macros;
 all OpenGL symbols are real functions and variables.
 .
 It provides type-safe parameters, per feature API header, lazy
 function resolution, multi-context and multi-thread support,
 global and local function callbacks, meta information about the
 generated OpenGL binding and the OpenGL runtime, as well as tools
 and examples for quick-starting your projects.
 .
 This package provides the development files.
