Description: node builder library for OpenGL-based Doom-style games
 glBSP is a node builder specially designed to be used with OpenGL ports of
 the DOOM game engine. It adheres to the "GL-Friendly Nodes" specification,
 which means it adds some new special nodes to a WAD file that makes it very
 easy (and fast!) for an OpenGL DOOM engine to compute the polygons needed
 for drawing the levels.
 .
 There are many DOOM ports that understand the GL Nodes which glBSP creates,
 including EDGE, the Doomsday engine (JDOOM), Doom3D, PrBoom, and Vavoom.
