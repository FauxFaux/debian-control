Description: OpenGL tubing and extrusion library development files
 The GLE Tubing and Extrusion library is an extension to OpenGL for drawing
 tubing and extrusions, including surfaces of revolution, sweeps, tubes,
 polycones, polycylinders, and helicoids.  Generally the extruded surface
 is specified with a 2D polyline that is extruded along a 3D path.  A local
 coordinate system allows for additional flexibility in the primitives
 drawn.  Extrusions may be texture mapped in a variety of ways.

 This package contains header files and static libraries.
