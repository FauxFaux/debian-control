Description: OpenGL Extension Wrangler MX - development environment
 The OpenGL Extension Wrangler, GLEW for short, is a library that
 handles initialization of OpenGL extensions in a portable and simple
 way. Once the program initializes the library and checks the
 availability of extensions, it can safely call the entry points defined
 by the extension. Currently GLEW supports almost all the extensions
 found in the OpenGL extension registry (https://www.opengl.org/registry).
 .
 This package contains the development libraries compiled with GLEW_MX.
