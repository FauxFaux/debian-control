Description: documentation for the OpenGL Image (GLI) library
 OpenGL Image (GLI) is a header only C++ image library for graphics software.
 .
 GLI provides classes and functions to load image files (KTX and DDS),
 facilitate graphics APIs texture creation, compare textures, access texture
 texels, sample textures, convert textures, generate mipmaps, etc.
 .
 This library works perfectly with OpenGL or Vulkan but it also ensures
 interoperability with other third party libraries and SDK. It is a good
 candidate for software rendering (raytracing / rasterisation), image
 processing, image based software testing or any development context that
 requires a simple and convenient image library.
 .
 This package provides the documentation.
