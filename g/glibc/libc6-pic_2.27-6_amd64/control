Description: GNU C Library: PIC archive library
 Contains an archive library (ar file) composed of individual shared objects.
 This is used for creating a library which is a smaller subset of the
 standard libc shared library. The reduced library is used by debian-installer
 and may be useful for custom installation media and in embedded systems.
