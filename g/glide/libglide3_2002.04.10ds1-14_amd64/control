Description: graphics library for 3Dfx Voodoo 3+ based cards - shared libraries
 This package allows you to use the 3D functions of cards based on
 3dfx Interactive, Inc's Voodoo Banshee, Voodoo 3, Voodoo 4, and
 Voodoo 5 chipsets.
 You should install it if you use such a card.
 .
 This package does not need the 3dfx kernel driver, as it uses DRI instead.
