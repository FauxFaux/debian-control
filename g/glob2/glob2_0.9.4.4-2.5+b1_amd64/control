Description: innovative Real Time Strategy game
 Globulation 2 is an ongoing, multi-platform project to create innovative
 high-quality RTS gameplay, minimizing micro-management and assigning tasks
 to the units automatically. You just have to order the number of units you
 want for a selected task and the units will do their best to satisfy your
 requirements.
 .
 Glob2 can be played by a single player, through your Local Area Network,
 or over the Internet, thanks to the Ysagoon Online Gaming meta-server. It
 also features a scripting language for versatile gameplay and an integrated
 map editor.
