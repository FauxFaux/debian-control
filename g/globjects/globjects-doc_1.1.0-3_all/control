Description: documentation for globjects
 globjects provides object-oriented interfaces to the OpenGL API (3.0 and
 higher). The main goals are much reduced code to use OpenGL in your
 rendering software and fewer errors due to the underlying glbinding and
 further abstraction levels on top. Typical processes are automated and
 missing features in the used OpenGL driver are partially simulated or
 even emulated.
 .
 This package provides the documentation.
