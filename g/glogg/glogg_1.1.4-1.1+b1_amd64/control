Description: Smart interactive log explorer using Qt
 glogg is a multi-platform GUI application to browse and search through long or
 complex log files. It is designed with programmers and system administrators
 in mind and can be seen as a graphical, interactive combination of grep and
 less.
 .
 Main features include:
  * Accept egrep regular expression to search or filter the log.
  * Interactively display results of the search in a second, filtered window.
  * Colorize the log and the search results.
  * Read the file directly from disk, without loading it into memory.
  * Happily handle big (>4 GiB) files.
  * Read UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 encoded files.
  * Follow a log in real-time as it is written to disk.
  * Allow one to insert marks in the logs to interesting lines.
  * Support less/vim like keyboard commands to move around the file.
