Description: Java binding to the GNU Linear Programming Kit
 GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) is intended for solving large-scale
 linear programming (LP), mixed integer programming (MIP), and other
 related problems. It is a set of routines written in ANSI C and
 organized in the form of a callable library.
 .
 GLPK supports the GNU MathProg language, which is a subset of the
 AMPL language. GLPK also supports the standard MPS and LP formats.
