Description: linear programming kit with integer (MIP) support
 GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) is intended for solving large-scale
 linear programming (LP), mixed integer programming (MIP), and other
 related problems. It is a set of routines written in ANSI C and
 organized in the form of a callable library.
 .
 GLPK supports the GNU MathProg language, which is a subset of the
 AMPL language.  GLPK also supports the standard MPS and LP formats.
 .
 The GLPK package includes the following main components:
    * Revised simplex method.
    * Primal-dual interior point method.
    * Branch-and-bound method.
    * Translator for GNU MathProg modeling language.
    * Application program interface (API).
 .
 In order to get connections between the internal MathProg model
 objects and external database tables, please install the
 libiodbc2-dev (for the iODBC table driver) and libmysqlclient-dev
 (for the MySQL table driver).
