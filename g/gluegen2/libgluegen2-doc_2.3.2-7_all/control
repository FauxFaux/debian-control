Description: Tool to automatically generate the Java and JNI code
 Gluegen reads as input ANSI C header files and separate configuration files
 which provide control over many aspects of the glue code generation. GlueGen
 uses a complete ANSI C parser and an internal representation (IR) capable of
 representing all C types to represent the APIs for which it generates
 interfaces. It has the ability to perform significant transformations on the
 IR before glue code emission. GlueGen is currently powerful enough to bind
 even low-level APIs such as the Java Native Interface (JNI) and the AWT Native
 Interface (JAWT) back up to the Java programming language.
 .
 This package includes the API documentation for Gluegen package.
