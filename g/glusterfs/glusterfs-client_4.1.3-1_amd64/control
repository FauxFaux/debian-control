Description: clustered file-system (client package)
 GlusterFS is a clustered file-system capable of scaling to several
 peta-bytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over Infiniband RDMA
 or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file
 system. GlusterFS is one of the most sophisticated file system in
 terms of features and extensibility. It borrows a powerful concept
 called Translators from GNU Hurd kernel. Much of the code in GlusterFS
 is in userspace and easily manageable.
 .
 This package provides the FUSE based GlusterFS tool.
