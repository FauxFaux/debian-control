Description: utility for switching the GLX implementation
 In setups with several GLX providers (e.g. the free MESA implementation and
 proprietary graphics hardware vendor implementations) this utility
 allows one to switch between the different implementations.
 .
 Use 'update-glx --config glx' to select an implementation.
 .
 In addition to updating the alternatives, this will trigger further actions
 needed to complete the switch.
