Description: spliced and SNP-tolerant alignment for mRNA and short reads
 This package contains the programs GMAP and GSNAP as well as
 utilities to manage genome databases in GMAP/GSNAP format.
 GMAP (Genomic Mapping and Alignment Program) is a tool for aligning
 EST, mRNA and cDNA sequences.
 GSNAP (Genomic Short-read Nucleotide Alignment Program) is a tool for
 aligning single-end and paired-end transcriptome reads.
 Both tools can use a database of
  * known splice sites and identify novel splice sites.
  * known single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
 GSNAP can align bisulfite-treated DNA.
