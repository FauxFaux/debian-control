Description: ffmpeg encoders for Gmerlin
 Gmerlin is a multiformat media player with tree-like virtual directory
 structure, where you can save your files, webstreams or whatever. It
 handles even large media collections gracefully. Hardware devices appear
 also in the tree so you can open Audio-CDs, (S)VCDs, DVDs and
 DVB-broadcasts.
 .
 This package includes ffmpeg based encoders to be used by Gmerlin,
 enabling gmerlin-transcoder to encode more file formats.
