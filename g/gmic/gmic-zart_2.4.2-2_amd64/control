Description: GREYC's Magic for Image Computing - ZArt
 G'MIC is an open and full-featured framework for image processing,
 providing several different user interfaces to
 convert/manipulate/filter/visualize generic image datasets, from 1d
 scalar signals to 3d+t sequences of multi-spectral volumetric images.
 .
 This package contains ZArt, a program whose purpose is to demonstrate
 the possibilities of the G'MIC image processing language by offering
 the choice of several manipulations on a video stream acquired from a
 webcam. In other words, ZArt is a GUI for G'MIC real-time manipulations
 on the output of a webcam.
