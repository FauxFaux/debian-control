Description: factor integers using the Elliptic Curve Method -- libdev
 gmp-ecm is a free implementation of the Elliptic Curve Method (ECM)
 for integer factorization.
 .
 The original purpose of the ECMNET project was to make Richard Brent's
 prediction true, i.e. to find a factor of 50 digits or more by
 ECM. This goal was attained on September 14, 1998, when Conrad Curry
 found a 53-digit factor of 2^677-1 c150 using George Woltman's mprime
 program. The new goal of ECMNET is now to find other large factors by
 ecm, mainly by contributing to the Cunningham project, most likely the
 longest, ongoing computational project in history according to Bob
 Silverman. A new record was set by Nik Lygeros and Michel Mizony, who
 found in December 1999 a prime factor of 54 digits using GMP-ECM.
