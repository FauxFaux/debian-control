Description: Three-dimensional finite element mesh generator Python wrapper
 Gmsh is a 3D finite element grid generator with a build-in CAD engine
 and post-processor. Its design goal is to provide a fast, light and
 user-friendly meshing tool with parametric input and advanced
 visualization capabilities. Gmsh is built around four modules: geometry,
 mesh, solver and post-processing. The specification of any input to
 these modules is done either interactively using the graphical user
 interface or in ASCII text files using Gmsh's own scripting language.
 .
 See Gmsh's reference manual for a more thorough overview of Gmsh's
 capabilities.
