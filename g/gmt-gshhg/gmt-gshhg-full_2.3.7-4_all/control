Description: Full resolution coastlines for the Generic Mapping Tools
 GSHHG is a high-resolution shoreline data set amalgamated from two databases:
 Global Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Shorelines (GSHHS) and
 CIA World Data Bank II (WDBII). GSHHG contains vector descriptions at five
 different resolutions of land outlines, lakes, rivers, and political
 boundaries. This data is for use by GMT, the Generic Mapping Tools.
 .
 This package contains the full resolution coastlines which are required
 to create best quality maps with GMT.
