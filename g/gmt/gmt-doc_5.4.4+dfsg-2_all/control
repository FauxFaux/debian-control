Description: Documentation for GMT, the Generic Mapping Tools
 GMT is a collection of UNIX tools that allow users to manipulate
 (x,y) and (x,y,z) data sets (including filtering, trend fitting, gridding,
 projecting, etc.) and produce Encapsulated PostScript File (EPS) illustrations
 ranging from simple x-y plots through contour maps to artificially illuminated
 surfaces and 3-D perspective views in black and white, gray tone, hachure
 patterns, and 24-bit color.
 .
 GMT supports many common map projections plus linear, log, and power scaling,
 and comes with support data such as coastlines, rivers, and political
 boundaries.
 .
 This package contains the documentation for GMT.
