Description: Generic Mapping Tools Library - Development files
 These set of libraries allow manipulating geographic and Cartesian data sets
 (including filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and
 producing Encapsulated PostScript File (EPS) illustrations ranging from
 simple x-y plots via contour maps to artificially illuminated surfaces
 and 3-D perspective views.
 .
 This package contains the files used for development of programs that
 use the GMT libraries (headers).
