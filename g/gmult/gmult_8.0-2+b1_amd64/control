Description: figure out which letters are which numbers
 Multiplication Puzzle is a simple GTK+ 2 game that emulates the
 multiplication game found in Emacs.  Basically, a multiplication
 problem is shown with all digits replaced by letters.  Your job
 is to guess which letter represents which number.
