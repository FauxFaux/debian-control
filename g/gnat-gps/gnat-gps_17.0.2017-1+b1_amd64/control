Description: integrated development environment for C and Ada
 GNAT Programming Studio is a complete integrated development environment
 that gives access to a wide range of tools and integrates them smoothly.
 .
 GPS gives access to built-in file editing; HTML based help system;
 complete compile/build/run cycle; intelligent source navigation;
 project management; general graph technology giving access to many
 different browsers such as source dependency, project dependency, call
 graphs, etc.; fully integrated visual debugger, based on the GVD
 technology, and enhanced for inclusion in GPS; generic version control
 system, providing access to CVS, ClearCase, and possibly others in the
 future; many other tools such as a visual comparison, automatic
 generation of files, source reformatting.
 .
 GPS is fully customizable, providing several levels of customizations:
 a first level, available through the preferences dialog; a second
 level, which allows you to customize your menu items, tool bar and key
 bindings; a third level, which allows you to automate processing
 through scripts; and a fourth level, which allows any kind of very
 specific or tight integration, due to the open nature of GPS, and to
 its architecture.
 .
 GPS also integrates with existing editors such as Emacs and Vi.
 .
 This package also provides related command line tools:
  - gnatdoc extracts documentation from comments in Ada sources
  - gnatspark runs a spark tool according to a GNAT project
  - gps_cli is a command-line interface for gnat-gps
