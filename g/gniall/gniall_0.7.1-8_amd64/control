Description: program that tries to learn a human language
 gNiall attempts to learn whatever language you try to teach it. It is
 basically a dissociator: it collects statistics on sentences you type
 and tries to construct meaningful replies. gNiall is inspired by Niall,
 an Amiga program by Matthew Peck.
