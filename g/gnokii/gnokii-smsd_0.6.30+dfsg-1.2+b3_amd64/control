Description: SMS Daemon for mobile phones
 Gnokii is a suite of programs that allows communication with mobile phones.

 .
 The SMSD (SMS daemon) handles automated sending and receiving of short messages
 using a storage backend. It is designed to use modules (plugins) to work with
 different backends, and shares Gnokii's runtime configuration and libraries.
 .
 This package contains the actual daemon and a file based backend. You will
 need to install the appropriate module packages to add support for other
 backends.
