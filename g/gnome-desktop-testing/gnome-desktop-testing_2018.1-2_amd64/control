Description: runner for GNOME installed tests
 The GNOME desktop testing runner provides an execution harness for GNOME
 installed tests.
 .
 These tests are useful for verifying the functionality of software as
 installed and packaged, and complement rather than replace build-time
 ('make check') tests. For example you may wish to run the installed
 tests from a DEP-8 autopkgtest testsuite as a form of regression
 testing.
