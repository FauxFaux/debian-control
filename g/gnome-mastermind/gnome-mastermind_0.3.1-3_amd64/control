Description: Mastermindâ„¢ clone for GNOME
 The goal of this board game is to break a code using obscure hints.
 The game is played by 2 players: the codemaker (the computer) and the
 codebreaker.  The computer generates a combination of 4 colors.  The
 codebreaker has to guess that pattern (both order and colors) with
 the least number of tries.  At each turn, the codebreaker tries a
 pattern and the computer provides feedback by placing pegs in the
 score grid.  A white peg indicates a right color but wrong position;
 a colored peg means that both color and position are correctly
 guessed.
