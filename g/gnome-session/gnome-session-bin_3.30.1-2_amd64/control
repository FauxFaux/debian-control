Description: GNOME Session Manager - Minimal runtime
 The GNOME Session Manager is in charge of starting the core components
 of the GNOME desktop, and applications that should be launched at
 login time. It also features a way to save and restore currently
 running applications.
 .
 This package contains the binaries for the GNOME Session Manager, but
 no startup scripts. It is meant for those willing to start
 gnome-session by hand with the components of their choice, and for
 applications such as GDM that use gnome-session internally.
