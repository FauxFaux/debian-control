Description: daemon handling the GNOME session settings - common files
 This package contains GSettings schemas and other architecture-independent
 files for GNOME Settings Daemon. It is probably not interesting on its own for
 end users, but packages may depend on this if they only need to read and write
 settings & don't themselves care if the settings daemon is actually running or
 not.
