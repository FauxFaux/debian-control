Description: speed up the gnome-shell animation speed
 The impatience extension allows you to speed up GNOME Shell
 animation speeds.
 .
 From gnome-tweak-tool you can use a slider to scale the animation
 speed down to any percentage. A speed scale of 1 means normal speed,
 0.5 will result in animations twice as fast, 0.1 will result in
 animations being 10x faster, etc.
