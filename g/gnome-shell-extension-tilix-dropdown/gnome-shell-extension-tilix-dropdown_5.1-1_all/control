 Tilix (previosly known as terminix) is a graphical terminal
 multiplexer for GNOME.

 Quake-mode launched a quick terminal from the top similar in
 style to the terminal found in the original quake game.

 This extension adds a keyboard shortcut that allows you to
 access tilix in quake-mode (default key: F10). You can also
 configure this key in gnome-tweak-tool.
