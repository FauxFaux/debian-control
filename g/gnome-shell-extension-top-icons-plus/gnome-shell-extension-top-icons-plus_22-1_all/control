Description: GNOME Shell extension to move system tray icons to top bar
 This GNOME Shell extension alters how the Shell displays freedesktop.org
 system tray icons (status icons, notification-area icons). In the upstream
 GNOME Shell code, these icons appear in a small pop-out panel in the
 bottom left corner of the screen; this extension moves them to the
 top bar, between the clock and system menu.
 .
 Please note that each user will need to enable the extension manually, for
 example using the gnome-tweaks application.
