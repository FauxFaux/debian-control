Description: GNOME Shell time-management app
 This GNOME Shell app helps you to manage time according to the
 pomodoro technique.
 .
 Features:
  * puts a countdown timer in the GNOME Shell top panel;
  * nags you with reminders about taking a break;
  * uses full screen notifications that can be easily dismissed;
  * hides other notifications until the start of the break;
  * sets your IM (Empathy) status to "busy".
 .
 The pomodoro technique is a time and focus management method which improves
 productivity and quality of work. The name comes from a kitchen timer, which
 can be used to keep track of time. In short, you are supposed to focus on work
 for around 25 minutes and then have a well deserved break in which you should
 relax. Then when this cycle repeats for the fourth time you should take a
 longer break (have a walk or something).
