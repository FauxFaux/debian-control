Description: GNOME Split - File splitter for GNOME desktop
 Tool that allows you to split files and merge them back. It is written in Java
 and uses a GTK+ user interface (thanks to the java-gnome project). The goal is
 to offer a native implementation of similar projects which can handle multiple
 file formats (e.g. Xtremsplit).
