Description: GNOME Virtual File System (debugging libraries)
 GNOME VFS is the GNOME virtual file system.  It is the foundation of the
 Nautilus file manager.  It provides a modular architecture and ships with
 several modules that implement support for local files, http, ftp and others.
 It provides an URI-based API, a backend supporting asynchronous file
 operations, a MIME type manipulation library and other features.
 .
 This package contains unstripped shared libraries.  It is provided primarily
 to provide a backtrace with names in a debugger, to make it easier to
 interpret core dumps.  The libraries are installed in /usr/lib/debug and are
 automatically used by gdb.
