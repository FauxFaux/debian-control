Description: GNOME Virtual File System library (development files)
 GNOME VFS is the GNOME virtual file system.  It is the foundation of the
 Nautilus file manager.  It provides a modular architecture and ships with
 several modules that implement support for local files, http, ftp and others.
 It provides an URI-based API, a backend supporting asynchronous file
 operations, a MIME type manipulation library and other features.
 .
 This package provides the necessary development libraries for writing
 GNOME VFS modules and applications that use the GNOME VFS APIs.
