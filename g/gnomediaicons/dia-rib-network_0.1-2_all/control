Description: network icons scheme for Dia
 gnomeDIAicons is a package with a network icons scheme based on Gnome
 Gorilla's theme.
 .
 The purpose of this project is generate beauty icons to Dia program and
 provide a raise in its utilization against MS Visio.

 I hope it can be useful for many people. I'll provide others schemes too, but
 at first only network scheme was made.
