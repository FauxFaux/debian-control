Description: AIS receiver which uses the discriminator output of VHF receivers
 A tool for demodulating and decoding Automatic Identification System messages
 using the line input of the sound card. AIS messages are transmitted by
 marine vessels and contain their position, velocity and other interesting
 information. The messages may be saved to a mysql-database, forwarded as NMEA
