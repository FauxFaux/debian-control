Description: graphical or console backgammon program with analysis
 GNU Backgammon is a strong backgammon program (world-class with a bearoff
 database installed) usable either as an engine by other programs or as a
 standalone backgammon game.  In addition to supporting simple play, it
 also has extensive analysis features, a tutor mode, adjustable
 difficulty, and support for exporting annotated games.  It can be played
 either from a GTK+ graphical interface, optionally with a 3D board, or
 from a simple text console.
