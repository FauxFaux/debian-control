Description: COBOL compiler
 GnuCOBOL (formerly OpenCOBOL) is a free, modern COBOL compiler. GnuCOBOL
 implements a substantial part of the COBOL 85, COBOL 2002 and COBOL 2014
 standards and X/Open COBOL, as well as many extensions included in other COBOL
 compilers (IBM COBOL, MicroFocus COBOL, ACUCOBOL-GT and others).
 .
 GnuCOBOL translates COBOL into C and compiles the translated code using a
 native C compiler.
 .
 Build COBOL programs on various platforms, including GNU/Linux, Unix, Mac OS X,
 and Microsoft Windows. GnuCOBOL has also been built on HP/UX, z/OS, SPARC,
 RS6000, AS/400, along with other combinations of machines and operating
 systems.
 .
 While being held to a high level of quality and robustness, GnuCOBOL does not
 claim to be a “Standard Conforming” implementation of COBOL.
 .
 GnuCOBOL passes over 9600 of the NIST COBOL 85 test suite tests and over 750
 internal checks during build.
