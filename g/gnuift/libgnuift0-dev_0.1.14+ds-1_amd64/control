Description: libgnuift development files
 The GIFT (the GNU Image-Finding Tool) is a Content Based Image
 Retrieval System (CBIRS). It enables you to do Query By Example on
 images, giving you the opportunity to improve query results by
 relevance feedback. For processing your queries the program relies
 entirely on the content of the images, freeing you from the need
 to annotate all images before querying the collection.
 .
 The GIFT is an open framework. The communication protocol for
 client-server communication, MRML, is XML based and fully documented
 (http://www.mrml.net).
 .
 To avoid a name clash with the "gift" package (a fasttrack filesharing
 client), these packages have been named "gnuift" (also to stress that
 gnuift is a GNU project).
