Description: git merge driver for GNU ChangeLog files
 ChangeLog files *always* foul up most version control systems in
 their default configuration.
 .
 git-merge-changelog is a tool from gnulib designed to help with this
 for the case of GNU-style ChangeLogs; it can be used with at least
 git, bzr, and hg.
