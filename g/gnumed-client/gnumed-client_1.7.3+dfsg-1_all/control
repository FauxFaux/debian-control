Description: medical practice management - Client
 This is the GNUmed Electronic Medical Record. Its purpose is
 to enable doctors to keep a medically sound record on their
 patients' health. It does not currently provide functionality
 for stock keeping. Clinical features are well-tested by real
 doctors in the field.
 .
 While the GNUmed team has taken the utmost care to make sure
 the medical records are safe at all times you still need to
 make sure you are taking appropriate steps to backup the
 medical data to a safe place at appropriate intervals. Do
 not forget to test your recovery procedures, too !
 .
 Protect your data! GNUmed itself comes without
 any warranty whatsoever. You have been warned.

 This package contains the wxpython client.
