Description: GNU privacy guard "classic" - localization files (deprecated)
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC 4880.

 GnuPG 1.4 is the "classic" standalone, non-modularized
 version. Please use the gnupg package instead unless you know for
 sure that you need gnupg1.

 This package contains the translation files for the use of GnuPG
 "classic" in non-English locales.
