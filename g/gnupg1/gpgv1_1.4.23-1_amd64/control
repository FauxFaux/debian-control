Description: GNU privacy guard - signature verification tool (deprecated "classic" version)
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 .
 gpgv is a stripped-down version of gnupg which is only able to check
 signatures.  It is smaller than the full-blown gnupg and uses a
 different (and simpler) way to check that the public keys used to
 make the signature are trustworthy.
 .
 gpgv1 is the "classic" version of gpgv. It does not support as many
 cryptographic primitives as the modern version, so there are
 signatures it cannot verify.  Please use the "gpgv" package instead
 where possible.
