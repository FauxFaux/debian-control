Description: GNU Privacy Guard -- minimalist public key operations
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC4880.
 .
 This package contains /usr/bin/gpg itself, and is useful on its own
 only for public key operations (encryption, signature verification,
 listing OpenPGP certificates, etc).  If you want full capabilities
 (including secret key operations, network access, etc), please
 install the "gnupg" package, which pulls in the full suite of tools.
