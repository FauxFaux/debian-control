Description: GNU privacy guard - signature verification tool (win32 build)
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 .
 gpgv is a stripped-down version of gnupg which is only able to check
 signatures.  It is smaller than the full-blown gnupg and uses a
 different (and simpler) way to check that the public keys used to
 make the signature are trustworthy.
 .
 This is a win32 version of gpgv.  It's meant to be used by the win32-loader
 component of Debian-Installer.
