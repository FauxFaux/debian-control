Description: GNUstep GUI Backend
 It is a backend component for the GNUstep GUI Library.
 The implementation of the GNUstep GUI Library is designed in two parts.
 The first part is the front-end component which is independent of platform
 and display system.  This front-end is combined with a back-end
 component which handles all of the display system dependent such as
 specific calls to the X Window System.
 .
 This is an empty package that depends on the various backends.
