Description: Objective-C framework for socket programming with GNUstep (devel)
 Netclasses is an easy to use interface to socket programming in Objective-C
 with GNUstep. The core netclasses supports virtually any protocol, but the
 distribution comes with everything needed for TCP/IP (opening ports,
 background connections, etc.). Netclasses seamlessly integrates into
 NSRunLoop, which means there should be no need for redesigning applications
 to use it.
