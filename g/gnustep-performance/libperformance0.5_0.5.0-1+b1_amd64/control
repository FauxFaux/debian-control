Description: GNUstep performance library (runtime library)
 The GNUstep performace library implements various classes intended to
 be used in high-performance libraries and applications.  Available
 are classes for caching objects in memory for rapid access, managing
 FIFO queues, thread pools for performing methods which need to make
 use of a runloop for I/O and/or timers, for objects in parallel in
 other threads, linked list functionality, timing information,
 statistics about the number of events or the duration of operations,
 uniqued objects and more.
 .
