Description: Mount MTP devices over FUSE
 Go-mtpfs is a simple FUSE filesystem for mounting Android devices as
 an MTP device.
 .
 It will expose all storage areas of a device in the mount, and only
 reads file metadata as needed, making it mount quickly. It uses Android
 extensions to read/write partial data, so manipulating large files
 requires no extra space in /tmp.
