Description: Firmware loader for Qualcomm Gobi USB chipsets.
 gobi-loader is a firmware loader for Qualcomm Gobi USB chipsets. These devices
 appear in an uninitialised state when power is applied and require firmware to
 be loaded before they can be used as modems. gobi-loader adds a udev rule that
 will trigger loading of the firmware and make the modem usable.
