Description: Documentation for Goiardi
 Goiardi is an implementation of the Chef server written in Go. It can either
 run entirely in memory with the option to save and load the in-memory data
 and search indexes to and from disk, drawing inspiration from chef-zero, or
 it can use MariaDB/MySQL or PostgreSQL as its storage backend.
 .
 This is sphinx-generated full documentation for the Goiardi Chef server.
