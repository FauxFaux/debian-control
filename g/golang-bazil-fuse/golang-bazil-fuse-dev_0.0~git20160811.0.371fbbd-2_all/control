Description: FUSE library for Go
 bazil.org/fuse is a Go library for writing FUSE userspace filesystems.
 .
 It is a from-scratch implementation of the kernel-userspace communication
 protocol, and does not use the C library from the project called FUSE.
 bazil.org/fuse embraces Go fully for safety and ease of programming.
