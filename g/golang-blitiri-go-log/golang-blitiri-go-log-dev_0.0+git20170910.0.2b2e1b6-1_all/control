Description: Simple logging library in Go
 blitiri.com.ar/go/log is a Go package implementing a simple logger.
 .
 It implements an API somewhat similar to glog, with a focus towards simplicity
 and integration with standard tools such as systemd.
 .
 There are command line flags (defined using the flag package) to control the
 behaviour of the default logger. By default, it will write to stderr without
 timestamps; this is suitable for systemd (or equivalent) logging.
