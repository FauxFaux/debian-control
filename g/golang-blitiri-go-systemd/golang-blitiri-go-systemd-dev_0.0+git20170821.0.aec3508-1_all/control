Description: Utilities to interact with systemd sockets in Go
 blitiri.com.ar/go/systemd is a Go package implementing a way to get network
 listeners from systemd, similar to C's sd_listen_fds() and
 sd_listen_fds_with_names().
 .
 Supports named file descriptors, which is useful if your daemon needs to be
 able to tell the different ports apart (e.g. http vs https).
 .
 It can be used by daemons to listen on privileged ports without needing to run
 as root.
