Description: Go library for catching and handling panics in Go applications
 panicwrap is a Go library that re-executes a Go binary and monitors
 stderr output from the binary for a panic. When it find a panic,
 it executes a user-defined handler function. Stdout, stderr, stdin,
 signals, and exit codes continue to work as normal, making the existence
 of panicwrap mostly invisble to the end user until a panic actually
 occurs.
