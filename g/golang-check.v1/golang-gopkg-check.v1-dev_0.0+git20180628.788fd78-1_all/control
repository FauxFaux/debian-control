Description: Rich testing extension for Go's testing package
 The Go language provides an internal testing library, named testing, which is
 relatively slim due to the fact that the standard library correctness by
 itself is verified using it. The check package, on the other hand, expects the
 standard library from Go to be working correctly, and builds on it to offer a
 richer testing framework for libraries and applications to use.
 .
 Package "gopkg.in/check.v1" includes features such as:
 .
    - Helpful error reporting to aid on figuring problems out
    - Richer test helpers: assertions which interrupt the test immediately,
      deep multi-type comparisons, string matching, etc
    - Suite-based grouping of tests
    - Fixtures: per suite and/or per test set up and tear down
    - Benchmarks integrated in the suite logic (with fixtures, etc)
    - Management of temporary directories
    - Panic-catching logic, with proper error reporting
    - Proper counting of successes, failures, panics, missed tests, skips, etc
    - Explicit test skipping
    - Support for expected failures
    - Verbosity flag which disables output caching (helpful to debug hanging
      tests, for instance)
    - Multi-line string reporting for more comprehensible failures
    - Inclusion of comments surrounding checks on failure reports
    - Fully tested (it manages to test itself reliably)
