Description: [DEPRECATED] Go client for etcd
 go-etcd is a deprecated client implementation in Go for etcd.
 .
 etcd now has an official Go client, which has a nicer API and better support.
 It is available at https://github.com/coreos/etcd/tree/master/client.
 See Debian packages etcd-client, etcd-server and golang-etcd-server-dev.
 .
 We strongly suggest you use the aforementioned official Go client instead of
 go-etcd in your new projects.  For existing projects, we suggest you migrate
 to the official Go client.
 .
 This package contains the source.
