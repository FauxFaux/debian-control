Description: Form Encoding & Decoding Package for Go
 This library is designed to allow seamless, high-fidelity encoding and
 decoding of arbitrary data in application/x-www-form-urlencoded format
 and as url.Values (http://golang.org/pkg/net/url/#Values). It is intended
 to be useful primarily in dealing with web forms and URI query strings,
 both of which natively employ said format.
