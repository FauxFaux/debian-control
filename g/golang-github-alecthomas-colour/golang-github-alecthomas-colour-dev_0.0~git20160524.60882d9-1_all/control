Description: Quake-style colour formatting for Unix terminals
 Go package colour provides Quake-style colour formatting
 for Unix terminals.
 .
 The package level functions can be used to write to stdout (or strings
 or other files).  If stdout is not a terminal, colour formatting will
 be stripped.
 .
 Example:
     colour.Printf("^0black ^1red ^2green ^3yellow ^4blue ^5magenta ^6cyan
                    ^7white^R\n")
 .
 For more control, a Printer object can be created with various helper
 functions. This can be used to do useful things such as strip formatting,
 write to strings, and so on.
