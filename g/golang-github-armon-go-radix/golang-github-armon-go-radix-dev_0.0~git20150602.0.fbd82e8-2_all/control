Description: Golang implementation of Radix trees
 Provides the radix package that implements a radix tree. The package only
 provides a single Tree implementation, optimized for sparse nodes.
 .
 As a radix tree, it provides the following:
 .
  - O(k) operations. In many cases, this can be faster than a hash table since
    the hash function is an O(k) operation, and hash tables have very poor cache
    locality.
  - Minimum / Maximum value lookups
  - Ordered iteration
 .
 For an immutable variant, see go-immutable-radix.
 .
 This package contains the source.
