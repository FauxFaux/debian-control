Description: Golang helpers for reading password input without cgo
 This package provides cross-platform Go helpers for taking user input
 from the terminal while not echoing the input back (similar to getpasswd).
 The package uses syscalls to avoid any dependence on cgo, and is therefore
 compatible with cross-compiling.
