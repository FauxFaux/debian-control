Description: Sinatra style pattern muxer for Go's net/http library
 PatternServeMux is an HTTP request multiplexer. It matches the URL of each
 incoming request against a list of registered patterns with their associated
 methods and calls the handler for the pattern that most closely matches the
 URL.
