Description: lightweight high performance HTTP request router
 HttpRouter is a lightweight high performance HTTP request router (also
 called multiplexer or just mux for short) for Go.
 .
 In contrast to the default mux Go's net/http package, this router
 supports variables in the routing pattern and matches against the
 request method. It also scales better.
