Description: HTTP/2 support for Go
 This is a work-in-progress HTTP/2 implementation for Go.
 .
 It will eventually live in the Go standard library and won't require
 any changes to your code to use.  It will just be automatic.
 .
 Status:
 .
  * The server support is pretty good. A few things are missing
    but are being worked on.
  * The client work has just started but shares a lot of code
    is coming along much quicker.
