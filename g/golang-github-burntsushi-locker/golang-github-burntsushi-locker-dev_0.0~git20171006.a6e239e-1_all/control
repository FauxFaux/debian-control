Description: simple Go package for conveniently using named read/write locks
 Package locker is a simple Go package to manage named ReadWrite mutexes.
 These appear to be especially useful for synchronizing access
 to session based information in web applications.
 .
 The common use case is to use the package level functions, which use
 a package level set of locks (safe to use from multiple goroutines
 simultaneously).  However, you may also create a new separate set
 of locks.
 .
 All locks are implemented with read-write mutexes. To use them
 like a regular mutex, simply ignore the RLock/RUnlock functions.
