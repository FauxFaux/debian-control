Description: Software-based two-man rule style encryption and decryption server
 Red October is a software-based two-man rule style encryption and
 decryption server.  The two-man rule is a control mechanism designed
 to achieve a high level of security by requiring the presence of two
 authorized people at all times. In the case of Red October the
 two-man rule is implemented by encrypting data in such as way as to
 require two authorised key-holds to decrypt it.
 .
 This package contains the server and command-line client.
