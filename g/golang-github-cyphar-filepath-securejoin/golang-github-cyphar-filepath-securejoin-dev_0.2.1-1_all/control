Description: filepath.SecureJoin implementation
 An implementation of SecureJoin, a candidate for inclusion in the Go
 standard library (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20126). The purpose
 of this function is to be a "secure" alternative to filepath.Join, and in
 particular it provides certain guarantees that are not provided by
 filepath.Join.
