Description: highly efficient bloom filter implementation for Go, CLI tool
 Bloom is a simple library that provides a very efficient implementation of
 Bloom filters for the Go language. This package provides a command line tool
 that can be used to easily create Bloom filters with desired capacity and
 false positive probability. Values can be added to filters through standard
 input, which makes it easy to use the tool in a pipeline workflow.
