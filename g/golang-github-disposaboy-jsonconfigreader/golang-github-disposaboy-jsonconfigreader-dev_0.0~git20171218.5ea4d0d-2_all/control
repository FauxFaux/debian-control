Description: proxy for golang's io.Reader allowing you to use json as a config format
 JsonConfigReader is a proxy for golang's io.Reader that strips line
 comments and trailing commas, allowing you to use json as a reasonable
 config format. Comments start with // and continue to the end of the
 line. Multiline comments are also supported with /* and */. If a
 trailing comma is in front of ] or } it will be stripped as well.
