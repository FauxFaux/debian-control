Description: Regex engine for Go based on the .NET engine
 Feature-rich regular expression engine for Go ported from the .NET
 framework's System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex engine. It does not
 have constant time guarantees like the built-in regexp package, but it
 allows backtracking and is compatible with Perl5 and .NET.
