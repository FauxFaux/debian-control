Description: client and server components compatible with the Docker engine
 Engine-api is a set of Go libraries to implement client and server
 components compatible with the Docker engine.
 The client package implements a fully featured http client to interact
 with the Docker engine. It's modeled after the requirements of the Docker
 engine CLI, but it can also serve other purposes.
 .
 Please do not use this library anymore. The Docker API client and types
 have been moved to the main docker repo under the following import paths:
