Description: Provides an atomically written/replaced file
 Package atomicfile provides the ability to write a file with an eventual
 rename on Close (using os.Rename). This allows for a file to always be
 in a consistent state and never represent an in-progress write.
 .
 NOTE: `os.Rename` may not be atomic on your operating system.
