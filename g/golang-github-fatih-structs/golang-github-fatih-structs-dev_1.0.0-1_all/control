Description: Utilities for Go structs
 Structs contains various utilities
 to work with Go (Golang) structs. It was initially used to convert
 a struct into a map[string]interface{}. With time we've added other
 utilities for structs.  It's basically a high level package based on
 primitives from the reflect package.
