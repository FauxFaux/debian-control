Description: netrc file parser for Go programming language
 A netrc file usually resides in $HOME/.netrc and is traditionally used
 by the ftp(1) program to look up login information (username, password,
 etc.) of remote system(s). The file format is (loosely) described in
 this man page: http://linux.die.net/man/5/netrc .
 .
 Other programs have now adopted this file format for storing credentials.
 .
 This is a Go library for parsing netrc(5) files.
