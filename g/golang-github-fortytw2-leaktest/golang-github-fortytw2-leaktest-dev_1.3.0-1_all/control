Description: Goroutine Leak Detector
 Refactored, tested variant of the goroutine leak detector found in both
 net/http tests and the cockroachdb source tree.
 .
 Takes a snapshot of running goroutines at the start of a test, and at the
 end -- compares the two and voila. Ignores runtime/sys goroutines.
