Description: Go package providing type- and concurrency-safe incremental counters
 This Go package provides access to atomic integers that can be
 tested, incremented and set in a type- and concurrency-safe manner.
 Objects are protected by a mutex and available for all signed and
 unsigned integer types in Go.
