Description: Go package for embedding web resources into Go executables
 go.rice is a Golang package that makes working with resources such as

 go.rice will load required files directly from disk. Upon deployment
 it is easy to add all resource files to a executable using the rice
 tool, without changing the source code for your package. Several
 methods are provided for adding resources to your binary by go.rice.
