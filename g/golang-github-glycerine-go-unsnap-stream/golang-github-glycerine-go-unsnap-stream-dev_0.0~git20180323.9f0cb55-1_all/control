Description: library for decoding the snappy streaming format
 Package unsnap is a small golang library for decoding and encoding
 the snappy streaming format, specified here:
 https://github.com/google/snappy/blob/master/framing_format.txt
 .
 Note that the streaming or framing format for snappy is different from
 snappy itself. Think of it as a train of boxcars: the streaming format
 breaks your data in chunks, applies snappy to each chunk alone, then
 puts a thin wrapper around the chunk, and sends it along in turn. You
 can begin decoding before receiving everything. And memory requirements
 for decoding are sane.
