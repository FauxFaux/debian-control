Description: errors with stacktraces for go
 Package errors adds stacktrace support to errors in go.
 .
 This is particularly useful when you want to understand the state of
 execution when an error was returned unexpectedly.
 .
 It provides the type *Error which implements the standard golang error
 interface, so you can use this library interchangeably with code that is
 expecting a normal error return.
