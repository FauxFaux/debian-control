   * automatic and safe type conversion between Cassandra and Go without any
     loss of precision
   * synchronous API with an asynchronous and concurrent back-end
   * result paging
   * atomic batch execution
   * query tracing to obtain a detailed output of all events that happened
      during the query execution
   * frame compression
   * support of multiple Cassandra versions
