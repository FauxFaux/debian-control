Description: BTree implementation for Go
 This package provides an in-memory B-Tree implementation for Go, useful
 as an ordered, mutable data structure.
 .
 The API is based off of the wonderful
 http://godoc.org/github.com/petar/GoLLRB/llrb, and is meant to allow
 btree to act as a drop-in replacement for gollrb trees.
