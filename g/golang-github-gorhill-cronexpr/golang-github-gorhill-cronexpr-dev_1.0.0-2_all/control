Description: cron expression parser
 Given a cron expression and a time stamp, you can get the next time
 stamp which satisfies the cron expression.
 .
 The time-matching algorithm in this implementation is efficient, it
 avoids as much as possible to guess the next matching time stamp, a
 common technique seen in a number of implementations out there.
