Description: golang foundation for RPC over HTTP services
 gorilla/rpc is a foundation for RPC over HTTP services, providing access to
 the exported methods of an object through HTTP requests.  It derives from the
 standard net/rpc package but uses a single HTTP request per call instead of
 persistent connections. Other differences compared to net/rpc:
  - Multiple codecs can be registered in the same server.
  - A codec is chosen based on the "Content-Type" header from the request.
  - Service methods also receive http.Request as parameter.
  - This package can be used on Google App Engine.
