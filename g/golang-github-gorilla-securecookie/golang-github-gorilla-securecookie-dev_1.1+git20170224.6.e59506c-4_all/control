Description: provides authenticated and encrypted cookie values
 This package provides methods for encoding and decoding authenticated
 cookie values for Go web applications. These values optionally be
 encrypted.
 .
 Secure cookies are protected from forgery because their values are
 validated using HMAC. When encrypted, the content is also kept private.
 .
 It is still recommended that sensitive data not be stored in cookies,
 and that HTTPS be used to prevent cookie replay attacks.
