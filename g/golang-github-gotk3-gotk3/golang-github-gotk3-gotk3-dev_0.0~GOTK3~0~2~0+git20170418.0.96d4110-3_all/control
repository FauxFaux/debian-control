Description: Go bindings for GTK3
 The gotk3 project provides Go bindings for GTK+3 and dependent projects.
 Each component is given its own subdirectory, which is used as the
 import path for the package.
 .
 Partial binding support for the following libraries is currently implemented:
 .
   - GTK+3 (3.12 and later)
   - GDK 3 (3.12 and later)
   - GLib 2 (2.36 and later)
   - Cairo (1.10 and later)
 .
 Care has been taken for memory management to work seamlessly with Go's
 garbage collector without the need to use or understand GObject's floating
 references.
