Description: copy & paste-friendly golang crypto
 This library demonstrates a suite of basic cryptography from the Go standard
 library. To the extent possible, it tries to hide complexity and help one
 avoid common mistakes. The recommendations were chosen as a compromise between
 cryptographic qualities, the Go standard lib, and the author's existing use
 cases.
