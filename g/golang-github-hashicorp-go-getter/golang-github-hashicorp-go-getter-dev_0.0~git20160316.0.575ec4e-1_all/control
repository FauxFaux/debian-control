Description: download from a URL using a variety of protocols
 Go-getter is a library for Golang to download files or directories from
 various sources using a URL as the primary form of input.
 .
 The power of this library is being flexible in being able to download from
 a number of different sources (file paths, Git, HTTP, Mercurial, etc.)
 using a single string as input. This removes the burden of knowing how
 to download from a variety of sources from the implementer.
