Description: in-memory database built on immutable radix trees
 Implementation of a simple in-memory database built on immutable radix
 trees. The database provides Atomicity, Consistency and Isolation from
 ACID. Being that it is in-memory, it does not provide durability. The
 database is instantiated with a schema that specifies the tables and
 indicies that exist and allows transactions to be executed.
