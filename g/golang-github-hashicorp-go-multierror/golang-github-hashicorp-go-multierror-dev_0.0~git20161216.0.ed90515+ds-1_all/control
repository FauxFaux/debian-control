Description: Go package for representing a list of errors as a single error
 go-multierror is a package for Go that provides a mechanism for representing a
 list of error values as a single error.
 .
 This allows a function in Go to return an error that might actually be a list
 of errors. If the caller knows this, they can unwrap the list and access the
 errors. If the caller doesn't know, the error formats to a nice human-readable
 format.
 .
 go-multierror implements the errwrap interface so that it can be used with that
 library, as well.
 .
 This package contains the source.
