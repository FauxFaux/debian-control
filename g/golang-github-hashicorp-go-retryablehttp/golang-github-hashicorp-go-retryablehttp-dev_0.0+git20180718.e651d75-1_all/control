Description: retryable HTTP client in Go
 This package provides a familiar HTTP client interface with
 automatic retries and exponential backoff. It is a thin wrapper over
 the standard net/http client library and exposes nearly the same public
 API. This makes retryablehttp very easy to drop into existing programs.
