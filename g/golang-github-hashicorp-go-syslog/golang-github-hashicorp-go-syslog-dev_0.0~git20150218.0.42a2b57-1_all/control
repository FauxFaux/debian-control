Description: Golang syslog wrapper, cross-compile friendly
 This package provides a very simple gsyslog package. The point of this package
 is to allow safe importing of syslog without introducing cross-compilation
 issues. The stdlib log/syslog cannot be imported on Windows systems, and
 without conditional compilation this adds complications.
 .
 Instead, gsyslog provides a very simple wrapper around log/syslog but returns a
 runtime error if attempting to initialize on a non Linux or OSX system.
 .
 This package contains the source.
