Description: Go implementation of HashiCorp Configuration Language
 HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) is a configuration language built by
 HashiCorp. The goal of HCL is to build a structured configuration language that
 is both human and machine friendly for use with command-line tools, but
 specifically targeted towards DevOps tools, servers, etc.
 .
 HCL is also fully JSON compatible. That is, JSON can be used as completely
 valid input to a system expecting HCL. This helps makes systems interoperable
 with other systems.
 .
 HCL is heavily inspired by libucl, nginx configuration, and others similar.
 .
 This package contains the source.
