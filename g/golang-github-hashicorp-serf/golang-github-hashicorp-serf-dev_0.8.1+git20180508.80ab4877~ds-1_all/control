Description: Service orchestration and management tool (source)
 Serf is a decentralized solution for service discovery and orchestration that
 is lightweight, highly available, and fault tolerant.
 .
 Serf runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. An efficient and lightweight gossip
 protocol is used to communicate with other nodes. Serf can detect node failures
 and notify the rest of the cluster. An event system is built on top of Serf,
 letting you use Serf's gossip protocol to propagate events such as deploys,
 configuration changes, etc. Serf is completely masterless with no single point
 of failure.
 .
 This package contains the source.
