Description: Golang connection multiplexing library
 Yamux (Yet another Multiplexer) is a multiplexing library for Golang. It relies
 on an underlying connection to provide reliability and ordering, such as TCP or
 Unix domain sockets, and provides stream-oriented multiplexing. It is inspired
 by SPDY but is not interoperable with it.
 .
 Yamux features include:
 .
   - Bi-directional streams
     - Streams can be opened by either client or server
     - Useful for NAT traversal
     - Server-side push support
   - Flow control
     - Avoid starvation
     - Back-pressure to prevent overwhelming a receiver
   - Keep Alives
     - Enables persistent connections over a load balancer
   - Efficient
     - Enables thousands of logical streams with low overhead
 .
