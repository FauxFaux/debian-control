Description: Go build information utilities
 This package provides small build information utilities for tracking Go binary
 version information. Rather than trying to assign a linear version number to
 a binary, the tag names and version control commit hashes of all dependencies
 are tracked. This information is embedded into the binary at build time.
 .
 The package is a build dependency of acmetool.
