Description: Reader and writer for Python's pickle format in Golang
 Stalecucumber reads and writes pickled data. The format is
 the same as the Python "pickle" module.
 .
 Protocols 0,1,2 are implemented. These are the versions written by the
 Python 2.x series. Python 3 defines newer protocol versions, but can
 write the older protocol versions so they are readable by this package.
