Description: structured, composable logging for Go
 package log15 provides an opinionated, simple toolkit for
 best-practice logging in Go (golang) that is both human
 and machine readable. It is modeled after the Go standard
 library's io and net/http packages and is an alternative
 to the standard library's log package.
