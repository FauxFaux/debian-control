Description: Go library to detect starting from Windows Explorer
 mousetrap is a tiny Go library that answers a single question:
 On a Windows machine, was the process invoked by someone double clicking
 on the executable file while browsing in Explorer?
 .
 Motivation: Windows users unfamiliar with command line tools will
 often "double-click" the executable for a tool. Because most CLI tools
 print the help and then exit when invoked without arguments, this is
 often very frustrating for those users.
 .
 mousetrap provides a way to detect these invocations so
 that you can provide more helpful behavior and instructions
 on how to run the CLI tool.
