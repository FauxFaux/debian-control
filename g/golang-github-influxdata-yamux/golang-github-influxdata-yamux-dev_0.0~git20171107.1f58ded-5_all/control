Description: Golang connection multiplexing library
 Yamux (Yet another Multiplexer) is a multiplexing library for Golang.
 It relies on an underlying connection to provide reliability and
 ordering, such as TCP or Unix domain sockets, and provides stream-oriented
 multiplexing. It is inspired by SPDY but is not interoperable with it.
