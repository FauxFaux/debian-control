Description: code that supplements the Go stdlib sync package
 This package contains code that supplements the sync package from the Go
 standard library. In particular:
 .
  * Bundle, which makes it easy to write code that spawns multiple
    cancellation-aware workers that may fail.
  * InvariantMutex, which makes it possible to automatically check your
    invariants at lock and unlock time.
