Description: General purpose extensions to Golang's database/sql library
 sqlx is a library which provides a set of extensions on Go's standard
 database/sql library. The sqlx versions of sql.DB, sql.TX, sql.Stmt,
 et al. all leave the underlying interfaces untouched, so that their
 interfaces are a superset on the standard ones.  This makes it relatively
 painless to integrate existing codebases using database/sql with sqlx.
 .
 Major additional concepts are:
 .
   * Marshal rows into structs (with embedded struct support), maps, and slices
   * Named parameter support including prepared statements
   * Get and Select to go quickly from query to struct/slice
