Description: named machine level mutex shareable between processes
 package mutex provides a named machine level mutex shareable between
 processes.
 .
 Mutexes have names. Each each name, only one mutex for that name can be
 acquired at the same time, within and across process boundaries. If a
 process dies while the mutex is held, the mutex is automatically released.
