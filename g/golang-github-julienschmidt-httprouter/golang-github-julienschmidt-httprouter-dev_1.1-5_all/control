Description: High performance HTTP request router for Go that scales well
 HttpRouter (github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter) is a lightweight high
 performance HTTP request router (also called multiplexer or just mux for
 short) for Go.
 .
 In contrast to the default mux of Go's net/http package, this router supports
 variables in the routing pattern and matches against the request method. It
 also scales better.
 .
 The router is optimized for high performance and a small memory footprint. It
 scales well even with very long paths and a large number of routes. A
 compressing dynamic trie (radix tree) structure is used for efficient
 matching.
