Description: Painless middleware chaining for Go
 Alice provides a convenient way to chain HTTP middleware functions and
 the app handler.
 .
 It transforms:
   go Middleware1(Middleware2(Middleware3(App)))
 to
   go alice.New(Middleware1, Middleware2, Middleware3).Then(App)
 .
 None of the other middleware chaining solutions behaves exactly
 like Alice. Alice is as minimal as it gets: in essence, it's just a
 for loop that does the wrapping for you.
