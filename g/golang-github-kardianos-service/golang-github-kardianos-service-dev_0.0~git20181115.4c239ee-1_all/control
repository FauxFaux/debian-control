Description: Run go programs as a service on major platforms.
 service GoDoc (https://godoc.org/github.com/kardianos/service) service
 will install / un-install, start / stop, and run a program as a service

 used to detect how a program is called, from an interactive terminal or
 from a service manager.  BUGS• Dependencies field is not implemented
 for Linux systems and Launchd.• OS X when running as a UserService
 Interactive will not be accurate.
