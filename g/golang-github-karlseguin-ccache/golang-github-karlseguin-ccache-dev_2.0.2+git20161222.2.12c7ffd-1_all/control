Description: Golang LRU Cache for high concurrency
 CCache is an LRU Cache, written in Go, focused on supporting high
 concurrency. Lock contention on the list is reduced by introducing a
 window which limits the frequency that an item can get promoted,
 using a buffered channel to queue promotions for a single worker, and
 garbage collecting within the same thread as the worker.
