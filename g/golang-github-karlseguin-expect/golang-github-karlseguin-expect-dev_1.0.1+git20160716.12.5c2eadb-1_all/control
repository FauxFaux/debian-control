Description: Testing framework for Go with more concise syntax
 Expect is a testing framework for Go to help write shorter
 tests. Go's built-in testing package is fine, except it tends to lead
 to verbose code. Expect runs within the go test framework but
 provides a different, concise syntax for specifying expectations.
