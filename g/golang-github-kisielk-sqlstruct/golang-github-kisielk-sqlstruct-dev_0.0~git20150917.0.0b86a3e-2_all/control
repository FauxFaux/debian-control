Description: convenience functions for using structs with the database/sql package
 Package sqlstruct provides some convenience functions for using structs with
 the Go standard library's database/sql package.
 .
 The package matches struct field names to SQL query column names. A field can
 also specify a matching column with "sql" tag, if it's different from field
 name.  Unexported fields or fields marked with `sql:"-"` are ignored, just like
 with "encoding/json" package.
