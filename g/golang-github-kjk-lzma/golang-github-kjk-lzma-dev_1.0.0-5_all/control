Description: port of the lzma compression algorithm
 This package is a port of the lzma compression algorithm
 from to Go.
 .
 Only the lzma v1 compression algorithm is supported; the
 newer lzma v2 from LZMA SDK v9.xx came after this library
 was released.
 .
 The archiving formats 7z, xz (and others that use lzma
 internally) are also different beasts.
