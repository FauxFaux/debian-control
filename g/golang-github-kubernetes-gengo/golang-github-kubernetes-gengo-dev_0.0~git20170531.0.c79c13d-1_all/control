Description: Library for generating code based on Go files
 The gengo library implements a code generation system for Go files
 used by Kubernetes. It is more than a dumb template library and is
 informed by the Go language's syntax, type and naming conventions
 when generating code.
 .
 The gengo library can build code using the following generators:
 .
   * set
   * deep-copy
   * defaulter
   * go-to-protobuf
 .
 Gengo was first used in Kubernetes and is split out into a separate
 library for ease of reuse and maintainability.
