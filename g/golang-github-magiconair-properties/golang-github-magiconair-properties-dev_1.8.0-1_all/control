Description: Java properties scanner for Go
 “properties” is a Go library for reading and writing properties files.
 .
 It supports reading from multiple files and Spring style recursive
 property expansion of expressions like ${key} to their corresponding
 value.  Value expressions can refer to other keys like in ${key} or
 to environment variables like in ${USER}.  Filenames can also contain
 environment variables like in /home/${USER}/myapp.properties.
 .
 Comments and the order of keys are preserved. Comments can be modified
 and can be written to the output.
 .
 The properties library supports both ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8 encoded data.
