Description: implementation of a few basic data structures
 Inspired by .NET's Linq, querying data structures used in this library
 is a snap! Build Go pipelines quickly and easily which will apply lambdas
 as they query your data structures. Converting between slices and a
 queryable structure is as trivial as it should be.
