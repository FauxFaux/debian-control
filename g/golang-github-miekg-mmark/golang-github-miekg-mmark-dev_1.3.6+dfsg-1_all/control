Description: Markdown processor in Go geared for the IETF (Go library)
 Write RFCs using markdown.  Mmark (written in Go) provides an advanced
 markdown dialect that processes a single file to produce internet-drafts
 in XML format.  Internet-drafts written in mmark can produce XML2RFC
 v2 and XML2RFC v3 output.
 .
 Mmark is a fork of blackfriday which is a Markdown processor implemented
 in Go.  It supports a number of extensions, inspired by Leanpub, kramdown
 and Asciidoc, that allows for large documents to be written.  It is
 specifically designed to write Internet Drafts (I-Ds) and RFCs for the IETF.
 With mmark you can create a single file that serves as input into the
 XML2RFC processor.
 .
 It can currently output HTML5, XML2RFC v2 and XML2RFC v3 XML.
 Other output engines could be added.
 .
 This package provides the mmark Go library for development.
