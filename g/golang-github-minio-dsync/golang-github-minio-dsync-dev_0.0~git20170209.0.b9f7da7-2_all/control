Description: Distributed sync package for Go
 dsync is a package for doing distributed locks over a network of n nodes.
 It is designed with simplicity in mind and hence offers limited
 scalability (n <= 16). Each node will be connected to all other nodes and
 lock requests from any node will be broadcast to all connected nodes.
