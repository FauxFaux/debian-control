Description: implementation of SHA256 using SIMD instructions for Intel and ARM
 sha256-simd accelerate SHA256 computations in pure Go for both Intel
 (AVX2, AVX, SSE) as well as ARM (arm64) platforms.  Introduction This
 package is designed as a drop-in replacement for crypto/sha256. For Intel
 CPUs it has three flavors for AVX2, AVX and SSE whereby the fastest
 method is automatically chosen depending on CPU capabilities. For ARM
 CPUs with the Cryptography Extensions advantage is taken of the SHA2
 instructions resulting in a massive performance improvement.
 .
 This package uses Golang assembly and as such does not depend on cgo. The
 Intel versions are based on the implementations as described in "Fast
 SHA-256 Implementations on Intel Architecture Processors" by J. Guilford
 et al.  Performance Below is the speed in MB/s for a single core (ranked
 fast to slow) as well as the factor of improvement over crypto/sha256
 (when applicable).
