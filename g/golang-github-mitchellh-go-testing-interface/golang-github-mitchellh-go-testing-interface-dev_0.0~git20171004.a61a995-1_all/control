Description: library to expose *testing.T as an interface
 Go library that exports an interface that *testing.T implements as well as
 a runtime version you can use in its place.
 .
 The purpose of this library is so export test helpers as a public API
 without depending on the "testing" package, since one can't create a
 *testing.T struct manually.
