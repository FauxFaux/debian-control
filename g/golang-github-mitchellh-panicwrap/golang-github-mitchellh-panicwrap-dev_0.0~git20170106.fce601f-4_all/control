Description: library for catching and handling panics in Go applications
 panicwrap is a Go library that re-executes a Go binary and monitors
 stderr output from the binary for a panic. When it finds a panic, it
 executes a user-defined handler function. Stdout, stderr, stdin, signals,
 and exit codes continue to work as normal, making the existence of
 panicwrap mostly invisible to the end user until a panic actually occurs.
