Description: Go HTTP client with timeouts
 This Go package provides an HTTP Transport that implements the RoundTripper
 interface and can be used as a built in replacement for the standard
 library's, providing:
 .
  * connection timeouts
  * request timeouts
 .
 This is a thin wrapper around http.Transport that sets dial timeouts and uses
 Go's internal timer scheduler to call the Go 1.1+ CancelRequest() API.
