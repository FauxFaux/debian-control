Description: Go package for writing logs to rolling files
 Lumberjack is intended to be one part of a logging infrastructure.
 It is not an all-in-one solution, but instead is a pluggable component
 at the bottom of the logging stack that simply controls the files
 to which logs are written.
 .
 Lumberjack plays well with any logging package that can write to
 an io.Writer, including the standard library's log package.
 .
 Lumberjack assumes that only one process is writing to the output
 files. Using the same lumberjack configuration from multiple processes
 on the same machine will result in improper behavior.
