Description: Human readable entropy.
 This Go library converts byte slices into human-friendly phrases.
 .
 The primary purpose is to assist with the generation of
 cryptographically secure passwords. The threshold for a cryptographically
 secure password is between 128 and 256 bits, which when converted to
 base64 is 22-43 random characters. Random characters are both difficult to
 remember and subject to error when spoken or written down; slurring or
 sloppy handwriting can make it difficult to recover a password.
