Description: Golang AMQP mocking library
 AMQP is a verbose protocol that makes it difficult to implement proper
 unit-testing on your application.  The first goal of the Wabbit library is
 provide a sane interface for an AMQP client implementation based on
 the specification AMQP-0-9-1 (no extension) and then an implementation
 of this interface using the well established package streadway/amqp
 (https://github.com/streadway/amqp) (a wrapper).
