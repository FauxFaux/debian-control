Description: pure Go implementation of termbox library
 Termbox is a library that provides a minimalistic API which allows
 the programmer to write text-based user interfaces.
 .
 The basic idea is an abstraction of the greatest common subset of
 features available on all major terminals and other terminal-like
 APIs in a minimalistic fashion. Small API means it is easy to
 implement, test, maintain and learn it, that's what makes the termbox
 a distinct library in its area.
