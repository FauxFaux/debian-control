Description: Go library for the TOML language -- commandline programs
 This library supports TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language)
 version v1.0.0.
 .
 TOML aims to be a minimal configuration file format that's
 easy to read due to obvious semantics. TOML is designed
 to map unambiguously to a hash table. TOML should be
 easy to parse into data structures in a wide variety
 of languages.
 .
 This package contains the two commandline programs tomll
 and tomljson.
