Description: LLRB implementation of balanced binary search trees for Go
 GoLLRB is a Left-Leaning Red-Black (LLRB) implementation of 2-3 balanced
 binary search trees in Go the Language.
 .
 2-3 trees (a type of BBST's), as well as the runtime-similar 2-3-4 trees,
 are the de facto standard BBST algorithms found in implementations of
 Python, Java, and other libraries. The LLRB method of implementing 2-3
 trees is a recent improvement over the traditional implementation. The
 LLRB approach was discovered relatively recently (in 2008) by Robert
 Sedgewick of Princeton University.
