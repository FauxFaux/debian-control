Description: disk-backed key-value store
 Diskv (disk-vee) is a simple, persistent key-value store written in the Go
 language. It starts with an incredibly simple API for storing arbitrary
 data on a filesystem by key, and builds several layers of
 performance-enhancing abstraction on top. The end result is a conceptually
 simple, but highly performant, disk-backed storage system.
