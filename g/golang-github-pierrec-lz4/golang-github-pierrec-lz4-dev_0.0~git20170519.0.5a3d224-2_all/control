Description: LZ4 compression and decompression in pure Go
 This library implements reading and writing lz4 compressed data (a frame),
 as specified in
 http://fastcompression.blogspot.fr/2013/04/lz4-streaming-format-final.html,
 using an io.Reader (decompression) and io.Writer (compression).  It is
 designed to minimize memory usage while maximizing throughput by being
 able to [de]compress data concurrently.
