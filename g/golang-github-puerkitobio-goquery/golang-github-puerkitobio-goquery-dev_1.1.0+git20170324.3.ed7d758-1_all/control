Description: jQuery-style HTML manipulation in Go
 goquery brings a syntax and a set of features similar to jQuery
 (http://jquery.com/) to the Go language, based on Go's net/html
 package and the CSS Selector library cascadia.
 .
 Syntax-wise, it is as close as possible to jQuery, with the same
 function names when possible, and a chainable interface.
