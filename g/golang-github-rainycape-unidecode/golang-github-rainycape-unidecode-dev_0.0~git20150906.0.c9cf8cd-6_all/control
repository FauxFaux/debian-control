Description: replace non-ASCII characters with their ASCII approximations
 Package unidecode implements a unicode transliterator which replaces
 non-ASCII characters with their ASCII approximations. Given an
 unicode encoded string, the primary function, Unidecode, returns
 another string with non-ASCII characters replaced with their closest
 ASCII counterparts.
