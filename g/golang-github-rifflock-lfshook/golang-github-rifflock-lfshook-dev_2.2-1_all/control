Description: local filesystem hook for logrus (Go library)
 Local Filesystem Hook for Logrus Sometimes developers like to write
 directly to a file on the filesystem. This is a hook for logrus
 (https://github.com/Sirupsen/logrus) designed to allow users to do
 just that. The log levels are dynamic at instantiation of the hook,
 so it is capable of logging at some or all levels.
