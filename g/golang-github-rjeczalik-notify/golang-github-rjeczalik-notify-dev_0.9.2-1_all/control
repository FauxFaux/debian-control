Description: file system event notification library on steroids
 Notify is a Go high-level abstraction over filesystem watchers like
 inotify, kqueue, FSEvents, FEN or ReadDirectoryChangesW. On top of filesystem
 watchers notify maintains a watchpoint tree, which provides strategy for
 creating and closing filesystem watches and dispatching filesystem events to
 user channels.
