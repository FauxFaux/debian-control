Description: fast generation of 192-bit UUIDs
 Package fastuuid provides fast UUID generation of 192 bit universally
 unique identifiers. It does not provide formatting or parsing of
 the identifiers (it is assumed that a simple hexadecimal or base64
 representation is sufficient, for which adequate functionality exists
 elsewhere).
