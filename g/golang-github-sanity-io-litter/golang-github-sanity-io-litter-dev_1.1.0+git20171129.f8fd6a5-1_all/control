Description: Pretty printer library for Go data structures to aid in debugging and testing
 Litter is a pretty printer library for Go data structures to aid in
 debugging and testing.
 .
 It's named for the fact that it outputs literals, which you litter
 your output with. As a side benefit, all Litter output is compilable
 Go. You can use Litter to emit data during debug, and it's also really
 nice for "snapshot data" in unit tests, since it produces consistent,
 sorted output.
 .
 Litter was inspired by Spew (https://github.com/davecgh/go-spew), but
 focuses on terseness and readability.
