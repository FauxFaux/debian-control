Description: ifplugd-powered network link status notification for Go
 ifplugo delivers network interface link information and link
 changes. It does this (on Linux) by using code from ifplugd
 (http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/ifplugd/) to gather the necessary
 status information, then emits a status summary on a given channel. This
 summary (LinkStatusSample) is emitted on the first invocation and each
 time the state changes for at least one monitored interface.
