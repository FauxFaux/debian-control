Description: Redis client implementation in Go
 This library provides a Redis client implementation in the Go language.
 This can be used to communicate with Redis servers and server clusters.
 .
 Redis is a key-value database in a similar vein to memcache but the dataset
 is non-volatile. Redis additionally provides native support for atomically
 manipulating and querying data structures such as lists and sets.
