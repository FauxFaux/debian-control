Description: library to open an URI in the user's preferred application
 This library provides a set of Go functions allowing to "open" a
 file, directory or URI using the user's preferred application (or an
 operating system-wide default) to handle objects of those particular
 types. Optionally, it's possible to directly specify the
 application to use for opening the resource.
