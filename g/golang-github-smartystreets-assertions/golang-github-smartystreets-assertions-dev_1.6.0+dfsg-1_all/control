Description: fluent assertion-style functions
 This package contains the implementations for all assertions which are
 referenced in goconvey package (github.com/smartystreets/goconvey/convey)
 and gunit (github.com/smartystreets/gunit) for use with the So(...)
 method. They can also be used in traditional Go test functions and even in
 applications.
