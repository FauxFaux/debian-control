Description: xUnit-style test fixture adapter for go test
 Yet another testing tool for Go.
 .
 It's a mix of good things provided by the built-in testing package, the
 assertions (https://github.com/smartystreets/assertions) you know
 and love from the GoConvey (http://goconvey.co) project, the xUnit
 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit) testing style (the first real unit
 testing framework), and it's all glued together with go test.
