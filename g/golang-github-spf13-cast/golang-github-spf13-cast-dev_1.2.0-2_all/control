Description: Safe and easy casting from one type to another in Go
 Cast is a library to convert between different Go types in a consistent
 and easy way.
 .
 Cast provides simple functions to easily convert a number to a string, an
 interface into a bool, etc.  Cast does this intelligently when an obvious
 conversion is possible.  It doesn’t make any attempts to guess what you
 meant; for example, you can only convert a string to an int when it is a
 string representation of an int such as “8”.
 .
 Cast was developed for use in Hugo (http://gohugo.io/), a website engine
 which uses YAML, TOML or JSON for meta data.
