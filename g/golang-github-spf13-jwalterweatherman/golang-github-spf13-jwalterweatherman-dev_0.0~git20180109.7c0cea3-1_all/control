Description: Go library for both printing to the terminal and logging to files
 jWalterWeatherman provides seamless printing to the terminal (stdout)
 and logging to a io.Writer (file) that's as easy to use as fmt.Println.
 .
 JWW is primarily a wrapper around the excellent Go standard log library.
 It provides a few advantages over using the standard log library alone:
 .
  * One library for both printing to the terminal and logging (to files).
  * Allow the user to easily control what levels are printed and logged
  * No unnecessary initialization cruft.  Just use it.
