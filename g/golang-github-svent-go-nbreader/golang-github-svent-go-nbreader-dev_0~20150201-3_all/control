Description: non-blocking io.Reader for go
 go-nbreader provides a non-blocking io.Reader for go (golang). It
 allows one to specify two timeouts:
 .
  * Timeout: Read() returns after the specified timeout, even if no data
    has been read.
 .
  * ChunkTimeout: Read() returns if no data has been read for the
    specified time, even if the overall timeout has not been hit yet.
    ChunkTimeout must be smaller than Timeout.
 .
 When the internal buffer contains at least blockSize bytes, Read()
 returns regardless of the specified timeouts.
