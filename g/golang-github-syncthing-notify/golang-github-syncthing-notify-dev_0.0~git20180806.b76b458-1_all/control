Description: File system event notification library on steroids
 Package notify implements access to filesystem events.
 .
 Notify is a high-level abstraction over filesystem watchers
 like inotify, kqueue, FSEvents, FEN or ReadDirectoryChangesW.
 Watcher implementations are split into two groups: ones that
 natively support recursive notifications (FSEvents and
 ReadDirectoryChangesW) and ones that do not (inotify, kqueue,
 FEN).
 .
 This is a fork by the Syncthing project.
