Description: Go package for ideal tty prompt
 go-input is a Go package for reading user input in console.
 .
 Here is the some good points compared with other/similar packages. It
 can handle SIGINT (Ctrl+C) while reading input and returns error. It
 allows one to change IO interface as io.Writer and io.Reader so it's
 easy to test of your go program with this package (This package is also
 well-tested!). It also supports raw mode input (reading input without
 prompting) for multiple platform (Darwin, Linux and Windows). Not only
 this it allows one to prompt complex input via Option struct.
