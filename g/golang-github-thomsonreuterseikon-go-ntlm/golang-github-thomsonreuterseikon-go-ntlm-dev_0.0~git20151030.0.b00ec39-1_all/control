Description: NTLM Implementation for Go
 This is a native implementation of NTLM for Go
 that was implemented using the Microsoft MS-NLMP documentation available
 at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc236621.aspx.  The library
 is currently in use and has been tested with connectionless NTLMv1 and
 v2 with and without extended session security.
