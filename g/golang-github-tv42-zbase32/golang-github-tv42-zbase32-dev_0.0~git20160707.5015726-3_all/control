Description: Human-oriented encoding for binary data
 zbase32 implements the z-base-32 encoding as specified in
 http://philzimmermann.com/docs/human-oriented-base-32-encoding.txt
 .
 This package has been extensively tested to match the behavior of the
 zbase32 Python package (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zbase32/).
 .
 Note that this is not RFC 4648/3548, for that see encoding/base32
 (http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/base32/). z-base-32 is a variant that
 aims to be more human-friendly, and in some circumstances shorter.
