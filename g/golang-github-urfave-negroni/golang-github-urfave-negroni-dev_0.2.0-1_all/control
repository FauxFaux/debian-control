Description: Idiomatic HTTP Middleware for Golang
 Negroni is an idiomatic approach to web middleware in Go. It is tiny,
 non-intrusive, and encourages use of net/http Handlers.
 .
 If you like the idea of Martini (https://github.com/go-martini/martini),
 but you think it contains too much magic, then Negroni is a great fit.
 .
 This is the library formerly known as github.com/codegangsta/negroni (Github
 will automatically redirect requests to it).
