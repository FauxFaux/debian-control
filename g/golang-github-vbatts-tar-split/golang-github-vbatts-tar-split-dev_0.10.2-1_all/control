Description: tar archive assembly/disassembly (source)
 Pristinely disassembling a tar archive, and stashing needed raw bytes and
 offsets to reassemble a validating original archive.
 .
 Eventually this should detect TARs that this is not possible with.
 .
 For example stored sparse files that have "holes" in them, will be read as a
 contiguous file, though the archive contents may be recorded in sparse format.
 Therefore when adding the file payload to a reassembled tar, to achieve
 identical output, the file payload would need be precisely re-sparsified. This
 is not something I seek to fix immediately, but would rather have an alert that
 precise reassembly is not possible. (see more
 http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_node/Sparse-Formats.html)
 .
 Other caveat, while tar archives support having multiple file entries for the
 same path, we will not support this feature. If there are more than one entries
 with the same path, expect an err (like ErrDuplicatePath) or a resulting tar
 stream that does not validate your original checksum/signature.
 .
 Contract: Do not break the API of stdlib archive/tar in our fork (ideally find
 an upstream mergeable solution).
 .
 This package contains the source.
