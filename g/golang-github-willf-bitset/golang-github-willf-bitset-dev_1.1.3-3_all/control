Description: Implements bitsets, a mapping between non-negative integers and boolean values
 This package provides a Go library with methods for setting, clearing,
 flipping, and testing individual integers.
 .
 It also provides set intersection, union, difference, complement, and
 symmetric operations, as well as tests to check whether any, all, or
 no bits are set, and queries a bitset's current length and number of
 positive bits.
