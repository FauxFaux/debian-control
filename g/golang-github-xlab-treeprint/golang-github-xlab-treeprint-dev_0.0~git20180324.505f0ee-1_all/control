Description: simple ASCII tree composing tool
 Package treeprint provides a simple ASCII tree composing tool.
 .
 The utility will yield Unicode-friendly trees. The output is
 predictable and there is no platform-dependent exceptions, so if
 you have issues with displaying the tree in the console, all
 platform-related transformations can be done after the tree has
 been rendered.
