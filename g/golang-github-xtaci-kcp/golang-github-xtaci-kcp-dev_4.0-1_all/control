Description: Full-Featured Reliable-UDP Library for golang
 KCP (golang-github-xtaci-kcp-dev) is a Production-Grade Reliable-UDP
 library for golang. It provides fast, ordered, and error-checked delivery
 of stream over UDP packets.
 .
 It has been well tested with opensource project kcptun, which runs on
 millions of devices, from low-end MIPS routers to high-end servers. It also
 runs well for applications like online games, live broadcasting, file
 synchronization and network acceleration.
 .
 Features:
   * Optimized for Realtime Multiplayer Games, Audio/Video Streaming.
   * Compatible with skywind3000's (https://github.com/skywind3000)
     C version with optimizations.
   * Cache friendly and Memory optimized design in golang.
   * Compatible with net.Conn (https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Conn)
     and net.Listener (https://golang.org/pkg/net/#Listener).
   * FEC (Forward Error Correction)
     (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_error_correction)
     Support with Reed-Solomon Codes
     (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction)
   * Packet level encryption support with AES, TEA, 3DES, Blowfish, Cast5,
     Salsa20, etc., in CFB mode.
   * O(1) goroutines created for the entire server application, minimized
     goroutine context switch.
 .
 Conventions:
   Control messages like SYN/FIN/RST in TCP are not defined in KCP.
   You need some keepalive/heartbeat mechanims in the application-level.
   A real world example is to use some multiplexing protocol over session,
   such as smux (golang-github-xtaci-smux-dev) with embedded keepalive
   mechanism. See kcptun (https://github.com/xtaci/kcptun) for example.
