Description: Simple Multiplexing for golang
 Smux (Simple MUltipleXing) is a multiplexing library for Golang.
 It relies on an underlying connection to provide reliability and ordering,
 such as TCP or KCP (golang-github-xtaci-kcp-dev), and provides
 stream-oriented multiplexing.
 .
 The original intention of this library is to power the connection
 management for KCP (golang-github-xtaci-kcp-dev).
 .
 Features:
   * Tiny, less than 600 LOC.
   * Token bucket controlled receiving, which provides smoother bandwidth
     graph.
   * Session-wide receive buffer, shared among streams, tightly controlled
     overall memory usage.
   * Minimized header(8Bytes), maximized payload.
   * Well-tested on millions of devices in kcptun.
