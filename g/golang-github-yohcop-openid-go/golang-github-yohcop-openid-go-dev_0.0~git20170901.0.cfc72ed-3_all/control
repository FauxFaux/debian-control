Description: OpenID 2.0 implementation in Go
 This package provides an OpenID 2.0 consumer implementation in Go.
 This library aims to have a very simple API that is easy to use.

 OpenID Authentication provides a way to prove that an end user controls
 an Identifier. It does this without the Relying Party needing access to
 end user credentials such as a password or to other sensitive information
 such as an email address.
