Description: virtual machine and compiler for Lua in Go
 GopherLua is a Lua5.1 VM and compiler written in Go. GopherLua has the same
 goal as Lua: *Be a scripting language with extensible semantics*. It provides
 Go APIs that allow you to easily embed a scripting language to your Go host
 programs.
 .
 GopherLua APIs perform in much the same way as Lua, *but the stack is used
 only for passing arguments and receiving returned values.*
