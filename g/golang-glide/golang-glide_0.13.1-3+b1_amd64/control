Description: Vendor package management for Go
 Glide is comparable to tools like Cargo, npm, Composer, Bundler, pip,
 Maven but for Go. It manages vendored packages with ease.
 .
 Packages to be vendored are listed in a configuration file at the
 root of a project along with the appropriate restriction on versions
 and Glide will download the most recent versions satisfying the
 constraints into the vendor directory. It will write a lock file to
 record the exact versions chosen.
