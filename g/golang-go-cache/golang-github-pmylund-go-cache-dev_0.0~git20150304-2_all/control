Description: Go library for in-memory key/value store similar to memcached
 go-cache is an in-memory key:value store/cache similar to memcached
 that is suitable for applications running on a single machine. Its
 major advantage is that, being essentially a thread-safe
 map[string]interface{} with expiration times, it doesn't need to
 serialize or transmit its contents over the network.
