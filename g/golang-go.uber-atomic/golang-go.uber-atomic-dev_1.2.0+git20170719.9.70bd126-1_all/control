Description: Simple wrappers for primitive types to enforce atomic access
 The standard library's `sync/atomic` is powerful, but it's easy to forget which
 variables must be accessed atomically. `go.uber.org/atomic` preserves all the
 functionality of the standard library, but wraps the primitive types to
 provide a safer, more convenient API.
