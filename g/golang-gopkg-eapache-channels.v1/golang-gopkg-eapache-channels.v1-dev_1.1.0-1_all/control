Description: collection of helpers around golang's existing channels
 This package contains a collection of helper functions and special
 types for working with and extending Go's existing channels.
 .
 The heart consists of several distinct implementations of the Channel
 interface, including channels backed by special buffers (resizable,
 infinite, ring buffers, etc) and other useful types. A "black hole"
 channel for discarding unwanted values rounds out the set.
