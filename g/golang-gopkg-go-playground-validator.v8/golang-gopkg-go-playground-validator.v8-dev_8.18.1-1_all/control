Description: Go Struct and Field validation (version 8.x)
 Package validator implements value validations for structs and individual
 fields based on tags.
 .
 It has the following unique features:
   * Cross Field and Cross Struct validations by using validation tags or
     custom validators.
   * Slice, Array and Map diving, which allows any or all levels of a
     multidimensional field to be validated.
   * Handles type interface by determining it's underlying type prior to
     validation.
   * Handles custom field types such as sql driver Valuer
   * Alias validation tags, which allows for mapping of several validations
     to a single tag for easier defining of validations on structs
   * Extraction of custom defined Field Name e.g. can specify to extract the
     JSON name while validating and have it available in the resulting
     FieldError
