Description: PostgreSQL client and ORM for Golang
 Go-pg is a convenient PostgreSQL client and ORM for Golang with the
 following features:
 .
  -  Basic types: integers, floats, string, bool, time.Time.
                  sql.NullBool, sql.NullString, sql.NullInt64,
                  sql.NullFloat64 and pg.NullTime
  -  sql.Scanner and sql/driver.Valuer interfaces
  -  Structs, maps and arrays are marshalled as JSON by default
  -  PostgreSQL multidimensional Arrays using array tag and Array wrapper
  -  Hstore using hstore tag and Hstore wrapper
  -  All struct fields are nullable by default and zero values (empty string,
     0, zero time) are marshalled as SQL NULL. ``sql:",notnull"` is used to
     reverse this behaviour
  -  Transactions
  -  Prepared statements
  -  Notifications using LISTEN and NOTIFY
  -  Copying data using COPY FROM and COPY TO
  -  Timeouts
  -  Automatic connection pooling
  -  Queries retries on network errors
  -  Working with models using ORM and SQL
  -  Scanning variables using ORM and SQL
  -  SelectOrInsert using on-conflict
  -  INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE using ORM
  -  Common table expressions using WITH and WrapWith
  -  CountEstimate using EXPLAIN to get estimated number of matching rows
  -  HasOne, BelongsTo, HasMany and ManyToMany-
  -  Creating tables from structs
  -  Migrations
  -  Sharding
