Description: Go package for gracefully shutting down HTTP server
 This package enables graceful shutdown of a http.Handler server.
 When the process receives a SIGINT or SIGTERM, the listening
 port is closed immediately for reuse by another process, while
 active connections are gracefully terminated after a timeout.
