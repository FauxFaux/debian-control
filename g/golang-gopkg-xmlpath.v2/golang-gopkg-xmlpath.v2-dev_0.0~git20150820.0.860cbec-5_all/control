Description: strict subset of the XPath specification for the Go language
 Package xmlpath implements a strict subset of the XPath specification
 for the Go language. At the moment, xmlpath is compatible with the
 XPath specification to the following extent:
  - All axes are supported ("child", "following-sibling", etc)
  - All abbreviated forms are supported (".", "//", etc)
  - All node types except for namespace are supported
  - Predicates may be [N], [path], [not(path)], [path=literal]
    or [contains(path, literal)]
  - Predicates may be joined with "or", "and", and parenthesis
  - Richer expressions and namespaces are not supported
