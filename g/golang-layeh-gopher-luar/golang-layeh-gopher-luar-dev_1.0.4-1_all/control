Description: Simplifies data passing between Go and GopherLua
 A gopher-luar simplifies data passing to and from GopherLua.
 .
 This package provides the library for converting and passing the data
 types between Go and GopherLua.
 .
 Go type values are converted to GopherLua type:
  * Boolean values are converted to lua.LBool.
  * Numeric values are converted to lua.LNumber.
  * String values are converted to lua.LString.
  * A nil value is converted to lua.LNil.
  * Functions are converted to *lua.LFunction.
  * Arrays, channels, maps, pointers, slices, and structs are all
    converted to *lua.LUserData.
 .
 GopherLua type values are converted to Go type:
  * lua.LBool values are converted to bool.
  * lua.LNumber values are converted to float64.
  * lua.LString values are converted to string.
  * lua.LNil can be converted to any channel, func, interface, map,
    pointer, slice, unsafe pointer, or uintptr value.
