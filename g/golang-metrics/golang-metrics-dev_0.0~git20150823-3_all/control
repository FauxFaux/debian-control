Description: Go package to capture application-level metrics
 This package is a Go port of Coda Hale's Metrics library for Java. It
 allows one to easily collect metrics from an application written in
 Go in an unobtrusive way. Metrics can then be exported to syslog,
 files or to a storage system like Graphite.
