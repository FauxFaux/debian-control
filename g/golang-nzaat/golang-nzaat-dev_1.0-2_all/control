Description: Go implementation of the NZAAT hash algorithm
 Go implementation of the hash algorithm "NUL zaehlen an allen Teilen"
 based on the One At A Time hash (OAAT) by Bob Jenkins. This is not a
 cryptographic hash, but it satisfies the perfect hash criteria well
 enough to be usable as a hash table hash or similar.
