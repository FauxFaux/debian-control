Description: high level cgo wrapper around libykpiv.so.1
 go-ykpiv implements an idiomatic go API fit for use when applications need to
 communicate with a Yubikey in PIV mode.
 .
 Most PIV tokens, Yubikeys included, can be used as a PKCS#11 device using
 OpenSC, and Yubikeys are even capable of doing Signing and Decryption through
 that interface. However, some management functions are not exposed in the
 PKCS#11 OpenSC interface, so this library may be of use when one wants to write
 a new Certificate, or set PINs.
