Description: generic support for the IRC protocol in Go
 Package irc allows your application to speak the IRC protocol.
 .
  * Limited scope, does one thing and does it well.
  * Focus on simplicity and speed.
  * Stable API: updates shouldn't break existing software.
  * Well documented code.
 .
 This package does not manage your entire IRC connection. It only translates
 the protocol to easy to use Go types. It is meant as a single component in a
 larger IRC library, or for basic IRC bots for which a large IRC package would
 be overkill.
