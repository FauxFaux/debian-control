Description: Go library to implement virtual hosting for different protocols
 This is a simple library that lets you implement virtual hosting
 functionality for different protocols (HTTP and TLS so far). go-vhost
 has a high-level and a low-level interface. The high-level interface
 lets you wrap existing net.Listeners with "muxer" objects. The
 lower-level interface returns an object implementing net.Conn which
 works as if no bytes had been consumed.
