Description: Command line and interactive ncurses-based OSS audio mixer
 gom is a command line mixer utility with optional built-in ncurses
 interactive interface.
 .
 Its main feature is an exhaustive command line interface that makes
 it ideal for scripting (e.g. for audio recording, running at user
 and/or system login time, setting/restoring of settings, etc).
 .
 It supports OSS only, so if you want to use it with ALSA, you will
 need its OSS-compatible modules. If you want to use all possible
 features of ALSA however, you would need to use a mixer program
 dedicated for ALSA.
