Description: generic object-orientator (programming language)
 GOO is a dynamic, type-based, object-oriented language in the same family
 as Dylan and Scheme.  It is designed to be simple, productive, powerful,
 extensible, dynamic, efficient, and real-time.
 .
 Its main goal is to offer the best of both scripting and delivery
 languages, while at the same time incorporating an extreme back-to-basics
 philosophy.
