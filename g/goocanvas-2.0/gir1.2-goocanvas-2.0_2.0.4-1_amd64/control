Description: GObject introspection data for GooCanvas - gir bindings
 GooCanvas is a canvas widget for GTK+ that uses the Cairo 2D library for
 drawing. It has a model/view split, and uses interfaces for canvas items and
 views, so you can easily turn any application object into canvas items.
 .
 This package contains the GObject introspection data.
 .
 It can be used by packages using the GIRepository format to generate
 dynamic bindings.
