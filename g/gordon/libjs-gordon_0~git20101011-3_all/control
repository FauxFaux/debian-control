Description: Open source flash runtime written in pure javascript
 Gordon enables web developers to embed flash applications directly
 within the browser.  It is a web app written in pure javascript,
 and eliminates the need for end users to have a separate flash
 plugin (as long as they use sites that take advantage of gordon).
