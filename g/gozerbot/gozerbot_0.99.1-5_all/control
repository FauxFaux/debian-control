Description: IRC and Jabber bot written in Python
 Gozerbot is a channel bot that aids with conversation in IRC channels
 and Jabber conference rooms. It's mainly used to send notifications (RSS,
 Nagios, etc.) and to provide custom commands for the channel. More then
 just a channel bot Gozerbot aims to provide a platform for the user to
 program his own bot and make it into something that's useful. This is done
 with a plugin structure that makes it easy to program your own plugins.
 But Gozerbot comes with some batteries included, there are now over 100
 plugins already written and ready for use.
