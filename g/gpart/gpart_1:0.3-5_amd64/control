Description: Guess PC disk partition table, find lost partitions
 Gpart is a tool which tries to guess the primary partition table of a PC-type
 disk in case the primary partition table in sector 0 is damaged, incorrect or
 deleted.
 .
 It is also good at finding and listing the types, locations, and sizes of
 inadvertently-deleted partitions, both primary and logical. It gives you the
 information you need to manually re-create them (using fdisk, cfdisk, sfdisk,
 etc.).
 .
 The guessed table can also be written to a file or (if you firmly believe the
 guessed table is entirely correct) directly to a disk device.
 .
 Currently supported (guessable) filesystem or partition types:
 .
  * BeOS filesystem type.
  * BtrFS filesystem type.
  * FreeBSD/NetBSD/386BSD disklabel sub-partitioning scheme used on Intel
    platforms.
  * Linux second extended filesystem (Ext2).
  * MS-DOS FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 "filesystems".
  * IBM OS/2 High Performance filesystem.
  * Linux LVM and LVM2 physical volumes.
  * Linux swap partitions (versions 0 and 1).
  * The Minix operating system filesystem type.
  * MS Windows NT/2000 filesystem.
  * QNX 4.x filesystem.
  * The Reiser filesystem (version 3.5.X, X > 11).
  * Sun Solaris on Intel platforms uses a sub-partitioning scheme on PC hard
    disks similar to the BSD disklabels.
  * Silicon Graphics journaled filesystem for Linux.
 .
 Gpart is useful in recovery actions and forensics investigations.
