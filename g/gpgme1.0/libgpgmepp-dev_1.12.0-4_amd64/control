Description: C++ and Qt bindings for GPGME (development files)
 GpgME++ (aka GpgMEpp) is a C++ wrapper (or C++ bindings) for the
 GnuPG project's GPGME (GnuPG Made Easy) library.
 .
 QGpgME is a library that provides GPGME integration with QEventLoop
 and some Qt datatypes (e.g. QByteArray).
 .
 This package contains the headers and other files needed to compile
 against either of these libraries.
