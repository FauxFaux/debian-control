Description: Python interface to the GPGME GnuPG encryption library (Python 2)
 The "gpg" Python module is, for the most part, a direct interface to
 the C GPGME library.  However, it is re-packaged in a more Pythonic
 way -- object-oriented with classes and modules.  Take a look at the
 classes defined here -- they correspond directly to certain object
 types in GPGME for C.
 .
 Features:
  * Feature-rich, full implementation of the GPGME library. Supports
    all GPGME features except interactive editing (coming soon).
    Callback functions may be written in pure Python.
  * Ability to sign, encrypt, decrypt, and verify data.
  * Ability to list keys, export and import keys, and manage the keyring.
  * Fully object-oriented with convenient classes and modules.
 .
 This is the official upstream Python 2 binding for GPGME.
