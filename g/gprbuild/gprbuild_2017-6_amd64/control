Description: multi-language extensible build tool
 A set of tools for processing GNAT project files:
 gprconfig detects available compilers,
 gprbuild runs them;
 gprslave helps distributing the build work across the network;
 gprinstall copies the objects to their final destination;
 gprclean removes them.
 The default configuration supports Ada, Assembler, C, C++, Fortran,
 and can be extended to support user source processing tools.
