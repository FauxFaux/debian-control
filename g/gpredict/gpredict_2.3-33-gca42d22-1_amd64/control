Description: Satellite tracking program
 Gpredict is a real time satellite tracking and orbit prediction program
 for the Linux desktop. It uses the SGP4/SDP4 propagation algorithms together
 with NORAD two-line element sets (TLE).
 .
 Some core features of Gpredict include:
 .
  * Tracking of a large number of satellites only limited by the physical
    memory and processing power of the computer
  * Display the tracking data in lists, maps, polar plots and any combination
    of these
  * Have many modules open at the same either in a notebook or in their own
    windows. The modules can also run in full-screen mode
  * You can use many ground stations
  * Predict upcoming passes
  * Gpredict can run in real-time, simulated real-time (fast forward and
    backward), and manual time control
  * Detailed information both the real time and non-real time modes
  * Doppler tuning of radios via Hamlib rigctld
  * Antenna rotator control via Hamlib rotctld
