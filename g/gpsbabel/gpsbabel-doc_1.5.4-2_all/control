Description: GPS file conversion plus transfer to/from GPS units
 GPSBabel converts waypoints, tracks, and routes from one format to
 another, whether that format is a common mapping format like Delorme,
 Streets and Trips, or even a serial upload or download to a GPS unit
 such as those from Garmin and Magellan.
 .
 GPSBabel supports dozens of data formats and will be useful for tasks
 such as geocaching, mapping, and converting from one GPS unit to another.
 Among the interesting formats it supports are several GPS devices via
 a serial link, various PDA-based mapping programs, and various
 Geocaching data formats.
 .
 This package contains the detailed documentation of gpsbabel.
