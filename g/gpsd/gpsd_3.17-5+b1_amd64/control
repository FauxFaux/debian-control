Description: Global Positioning System - daemon
 The gpsd service daemon can monitor one or more GPS devices connected to
 a host computer, making all data on the location and movements of the
 sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947.
 .
 With gpsd, multiple GPS client applications can share access to devices
 without contention or loss of data. Also, gpsd responds to queries with a
 format that is substantially easier to parse than the different standards
 emitted by GPS devices.
