Description: Global Positioning System - Qt wrapper for libgps (development)
 The gpsd service daemon can monitor one or more GPS devices connected to
 a host computer, making all data on the location and movements of the
 sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947.
 .
 This package provides libQgpsmm, the Qt version of libgpsmm.
 It is a wrapper over libgps, the service library for querying GPS
 devices. libQgpsmm is available on all platforms which are supported
 by Qt4.
