Description: Global Positioning System - Python libraries
 The gpsd service daemon can monitor one or more GPS devices connected to
 a host computer, making all data on the location and movements of the
 sensors available to be queried on TCP port 2947.
 .
 This package contains a Python interface to connect to gpsd, together with
 a module providing a controlled testing environment. It also ships two tools
 which utilize the interface: gpsprof for latency-profiling, and gpsfake to
 simulate a GPS by playing back a logfile.
