Description: Simulator for Microchip's PIC microcontrollers
 Gpsim is a full-featured software simulator for Microchip PIC microcontrollers.
 .
 Gpsim has been designed to be as accurate as possible. Accuracy includes the
 entire PIC - from the core to the I/O pins and including ALL of the internal
 peripherals. Thus it's possible to create stimuli and tie them to the I/O pins
 and test the PIC the same PIC the same way you would in the real world.
 .
 Gpsim has been designed to be as fast as possible. Real time simulation speeds
 of 20Mhz PICs are possible.
 .
 Gpsim has been designed to be as useful as possible. The standard simulation
 paradigm including breakpoints, single stepping, disassembling, memory inspect
 & change, have been implemented. In addition, gpsim supports many debugging
 features that are only available with in-circuit emulators. For example, a
 continuous trace buffer tracks every action of the simulator. Also, it's
 possible to set read and write break points on values (e.g. break if a specific
 value is read from or written to a register).
