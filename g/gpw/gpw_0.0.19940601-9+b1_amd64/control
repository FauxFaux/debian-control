Description: Trigraph Password Generator
 This package generates pronounceable passwords. It uses the statistics of
 three-letter combinations (trigraphs) taken from whatever dictionaries you
 feed it.
 .
 Thus pronounceability may differ from language to language. Based
 on the ideas in Morrie Gasser's password generator for Multics, and Dan
 Edwards's generator for CTSS.  FIPS Standard 181 describes a similar
 digraph-based generator, derived from Gasser's.
