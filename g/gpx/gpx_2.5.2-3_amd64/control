Description: Gcode to x3g conversion post processor
 GPX is a post processing utility for converting gcode output from 3D slicing
 software like Cura, KISSlicer, S3DCreator and Slic3r to x3g files for
 standalone 3D printing on Makerbot Cupcake, ThingOMatic, and Replicator 1/2/2x
 printers - with support for both stock and sailfish firmwares.
 .
 G-codes are plain-text files containing instructions for controlling CNC
 milling machines and consumer-grade 3D printers adapted from CNC milling
 machines.
