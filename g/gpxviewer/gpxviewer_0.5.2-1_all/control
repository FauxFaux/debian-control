Description: views GPS traces collected in the GPX format
 This application allows the user to load a GPS trace, in the GPX file format,
 and read it in a presentable way. You are shown a few statistics, such as the
 duration or maximum speed. You are also shown the trace on an openstreetmap
 map, where you can scroll around and zoom.
