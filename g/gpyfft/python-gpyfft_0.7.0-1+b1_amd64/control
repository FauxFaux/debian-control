Description: Wrapper for the OpenCL FFT library clFFT (Python 2)
 This python wrapper is designed to tightly integrate with
 PyOpenCL. It consists of a low-level Cython based wrapper with an
 interface similar to the underlying C library. On top of that it
 offers a high-level interface designed to work on data contained in
 instances of pyopencl.array.Array, a numpy work-alike array class for
 GPU computations. The high-level interface takes some inspiration
 from pyFFTW. For details of the high-level interface see fft.py.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 2.
