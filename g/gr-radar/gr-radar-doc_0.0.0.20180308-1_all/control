Description: GNU Radio Radar Toolbox - Documentation
 The *gr-radar* project provides a toolbox of commonly used radar
 algorithms. An important part is the *UHD Echotimer*, which enables a
 synchronized TX and RX stream from USRPs to ensure a constant phase
 relation in measurements. Example flowgraphs for CW, Dual CW, FSK,
 FMCW and OFDM radar are given and partly tested on hardware. GUI
 elements for target representation and further signal processing
 algorithms such as target tracking are implemented. Check out the
 project website for example videos and further information.
 .
 gr-radar-doc provides Doxygen generated documentation.
