Description: Gradle plugin for JFlex, a scanner generator
 The gradle-jflex-plugin makes it possible to integrate JFlex into the Gradle
 build system. JFlex itself is a lexical analyzer generator that takes as input
 a specification with a set of regular expressions and corresponding actions.
 It generates a program (a lexer) that reads input, matches the input against
 the regular expressions in the spec file, and runs the corresponding action if
 a regular expression matched.
