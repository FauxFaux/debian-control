Description: library of graphic data types (installed tests)
 Graphene provides a small set of mathematical types needed to implement
 graphic libraries that deal with 2D and 3D transformations and projections.
 .
 This library provides types and their relative API; it does not deal with
 windowing system surfaces, drawing, scene graphs, or input.
 .
 This package contains test programs, designed to be run as part of a
 regression testsuite.
