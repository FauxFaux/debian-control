Description: Enterprise Scalable Realtime Graphing (API-only frontend)
 Graphite consists of a storage backend and a web-based visualization
 frontend. Client applications send streams of numeric time-series
 data to the Graphite backend (called carbon), where it gets stored in
 fixed-size database files similar in design to RRD.
 .
 Graphite-API is an alternative to Graphite-web, without any built-in
 dashboard. Its role is solely to fetch metrics from a time-series
 database and rendering graphs or JSON data out of these time
 series. It is meant to be consumed by any of the numerous Graphite
 dashboard applications.
