Description: Enterprise Scalable Realtime Graphing
 Graphite consists of a storage backend and a web-based visualization
 frontend. Client applications send streams of numeric time-series
 data to the Graphite backend (called carbon), where it gets stored in
 fixed-size database files similar in design to RRD. The web frontend
 provides 2 distinct user interfaces for visualizing this data in
 graphs as well as a simple URL-based API for direct graph generation.
 .
 Graphite's design is focused on providing simple interfaces (both to
 users and applications), real-time visualization, high-availability,
 and enterprise scalability.
