Description: Emacs mode for the dot-language used by graphviz.
 Graphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph
 visualization is a way of representing structural information as
 diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. The Graphviz layout
 programs take descriptions of graphs in a simple text language, and
 make diagrams in useful formats. This package helps Emacs users edit
 the graphviz input language.
