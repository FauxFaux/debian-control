Description: Wrappers for doing Mathematics in Groovy
 Graxxia is a library adds data analysis features to Groovy, similar
 to languages such as R, Julia, etc, and also to libraries such as
 Pandas for Python.
 .
 It should be emphasised that there is nearly nothing in Graxxia
 itself that is not just a wrapper around other existing libraries.
 For example Matrix support all comes from Apache Commons Math,
 parsing of CSV and TSV (tab separated) files comes from OpenCSV and
 GroovyCSV, etc.
