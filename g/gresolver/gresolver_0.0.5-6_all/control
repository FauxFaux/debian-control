Description: graphical tool for performing DNS queries
 GResolver is a GTK+ graphical tool for DNS queries. It allows system
 administrators to quickly and easily make the most common DNS queries
 without constructing lengthy dig commands or nslookup.
 .
 GResolver supports all the main resource record types, including AAAA, AXFR,
 MX and TXT, and the appropriate in-addr.arpa address is constructed from
 dotted-quad IP addresses when doing PTR queries. There are checkboxes for
 controlling the most commonly-used options.
