Description: Utilities for Grid Engine queue management
 Grid Engine is software that facilitates "distributed resource
 management" (DRM).  Far more than just simple load-balancing tools or
 batch scheduling mechanisms, DRM software typically provides the
 following key features across large sets of distributed resources:
 .
   * Policy based allocation of distributed resources (CPU time,
     software licenses, etc.)
   * Batch queuing & scheduling
   * Support diverse server hardware, OS and architectures
   * Load balancing & remote job execution
   * Detailed job accounting statistics
   * Fine-grained user specifiable resources
   * Suspend/resume/migrate jobs
   * Tools for reporting Job/Host/Cluster status
   * Job Arrays
   * Integration & control of parallel jobs
 .
 This package contains the Grid Engine user utilities.
