Description: Run time libraries for mod_gridsite and gridsite-clients
 GridSite was originally a web application developed for managing and
 formatting the content of the http://www.gridpp.ac.uk/ website. Over
 the past years it has grown into a set of extensions to the Apache
 web server and a toolkit for Grid credentials, GACL access control
 lists and HTTP(S) protocol operations.
 .
 This package contains the runtime libraries.
