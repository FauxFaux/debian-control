Description: Framework for discovering and browsing media - Shared libraries
 Grilo is a framework focused on making media discovery and browsing
 easy for application developers.
 .
 More precisely, Grilo provides:
   * A single, high-level API that abstracts the differences among
     various media content providers, allowing application developers
     to integrate content from various services and sources easily.
   * A collection of plugins for accessing content from various media
     providers. Developers can share efforts and code by writing
     plugins for the framework that are application agnostic.
   * A flexible API that allows plugin developers to write plugins of
     various kinds.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.
