Description: Framework for discovering and browsing media - Documentation
 Grilo is a framework focused on making media discovery and browsing
 easy for application developers.

     various media content providers, allowing application developers
     to integrate content from various services and sources easily.

     providers. Developers can share efforts and code by writing
     plugins for the framework that are application agnostic.

     various kinds.
