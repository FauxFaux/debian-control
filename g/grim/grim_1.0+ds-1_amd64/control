Description: command-line utility to make screenshots of Wayland desktops
 grim is a command-line utility to take screenshots of Wayland desktops. For now
 it requires support for the screencopy protocol to work. Support for the
 xdg-output protocol is optional, but improves fractional scaling support.
 grim will write a PNG to a file or to stdout.
