Description: Integrates Grml ISO booting into GRUB
 This package provides a script for update-grub which looks for
 Grml ISO images in /boot/grml and automatically adds an entry
 for each image. The purpose is to use one of those images to
 boot a Grml rescue system without using a CD or USB stick.
