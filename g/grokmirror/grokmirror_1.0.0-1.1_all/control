Description: framework to smartly mirror git repositories
 grokmirror mirrors large git repository collections efficiently. It
 uses a manifest file published by a master mirror in order to figure
 out which repositories to clone and to track which repositories require
 updating. The process is extremely lightweight and efficient for both
 the master and its mirrors.
