Description: music player server with a web-based user interface
 Groove Basin runs on a server optionally connected to speakers. Guests can
 control the music player by connecting with a laptop, tablet, or smart phone.
 Further, users can stream their music libraries remotely.
 .
 Groove Basin comes with a fast, responsive web interface that supports keyboard
 shortcuts and drag drop. It also provides the ability to upload songs,
 download songs, and import songs by URL, including YouTube URLs.
 .
 Groove Basin supports Dynamic Mode which automatically queues random songs,
 favoring songs that have not been queued recently.
 .
 Groove Basin automatically performs ReplayGain scanning on every song using
 the EBU R128 loudness standard, and automatically switches between track
 and album mode.
 .
 Groove Basin supports the MPD protocol, which means it is compatible with MPD
 clients. There is also a more powerful Groove Basin protocol which you can
 use if the MPD protocol does not meet your needs.
 .
 Groove Basin supports Last.fm scrobbling.
