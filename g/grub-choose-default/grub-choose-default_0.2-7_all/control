Description: Control Grub Default through a GUI
 grub-choose-default gives you a GUI that you can use to easily select the next
 default for grub and you can go and grab a snack while your computer reboots
 without having to wait for anything.
 .
 It's a very simple program that just reads your grub menu entries and then
 lets you click on the one you want to be the next default.
