Description: Documentation for GRUB Legacy
 GRUB is a GPLed bootloader intended to unify bootloading across x86
 operating systems.  In addition to loading the Linux kernel,
 it implements the Multiboot standard, which allows for flexible loading
 of multiple boot images (needed for modular kernels such as the GNU Hurd).
