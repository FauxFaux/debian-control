Description: GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (EFI-IA32 binaries)
 GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a
 cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features:
 .
  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
    update-grub.
 .
 This package contains a version of GRUB that has been built for use with
 EFI-IA32 architecture, such as the one provided by Intel Macs (that is, unless
 a BIOS interface has been activated).  It will not automatically install
 GRUB as the active boot loader, nor will it automatically update grub.cfg
 on upgrade, so most people should install grub-efi-ia32 instead.
