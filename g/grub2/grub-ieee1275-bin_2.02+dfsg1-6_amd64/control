Description: GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (Open Firmware binaries)
 GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a
 cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features:
 .
  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
    update-grub.
 .
 This package contains a version of GRUB that has been built for use with
 Open Firmware implementations.  It will not automatically install GRUB as
 the active boot loader, nor will it automatically update grub.cfg on
 upgrade, so most people should install grub-ieee1275 instead.
