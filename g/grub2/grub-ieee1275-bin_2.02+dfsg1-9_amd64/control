Description: GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (Open Firmware modules)
 GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a
 cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features:
 .
  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
    update-grub.
 .
 This package contains GRUB modules that have been built for use with Open
 Firmware implementations.  It can be installed in parallel with other
 flavours, but will not automatically install GRUB as the active boot loader
 nor automatically update grub.cfg on upgrade unless grub-ieee1275 is also
 installed.
