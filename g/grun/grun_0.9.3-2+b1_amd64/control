Description: GTK+ based Run dialog
 gRun is a GTK+ based Run dialog that closely resembles
 the Windows Run dialog, just like xexec. It has a
 intelligent history mechanism and a dual level fork()
 mechanism for launching the application in its own
 process. gRun also has support for launching console
 mode application in an XTerm as well as associations
 for file types.
 .
 gRun is much more powerful than xexec, looks a lot
 better, and has the big advantage that you can start
 typing a command without having to mouse-click into
 the text field.
 .
 gRun is especially useful if you do not use the
 GNOME desktop which has a built-in run command, and
 if you use a window-manager (e.g. IceWM) where you can
 define a keyboard shortcut (e.g. Alt-F2) for staring
 gRun.
