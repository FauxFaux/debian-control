Description: GNU SASL debugging symbols
 GNU SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and
 Security Layer framework and a few common SASL mechanisms. SASL is
 used by network servers (e.g., IMAP, SMTP) to request authentication
 from clients, and in clients to authenticate against servers.
 .
 This package contains detached debugging information.  Most people
 will not need this package.  It is provided primarily to provide a
 backtrace with names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat easier to
 interpret core dumps.  GDB will find this debug information
 automatically.
