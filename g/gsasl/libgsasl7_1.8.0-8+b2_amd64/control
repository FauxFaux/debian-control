Description: GNU SASL library
 GNU SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and
 Security Layer framework and a few common SASL mechanisms. SASL is
 used by network servers (e.g., IMAP, SMTP) to request authentication
 from clients, and in clients to authenticate against servers.
 .
 Supported mechanisms are ANONYMOUS, EXTERNAL, LOGIN, PLAIN, SECURID, NTLM,
 DIGEST-MD5, CRAM-MD5, SCRAM-SHA-1, SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS, GS2-KRB5, GSSAPI.
 .
 This package includes the GNU SASL shared library that is required
 by applications using GNU SASL.  You normally don't need to install
 it manually.
