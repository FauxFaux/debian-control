Description: Advanced Gtk+ Sequencer core library (Development files)
 libags is a general purpose application context library built upon GObject
 providing persistence and configuration. It allows you to organize threads in
 a tree hierarchy that is synced 1000 times per second per default. Since it is
 written in a object orientated manner you might want to override its default
 behaviour.
 .
 This package includes the needed header files to develop with
 Advanced Gtk+ Sequencer base library.
