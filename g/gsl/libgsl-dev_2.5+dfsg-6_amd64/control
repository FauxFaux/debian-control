Description: GNU Scientific Library (GSL) -- development package
 The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of routines for
 numerical analysis.  The routines are written from scratch by the GSL
 team in C, and present a modern API for C programmers, while allowing
 wrappers to be written for very high level languages.
 .
 This package contains the header files, static libraries and symbolic
 links that developers using GNU GSL will need.
