Description: Debugging symbols for GSS
 The GNU Generic Security Service Library (GSSLib) is a free
 implementation of the GSS-API security framework.  GSSLib uses Shishi
 to implement the Kerberos V5 mechanism, but is flexible enough to
 support other mechanisms too.
 .
 This package contains detached debugging information.  Most people
 will not need this package.  It is provided primarily to provide a
 backtrace with names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat easier to
 interpret core dumps.  GDB will find this debug information
 automatically.
