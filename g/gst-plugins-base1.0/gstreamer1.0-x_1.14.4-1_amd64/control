Description: GStreamer plugins for X11 and Pango
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 This package contains the GStreamer plugins for X11 video output, both
 for standard Xlib support and for the Xv extension, as well as the
 plugin for Pango-based text rendering and overlay.
Gstreamer-Elements: clockoverlay, textoverlay, textrender, timeoverlay, ximagesink, xvimagesink
