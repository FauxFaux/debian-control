Description: GStreamer plugin for eSpeak speech synthesis
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data. Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related. Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.

 This package contains a GStreamer plugin for using eSpeak library as a
 sound source for GStreamer.  Plugin uses given text to produce audio
