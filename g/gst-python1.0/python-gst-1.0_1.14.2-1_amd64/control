Description: GStreamer GObject Introspection overrides for Python
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 This package contains GObject Introspection overrides for Python that
 can be used by Python applications using GStreamer.
