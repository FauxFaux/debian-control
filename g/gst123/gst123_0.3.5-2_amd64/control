Description: GStreamer based command line media player
 The program gst123 is designed to be a more flexible command line player in
 the spirit of ogg123 and mpg123, based on GStreamer. It plays all file formats
 supported by GStreamer, so if you have audio/video collections which contain
 different file formats, like flac, ogg and mp3, you can use gst123 to play all
 your audio/video files.
