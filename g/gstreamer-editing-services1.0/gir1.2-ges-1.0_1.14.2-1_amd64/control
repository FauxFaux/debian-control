Description: GObject introspection data for the GES library
 The GStreamer multimedia framework and the accompanying NLE set of
 plugins for non-linear editing offer all the building blocks for:
 * Decoding and encoding to a wide variety of formats, through all the
   available GStreamer plugins.
 * Easily choosing segments of streams and arranging them through time
   through the NLE set of plugins.
 But all those building blocks only offer stream-level access, which
 results in developers who want to write non-linear editors to write a
 consequent amount of code to get to the level of non-linear editing
 notions which are closer and more meaningful for the end-user
 (and therefore the application).
 .
 The GStreamer Editing Services (GES) aims to fill the gap between
 GStreamer/NLE and the application developer by offering a series
 of classes to simplify the creation of many kind of editing-related
 applications.
 .
 This package contains introspection data for the GStreamer editing
 services.
