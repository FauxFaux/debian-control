Description: GStreamer editing services (debug symbols)
 The GStreamer multimedia framework and the accompanying NLE set of
 plugins for non-linear editing offer all the building blocks for:
 * Decoding and encoding to a wide variety of formats, through all the
   available GStreamer plugins.
 * Easily choosing segments of streams and arranging them through time
   through the NLE set of plugins.
 But all those building blocks only offer stream-level access, which
 results in developers who want to write non-linear editors to write a
 consequent amount of code to get to the level of non-linear editing
 notions which are closer and more meaningful for the end-user
 (and therefore the application).
 .
 The GStreamer Editing Services (GES) aims to fill the gap between
 GStreamer/NLE and the application developer by offering a series
 of classes to simplify the creation of many kind of editing-related
 applications.
 .
 This package contains unstripped shared libraries. It is provided primarily
 to provide a backtrace with names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat
 easier to interpret core dumps. The libraries are installed in
 /usr/lib/debug and are automatically used by gdb.
