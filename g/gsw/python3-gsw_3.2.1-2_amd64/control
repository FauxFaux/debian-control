Description: Python 3 implementation of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater
 This package implements the TEOS-10 Equation of State for seawater.
 TEOS-10 is based on a Gibbs function formulation from which all
 thermodynamic properties of seawater (density, enthalpy, entropy sound speed,
 etc.) can be derived in a thermodynamically consistent manner.
 TEOS-10 was adopted by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission at its
 25th Assembly in June 2009 to replace EOS-80 as the official description of
 seawater and ice properties in marine science.
