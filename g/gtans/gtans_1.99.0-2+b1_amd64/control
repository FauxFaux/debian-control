Description: Tangram (puzzle) game using GTK+
 The Tangram is a Chinese puzzle where the player has to arrange a set of
 pieces to match a given shape. All the pieces must be used and should not
 be laid on top of one another. The pieces are five triangles, a square and
 a parallelogram. gtans contains more than 380 figures to play with. It uses
 the mouse to control pieces. gtans is highly customizable using the
 interface.
