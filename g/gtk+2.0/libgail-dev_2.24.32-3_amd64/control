Description: GNOME Accessibility Implementation Library -- development files
 Gail implements ATK interfaces for GTK+ widgets which are dynamically
 loadable at runtime by a GTK+ application. Once loaded, those parts of
 an application that use standard GTK+ widgets will have a basic level
 of accessibility, without the need to modify the application at all.
 .
 This package contains the development files for Gail.
