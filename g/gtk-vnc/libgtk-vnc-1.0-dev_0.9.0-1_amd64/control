 remaining single threaded. It supports RFB protocols 3.3 through 3.8 and the
 VeNCrypt authentication extension providing SSL/TLS encryption with x509
 certificate authentication.

 The core library is written in C and a bindings for other languages are
 available via GObject introspection. The networking layer supports connections
 over both IPv4 and IPv6.
 .
 This package contains the development headers for programs built against
 GTK+2.
