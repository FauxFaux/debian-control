Description: Tools to build the Gtk2Hs suite of User Interface libraries
 This package provides a set of helper programs necessary to build the Gtk2Hs
 suite of libraries. These tools include a modified c2hs binding tool that is
 used to generate FFI declarations, a tool to build a type hierarchy that
 mirrors the C type hierarchy of GObjects found in glib, and a generator for
 signal declarations that are used to call back from C to Haskell. These tools
 are not needed to actually run Gtk2Hs programs.
