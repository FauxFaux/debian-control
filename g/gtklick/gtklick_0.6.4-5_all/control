Description: simple metronome GUI for JACK
 gtklick is a simple metronome with an easy-to-use GTK+ interface,
 supporting the JACK sound server.
 .
 It features different sounds to choose from,
 arbitrary meters and beat patterns, a speed trainer,
 and the ability to save and restore profiles.
 gtklick is implemented as a frontend to klick and uses OSC messages
 to communicate with the backend.
 .
 Using klick directly on the command line offers additional features
 like tempo maps and synchronization with JACK transport.
