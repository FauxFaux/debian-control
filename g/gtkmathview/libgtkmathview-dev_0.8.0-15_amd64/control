Description: rendering engine for MathML documents
 GtkMathView is a C++ rendering engine for MathML documents. It
 provides an interactive view that can be used for browsing and
 editing MathML markup.
 .
 GtkMathView reads MathML documents by means of a frontend whose
 purpose is to traverse the MathML document (or part of it) and
 to appropriately instantiate GtkMathView's internal data
 structures that are suitable for rendering it.  Currently the
 following frontends are supported: libxml2 (tree view using
 libxml2 API), libxml2 reader (event view using libxml2 reader
 API), GMetaDOM (tree view using DOM API), custom
 (application-specific view with application-provided callbacks).
 .
 GtkMathView renders MathML documents through a backend whose
 purpose is to provide an interface between the portable
 rendering engine and the platform-specific capabilities (like
 retrieving fonts, drawing on the screen, and so on). Currently
 the following backends are provided: GTK+, GTK+ widget,
 PostScript, SVG, AbiWord.
 .
 This package includes the development support files.
