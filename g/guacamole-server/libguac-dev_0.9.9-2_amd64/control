Description: Guacamole proxy daemon (core library headers)
 The Guacamole proxy daemon, guacd, translates between remote desktop
 protocols (like VNC) and the Guacamole protocol using protocol plugins.
 Once a user is authenticated with the Guacamole web application, a tunnel
 is established through the web application to guacd, allowing the JavaScript
 client to communicate to an arbitrary remote desktop server through guacd.
 .
 This package contains development headers for the core library.
