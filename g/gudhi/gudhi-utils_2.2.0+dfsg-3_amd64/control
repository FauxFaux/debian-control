Description: Utilities from the GUDHI library
 The GUDHI library is a generic open source C++ library for
 Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and Higher Dimensional Geometry
 Understanding. The library offers state-of-the-art data structures
 and algorithms to construct simplicial complexes and compute
 persistent homology.
 .
 The GUDHI library is developed as part of the GUDHI project supported
 by the European Research Council.
 .
 This package contains some utilities built with the GUDHI library.
