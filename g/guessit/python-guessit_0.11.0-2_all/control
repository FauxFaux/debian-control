Description: library for guessing information from video filenames (Python 2)
 GuessIt is a Python library that tries to extract as much information as
 possible from a video file. It has a very powerful filename matcher that allows
 one to guess a lot of metadata from a video using only its filename. This
 matcher works with both movies and TV show episodes.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 module.
