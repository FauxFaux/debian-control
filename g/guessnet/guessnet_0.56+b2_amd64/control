Description: Guess which LAN a network device is connected to
 Guessnet is a non-aggressive network detection tool to use when moving
 a machine among networks which don't necessarily provide DHCP.
 .
 Guessnet takes in input a list of candidate network profiles,
 each of which includes a test description; then it runs all
 the tests in parallel and prints the name of the profile whose
 test was the first one to succeed.
 .
 Available tests are:
  * ARP probes to check for known hosts in the network
  * link beat check, to check if the interface is connected to anything
  * PPPOE check to see if there is a concentrator accessible via PPPOE
  * Checks provided by custom arbitrary scripts.
 .
 Guessnet can be used in either native mode or "ifupdown mode".
 In the latter case guessnet integrates nicely with ifupdown
 as a "mapping script".
