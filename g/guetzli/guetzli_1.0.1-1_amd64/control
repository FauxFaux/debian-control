Description: perceptual JPEG encoder
 Guetzli is a JPEG encoder that aims for excellent compression density
 at high visual quality. Guetzli-generated images are typically 20-30%
 smaller than images of equivalent quality generated by libjpeg. Guetzli
 generates only sequential (nonprogressive) JPEGs due to faster
 decompression speeds they offer.
