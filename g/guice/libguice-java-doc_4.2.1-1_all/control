Description: documentation for libguice-java
 Documentation for Guice that is a framework that provides support for
 dependency injection using annotations to configure Java objects.
 Dependency injection is a design pattern whose core principle is to
 separate behavior from dependency resolution.
 .
 Guice allows implementation classes to be programmatically bound to
 an interface, then injected into constructors, methods or fields
 using an @Inject annotation. When more than one implementation of
 the same interface is needed, the user can create custom annotations
 that identify an implementation, then use that annotation when
 injecting it.
 .
 This package provides javadocs for Guice framework and example code.
