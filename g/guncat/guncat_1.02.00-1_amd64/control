Description: Catenates files while decrypting PGP-encrypted sections
 Guncat acts like unix's cat command, but handles
 (partially) encrypted sections of processed files.
 Sections of guncat's input files which are surrounded by
 -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
 and
 -----END PGP MESSAGE-----
 markers are decrypted before being concatenated to the
 standard output stream.
 .
 Guncat's output (i.e., the standard output stream) may
 subsequently be processed by other programs, like grep
 or less.  Guncat supports reading a decryption passphrase
 either from stdin or from gpg-agent.
 .
 Guncat stands for (Gpg UNencrypting CAT) and was designed to
 facilitate searching through (partially) PGP encrypted files,
 as encountered in mailboxes, for example.
