Description: let a remote site change their newsgroups subscription
 Gup, the Group Update Program is a Unix mail-server that lets a remote
 site change their newsgroups subscription without requiring the
 intervention of the news administrator at the feed site.
 .
 Gup is suited to news administrators that find they are spending an
 inordinate amount of time editing the INN newsfeeds file on behalf of
 the remote sites.
