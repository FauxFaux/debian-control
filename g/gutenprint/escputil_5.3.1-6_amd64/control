Description: maintenance utility for Epson Stylus printers
 escputil is a utility to clean and align the heads of Epson Stylus
 printers.  It can also check the current ink levels in the printer.

 Gutenprint is the print facility for the GIMP, and in addition a
 suite of drivers that may be used with common UNIX spooling systems
 using GhostScript or CUPS.  These drivers provide printing quality
 for UNIX/Linux on a par with proprietary vendor-supplied drivers in
 many cases, and can be used for many of the most demanding printing
 tasks.  Gutenprint was formerly known as Gimp-Print.
