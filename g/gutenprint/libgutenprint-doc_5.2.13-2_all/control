 Gutenprint is the print facility for the GIMP, and in addition a
 suite of drivers that may be used with common UNIX spooling systems
 using GhostScript or CUPS.  These drivers provide printing quality
 for UNIX/Linux on a par with proprietary vendor-supplied drivers in
 many cases, and can be used for many of the most demanding printing
 tasks.  Gutenprint was formerly known as Gimp-Print.
