Description: printer drivers for CUPS
 This package includes a CUPS driver based on Gutenprint.
 .
 The CUPS drivers contain all of the files needed to support
 photo-quality printing on any printer supported by Gutenprint.  You
 can find out more about the Common UNIX Printing System ("CUPS"), an
 IPP-based printing system for UNIX/Linux, at:
 .
   http://www.cups.org
 .
 Gutenprint is the print facility for the GIMP, and in addition a
 suite of drivers that may be used with common UNIX spooling systems
 using GhostScript or CUPS.  These drivers provide printing quality
 for UNIX/Linux on a par with proprietary vendor-supplied drivers in
 many cases, and can be used for many of the most demanding printing
 tasks.  Gutenprint was formerly known as Gimp-Print.
