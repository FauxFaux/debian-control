Description: userspace virtual filesystem - deprecated command-line tools
 gvfs is a userspace virtual filesystem where mounts run as separate
 processes which you talk to via D-Bus. It also contains a gio module
 that seamlessly adds gvfs support to all applications using the gio
 API. It also supports exposing the gvfs mounts to non-gio applications
 using fuse.
 .
 This package contains deprecated command-line tools such as gvfs-copy
 and gvfs-rename. Please use the gio(1) tool in the libglib2.0-bin
 package instead.
