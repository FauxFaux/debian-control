Description: waveform viewer eg for spice simulators
 Gwave is a tool for viewing analog data, such as the output of Spice
 simulations.
 .
 Gwave can read "raw" files from spice2G6, spice3F5 or ngspice, and a tabular
 ASCII format suitable for use with GnuCAP or homegrown tools. It can also read
 several binary and ascii files written by commercial spice-type simulators
 such as hspice, tspice, and nanosim.
 .
 It supports multiple "panels" (graticules) with multiple variables displayed
 in each. Two vertical-bar cursors are available for time-difference
 measurements. Multiple files can be loaded, for comparing results of several
 simulations.
