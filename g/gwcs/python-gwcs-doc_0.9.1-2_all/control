Description: Tools for managing the WCS of astronomical data (documentation)
 GWCS takes a general approach to WCS. It supports a data model which includes
 the entire transformation pipeline from input coordinates (detector by
 default) to world coordinates.  The goal is to provide a flexible toolkit
 which is easily extendible by adding new transforms and frames.
 .
 This is the common documentation package.
