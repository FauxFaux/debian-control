Description: generic Whois Client / Server
 gwhois is a generic whois client / server. This means that it know
 for many (virtually all) TLDs, IP-Ranges and Handles out there where
 to ask. It queries other whois-servers as well as web-lookup forms.
 .
 gwhois can be used as a client, but you can invoke it as a server
 (e.g. via inetd) as well for usage with a normal whois client.
