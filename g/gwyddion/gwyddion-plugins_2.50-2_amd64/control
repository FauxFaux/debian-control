Description: plugins for Gwyddion SPM analysis tool
 Gwyddion is a modular program for Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) data
 visualization and analysis. It is primarily intended for analysis of height
 field data obtained by microscopy techniques like
  * Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM),
  * Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM),
  * Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM),
  * Near-field Scanning Optical Microscopy (SNOM or NSOM)
 and others. However, it can be used for arbitrary height field and
 image analysis.
 .
 This package yet contains only sample plugins for Gwyddion in Python, Ruby
 and Perl.
 .
 If you would like to extend Gwyddion's functionality, you are encouraged
 to consider writing Gwyddion modules instead of plugins. For help on this, see
 the package libgwyddion20-doc.
