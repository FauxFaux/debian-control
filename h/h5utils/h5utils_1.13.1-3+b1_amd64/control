Description: HDF5 files visualization tools
 HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format 5) is a file format for storing
 scientific data. These tools allow converting other formats to
 HDF5 and to visualize HDF5 files. They include:
  - h5topng, which extracts a 2d slice of an HDF5 file and
    outputs a corresponding image in PNG format;
  - h5totxt, which extracts 2d slices and outputs comma-delimited
    text (suitable for import into a spreadsheet);
  - h5fromtxt, which converts simple text input into
    multi-dimensional numeric HDF5 datasets;
  - h5fromh4, which converts HDF4 data to HDF5;
  - h5tovtk, which converts HDF5 files to VTK files for
    visualization with VTK-aware programs;
