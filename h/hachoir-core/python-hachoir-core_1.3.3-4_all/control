Description: Core of Hachoir framework: parse and edit binary files
 Hachoir is a Python library used to represent of a binary file as a tree of
 Python objects. Each object has a type, a value, an address, etc. The goal is
 to be able to know the meaning of each bit in a file.
 .
 Why using slow Python code instead of fast hardcoded C code? Hachoir has many
 interesting features:
  * Autofix: Hachoir is able to open invalid / truncated files
  * Lazy: Open a file is very fast since no information is read from file,
    data are read and/or computed when the user ask for it
  * Types: Hachoir has many predefined field types (integer, bit, string, etc.)
    and supports string with charset (ISO-8859-1, UTF-8, UTF-16, ...)
  * Addresses and sizes are stored in bit, so flags are stored as classic fields
  * Endian: You have to set endian once, and then number are converted in the
    right endian
  * Editor: Using Hachoir representation of data, you can edit, insert, remove
    data and then save in a new file.
