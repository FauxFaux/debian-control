Description: Compatibility library to allow playback of Flash DRM content
 A libhal stub library forwarding to UDisks specifically to satisfy the
 libflashplayer.so / libadobecp requirements.
 .
 It is loosely based upon libhal.[ch] from the hal-0.5.14 package
 for the external interface presented by the shared library libhal.
 Further information on HAL can be found here:
 http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/hal
 .
 The Adobe Flash web browser plugin for Linux relies upon libhal to provide
 information required by libadobecp (which libflashplayer.so retrieves
 from the internet) for playing back drm content.
 .
 Since HAL is no longer centric to most modern Linux systems (now there
 are succeeded product such as UDev, UDisks and so on).
 This library provides thin wrapper until such time as HTML5 becomes
 standard for online TV (many sites continue to use Flash).
