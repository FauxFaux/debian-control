Description: pacman-like game, child oriented
 Help Hannah's Horse is like a cross between Pacman and the Dizzy game
 "Fastfood". The objective is to move Hannah to collect the pills around
 the maze while avoiding the ghosts. Moving around the maze there are also
 carrots which Hannah must also collect in order to complete the level.
