Description: Parser generator for Haskell
 Happy is a parser generator system for Haskell, similar to the tool `yacc' for
 C. Like `yacc', it takes a file containing an annotated BNF specification of a
 grammar and produces a Haskell module containing a parser for the grammar.
 .
 Happy is flexible: you can have several Happy parsers in the same program, and
 several entry points to a single grammar. Happy can work in conjunction with a
 lexical analyser supplied by the user (either hand-written or generated by
 another program), or it can parse a stream of characters directly (but this
 isn't practical in most cases).
