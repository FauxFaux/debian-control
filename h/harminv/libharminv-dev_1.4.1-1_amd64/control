Description: Library for using harminv, development version
 Libharminv is a free library to solve the problem of harmonic inversion,
 given a discrete-time, finite-length signal that consists of a sum of
 finitely-many sinusoids (possibly exponentially decaying) in a given
 bandwidth, it determines the frequencies, decay constants, amplitudes, and
 phases of those sinusoids.
