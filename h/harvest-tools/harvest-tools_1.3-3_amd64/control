Description: archiving and postprocessing for reference-compressed genomic multi-alignments
 HarvestTools is a utility for creating and interfacing with Gingr files,
 which are efficient archives that the Harvest Suite uses to store
 reference-compressed multi-alignments, phylogenetic trees, filtered
 variants and annotations. Though designed for use with Parsnp and Gingr,
 HarvestTools can also be used for generic conversion between standard
 bioinformatics file formats.
