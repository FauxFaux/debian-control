Description: CGI scripting program for embedded environments
 Haserl is a CGI wrapper that allows PHP-style programming in Lua or a
 POSIX-compliant shell. It is very small, so it can be used in embedded
 environments, or where something like PHP is too big.
 .
 It combines three features into a small CGI engine:
  * It parses POST and GET requests, placing form-elements into the
    environment as name=value pairs for the CGI script to use. This is
    somewhat similar to the uncgi wrapper.
  * It opens a shell, and translates all text into printable statements.
    All text within <% ... %> constructs is passed verbatim to the shell.
    This is somewhat similar to how PHP scripts are parsed.
  * It can be set up to drop its permissions to the owner of the script,
    giving it some of the security features of suexec or cgiwrapper.
