Description: recursively compute hashsums or piecewise hashings
 hashdeep is a set of tools to compute MD5, SHA1, SHA256, tiger
 and whirlpool hashsums of arbitrary number of files recursively.
 .
 The main hashdeep features are:
 .
   * It can compare those hashsums with a list of known hashes;
   * The tools can display those that match the list or those that
     does not match;
   * It can  display a time estimation when processing large files.
   * It can do piecewise hashing (hash input files in arbitrary
     sized blocks).
 .
 This package is useful in forensics investigations.
