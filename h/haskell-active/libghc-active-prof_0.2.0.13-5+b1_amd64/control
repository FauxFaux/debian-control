Description: Abstractions for animation; profiling libraries
 Inspired by the work of Kevin Matlage and Andy Gill (Every Animation Should
 Have a Beginning, a Middle, and an End, Trends in Functional Programming,
 2010), this library defines a simple abstraction for working with time-varying
 values. In a sense, this is sort of like a stripped-down version of functional
 reactive programming (FRP), without the reactivity.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
