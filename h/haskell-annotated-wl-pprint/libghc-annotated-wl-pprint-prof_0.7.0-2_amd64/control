Description: Wadler/Leijen Pretty Printer, with annotation support; profiling libraries
 This is a modified version of wl-pprint, which was based on Wadler's
 paper "A Prettier  Printer". This version allows the library user to
 annotate the text with semantic information, which can later be rendered
 in a variety of ways.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
