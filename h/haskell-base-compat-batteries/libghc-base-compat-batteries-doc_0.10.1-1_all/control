Description: base-compat with extra batteries; documentation
 Provides functions available in later versions of base to a wider
 range of compilers, without requiring you to use CPP pragmas
 in your code.
 .
 This package provides the same API as the base-compat library,
 but depends on compatibility packages (such as semigroups) to offer
 a wider support window than base-compat, which has no dependencies.
 Most of the modules in this library have the same names as in
 base-compat to make it easier to switch between the two. There also
 exist versions of each module with the suffix .Repl.Batteries, which
 are distinct from anything in base-compat, to allow for easier
 use in GHCi.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
