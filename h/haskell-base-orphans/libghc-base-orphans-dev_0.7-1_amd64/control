Description: Backwards-compatible orphan instances for base
 base-orphans defines orphan instances that mimic instances available in later
 versions of base to a wider (older) range of compilers. base-orphans does
 not export anything except the orphan instances themselves and complements
 the base-compat package.

 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
