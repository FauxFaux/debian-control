Description: most complete prelude formed solely from the "base" package; profiling libraries
 A library which aims to reexport all the non-conflicting and
 most general definitions from the base package.
 This includes APIs for applicatives, arrows, monoids, foldables,
 traversables, exceptions, generics, ST, MVars and STM.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
