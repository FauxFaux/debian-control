Description: Unicode alternatives for common functions and operators; profiling libraries
 All symbols are documented with their actual definition and information
 regarding their Unicode code point. They should be completely
 interchangeable with their definitions.
 .
 For further Unicode goodness you can enable the UnicodeSyntax language
 extension [1]. This extension enables Unicode characters to be used to
 stand for certain ASCII character sequences, i.e. → instead of ->, ∀
 instead of forall and many others.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
