Description: Foundation scrap box of array & string; profiling libraries
 Foundation is an attempt to provide a base-like set of modules
 that provide a consistent set of features and bugfixes across
 multiple versions of GHC (unlike base), and to provide a better
 and more efficient prelude than base's prelude.
 .
 This library (basement) is Foundation's most basic primitives
 without any dependencies.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
