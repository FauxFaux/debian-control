Description: parsec-/attoparsec-style parsing combinators; documentation
 This package extends binary with parsec/attoparsec style parsing
 combinators. It's useful when you want to deal with various binary
 format, and it's very fast. You can now write more complex Binary
 instances using comprehensive combinators, with serialisation
 packages like blaze-texual.
 .
 Binary's Get monad is designed to perform best on non-backtracking
 cases, but it still provides fast backtracking support via
 Alternative instance, it's overall an excellent alternative to
 attoparsec if you only deal with ByteString.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
