Description: FFI domain specific language, on top of hsc2hs; documentation
 This is a set of macros to be used when writing Haskell FFI. They were
 designed to be able to fully describe C interfaces, so that hsc2hs can
 extract from them all Haskell code needed to mimic such interfaces. All
 Haskell names used are automatically derived from C names, structures
 are mapped to Haskell instances of Storable, and there are also macros
 you can use with C code to help write bindings to inline functions or
 macro functions.
 .
 This package contains no Haskell code, only C header files designed
 for hsc2hs.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
