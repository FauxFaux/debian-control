Description: fold function for Bool type; documentation
 Function `bool' allows folding over boolean values, that is
 comparable to the `maybe' or `either' functions on their respective
 types.
 .
 Function `bool' is a replacement for the build-in if-then-else
 syntax. However, since it is a function, it can be partially
 applied and passed around to higher order functions.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
