Description: A library for tracking the consumption of a lazy ByteString; documentation
 In some cases, it is useful to know how fast a ByteString is being
 consumed. Typically, this could be to report some measure of progress
 to a waiting user, but it could also be to perform some form of testing
 on input / consumption code.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
