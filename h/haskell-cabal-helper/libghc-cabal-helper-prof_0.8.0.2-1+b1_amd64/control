Description: simple interface to some of Cabal's configuration state; profiling libraries
 cabal-helper provides a library which wraps the internal use of
 an executable to lift the restrictions imposed by linking against versions of
 GHC before 7.10. This has the pleasant side effect of isolating the user
 from having to deal with Cabal version changes manually as cabal-helper
 can simply recompile it's helper program automatically as needed.
 .
 cabal-helper uses a wrapper executable to compile the actual cabal-helper
 executable at runtime while linking against an arbitrary version of
 Cabal. This runtime-compiled helper executable is then used to extract
 various bits and peices from Cabal's on disk state (dist/setup-config)
 written by it's configure command.
 .
 In addition to this the wrapper executable also supports installing any
 version of Cabal from hackage in case it cannot be found in any available
 package database. The wrapper installs these instances of the Cabal library
 into a private package database so as to not interfere with the user's
 packages.
 .
 Furthermore the wrapper supports one special case namely reading a state
 file for Cabal itself. This is needed as Cabal compiles it's Setup.hs using
 itself and not using any version of Cabal installed in any package database.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
