Description: Serialize instances for Data.Vector types; documentation
 Data.Serialize functions for Data.Vector.Generic vectors. Orphan
 instances are provided for Data.Vector, Data.Vector.Unboxed,
 Data.Vector.Storable, and Data.Vector.Primitive vectors.
 .
 The serialized format is an Int64 representing the length of the
 vector, followed by the Data.Serialized contents of each element.
 .
 Note that the functions in Data.Vector.Storable.UnsafeSerialize
 perform much better when serialization does not need to account for
 host endianness and word size.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
