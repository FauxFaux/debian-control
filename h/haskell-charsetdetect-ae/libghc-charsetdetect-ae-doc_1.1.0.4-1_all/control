Description: charset detection using Mozilla's Universal Character Set Detector; documentation
 Mozilla have developed a robust and efficient character set detection
 algorithm for use in their web browsers.  The algorithm is able to detect all
 of the most frequently encountered character encodings totally automatically.
 .
 This library wraps up their library and exposes a very simple Haskell
 interface to it. The library is portable, and is confirmed to work on both
 Unix and Windows.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
