Description: charset detection using Mozilla's Universal Character Set Detector; profiling libraries
 Mozilla have developed a robust and efficient character set detection
 algorithm for use in their web browsers.  The algorithm is able to detect all
 of the most frequently encountered character encodings totally automatically.
 .
 This library wraps up their library and exposes a very simple Haskell
 interface to it. The library is portable, and is confirmed to work on both
 Unix and Windows.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
