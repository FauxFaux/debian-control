Description: AES and common modes
 Cipher-aes128 is an implementation of AES and common modes of operation.
 .
 It borrows Hanquez's C AES code (see 'cipher-aes') but is unique due to
   * including compile-time detection of NI compiler support,
   * a slightly more functional interface for GCM operations,
   * exposure of 'Ptr' based operations via the .Internal module, and
   * build-in crypto-api support.
 Cipher-aes128 was originally developed as "'cipher-aes' plus trampolines",
 which has since been adopted into cipher-aes.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
