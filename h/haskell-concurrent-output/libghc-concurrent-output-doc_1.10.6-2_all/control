Description: ungarble output from several threads; documentation
 Provides a simple interface for writing concurrent programs that
 need to output a lot of status messages to the console, or display
 multiple progress bars for different activities at the same time,
 or concurrently run external commands that output to the console.
 .
 Built on top of that is a way of defining multiple output regions,
 which are automatically laid out on the screen and can be individually
 updated. Can be used for progress displays etc.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
