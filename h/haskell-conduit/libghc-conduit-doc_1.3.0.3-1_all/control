Description: streaming data processing library; documentation
 Conduits are an approach to the streaming data problem. It is meant as an
 alternative to enumerators/iterators, hoping to address the same issues with
 different trade-offs based on real-world experience with enumerators. For
 more information, see http://www.yesodweb.com/book/conduit.

 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
