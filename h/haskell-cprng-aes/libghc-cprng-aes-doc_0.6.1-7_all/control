Description: pseudo-random number generator using AES in counter mode; documentation
  It contains a simple crypto pseudo-random-number-generator with
 really good randomness property.
 .
 Using ent, a randomness property maker on one 1Mb sample:
 Entropy = 7.999837 bits per byte. Optimum compression would reduce
 the size of this 1048576 byte file by 0 percent. Chi square distribution
 for 1048576 samples is 237.02 Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is
 127.3422 (127.5 = random) Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.143589568
 (error 0.06 percent).
 .
 Compared to urandom with the same sampling: Entropy = 7.999831 bits per
 byte. Optimum compression would reduce the size of this 1048576 byte file
 by 0 percent. Chi square distribution for 1048576 samples is 246.63
 Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.6347 (127.5 = random). Monte
 Carlo value for Pi is 3.132465868 (error 0.29 percent).
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
