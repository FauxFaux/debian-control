Description: Robust, reliable performance measurement and analysis; documentation
 This library provides a powerful but simple way to measure the performance of
 Haskell code.  It provides both a framework for executing and analysing
 benchmarks and a set of driver functions that makes it easy to build and run
 benchmarks, and to analyse their results.
 .
 The fastest way to get started is to read the documentation and examples in
 the Criterion.Main module.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
