Description: fast, pure and practical MD5 implementation; documentation
 A practical incremental and one-pass, pure API to the
 MD5 hash algorithm (including HMAC support) with performance close to
 the fastest implementations available in other languages.
 .
 The implementation is made in C with a haskell FFI wrapper that hides the C implementation.
 .
 NOTE: This package has been forked off cryptohash 0.11.7 because cryptohash
 has been deprecated.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
