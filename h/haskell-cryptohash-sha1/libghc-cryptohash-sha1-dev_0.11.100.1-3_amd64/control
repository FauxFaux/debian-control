Description: fast, pure and practical SHA-1 implementation
 A practical incremental and one-pass, pure API to the SHA-1 hash
 algorithm (including HMAC spuport) with performance close to the
 fastest implementations available in other languages.
 .
 The implementation is made in C with a haskell FFI wrapper that hides
 the C implementation.
 .
 NOTE: This package has been forked off cryptohash 0.11.7 because
 cryptohash has been deprecated.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
