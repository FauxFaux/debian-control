Description: fast, pure and practical SHA-256 implementation; profiling libraries
 A practical incremental and one-pass, pure API to the SHA-256 hash
 algorithm (including HMAC support) with performance close to the
 fastest implementations available in other languages.
 .
 The implementation is made in C with a haskell FFI wrapper that
 hides the C implementation.
 .
 NOTE: This package has been forked off cryptohash 0.11.7 because
 cryptohash has been deprecated.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
