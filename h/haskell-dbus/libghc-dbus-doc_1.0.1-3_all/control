Description: Haskell implementation of D-Bus; documentation
 D-Bus is a simple, message-based protocol for inter-process communication,
 which allows applications to interact with other parts of the machine and
 the user's session using remote procedure calls.
 .
 haskell-dbus is an implementation of the D-Bus protocol in Haskell. It can
 be used to add D-Bus support to Haskell applications, without the awkward
 interfaces common to foreign bindings.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
