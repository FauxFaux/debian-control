Description: Self-describing consumers/parsers; forms, cmd-line args, JSON, etc.; documentation
 There are a variety of Haskell libraries which are implementable
 through a common interface: self-describing parsers:
 .
  * A formlet is a self-describing parser.
  * A regular old text parser can be self-describing.
  * A command-line options parser is a self-describing parser.
  * A MUD command set is a self-describing parser.
  * A JSON API can be a self-describing parser.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
