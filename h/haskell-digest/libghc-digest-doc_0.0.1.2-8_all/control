Description: efficient cryptographic hash implementations bytestrings; documentation
 This package provides efficient cryptographic hash implementations for strict
 and lazy bytestrings. For now, CRC32 and Adler32 are supported; they are
 implemented as FFI bindings to efficient code from zlib.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
