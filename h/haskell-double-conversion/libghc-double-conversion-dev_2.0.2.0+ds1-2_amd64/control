Description: fast conversion between double precision floating point and text
 A library that performs fast, accurate conversion between double
 precision floating point and text.
 .
 This library is implemented as bindings to the C++
 double-conversion library written by Florian Loitsch at Google.
 .
 The 'Text' versions of these functions are about 30 times faster
 than the default 'show' implementation for the 'Double' type.
 .
 The 'ByteString' versions are /slower/ than the 'Text' versions;
 roughly half the speed.  (This seems to be due to the cost of
 allocating 'ByteString' values via malloc.)
 .
 As a final note, be aware that the bytestring-show package is
 about 50% slower than simply using 'show'.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
