Description: Rose trees with cached and accumulating monoidal annotations
 Rose (n-ary) trees with both upwards- (i.e. cached) and downwards-traveling
 (i.e. accumulating) monoidal annotations.
 .
 Abstractly, a DUALTree is a rose (n-ary) tree with data at leaves, data at
 internal nodes, and two types of monoidal annotations, one travelling "up" the
 tree and one traveling "down".
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
