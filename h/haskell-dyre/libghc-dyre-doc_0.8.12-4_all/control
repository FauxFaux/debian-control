Description: dynamic reconfiguration library; documentation
 Dyre implements dynamic reconfiguration facilities after the style
 of Xmonad. Dyre aims to be as simple as possible without sacrificing
 features, and places an emphasis on simplicity of integration with an
 application. A full introduction with a complete example project can
 be found in the documentation for Config.Dyre
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
