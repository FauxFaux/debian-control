Description: Cross-platform library for handling echoing terminal input
 The base library exposes the hGetEcho and hSetEcho functions
 for querying and setting echo status, but unfortunately, neither
 function works with MinTTY consoles on Windows. This is a serious
 issue, since hGetEcho and hSetEcho are often used to disable
 input echoing when a program prompts for a password, so many
 programs will reveal your password as you type it on MinTTY!
 .
 This library provides an alternative interface which works
 with both MinTTY and other consoles.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
