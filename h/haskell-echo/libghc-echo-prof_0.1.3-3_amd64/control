Description: Cross-platform library for handling echoing terminal input; profiling libraries
 The base library exposes the hGetEcho and hSetEcho functions
 for querying and setting echo status, but unfortunately, neither
 function works with MinTTY consoles on Windows. This is a serious
 issue, since hGetEcho and hSetEcho are often used to disable
 input echoing when a program prompts for a password, so many
 programs will reveal your password as you type it on MinTTY!
 .
 This library provides an alternative interface which works
 with both MinTTY and other consoles.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
