Description: documentation of the Edison Haskell library
 Some concrete implementations of the abstract interface of the Edison
 library for Haskell for use with hugs.
 .
 Edison is a library of purely function data structures for Haskell
 originally written by Chris Okasaki. Conceptually, it consists of two
 things:
   - A set of type classes defining data the following data structure
     abstractions: 'sequences', 'collections' and 'associative
     collections'
   - Multiple concrete implementations of each of the abstractions
 .
 This package contains the documentation of the concrete implementations.
