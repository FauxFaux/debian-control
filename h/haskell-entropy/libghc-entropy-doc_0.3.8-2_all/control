Description: cryptographically-strong entropy; documentation
 It is a platform-independent method to obtain cryptographically strong
 entropy (urandom on Linux, CryptAPI on Windows, patches welcome). Users
 looking for cryptographically strong (number-theoretically sound) PRNGs
 should see the DRBG package too.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
