Description: TH-generated EnumSet/EnumMap wrappers around IntSet/IntMap; profiling libraries
 This package wraps IntSet and IntMap from containers, and provides
 fast sets and maps keyed on any data type with a well-behaved Enum
 instance. Useful for derived Enums, newtype'd Ints, or any data type
 that can be packed into an Int: just implement fromEnum and toEnum.
 .
 The boilerplate is generated using Template Haskell, so unlike
 enummapset it's easier to maintain and keep up-to-date with
 containers. On the downside, it's less portable.
 .
 Note that "Data.EnumMap.Lazy" and "Data.EnumMap.Strict" provide distinct
 newtype wrappers, and their respective 'Functor' instances behave as
 expected, unlike that of IntMap which is alway lazy.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
