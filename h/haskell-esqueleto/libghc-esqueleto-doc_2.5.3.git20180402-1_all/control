Description: type-safe EDSL for SQL on persistent backends; documentation
 esqueleto is a bare bones, type-safe EDSL for SQL queries
 that works with unmodified persistent SQL backends.  Its
 language closely resembles SQL, so you don't have to learn
 new concepts, just new syntax, and it's fairly easy to
 predict the generated SQL and optimize it for your backend.
 Most kinds of errors committed when writing SQL are caught as
 compile-time errors---although it is possible to write
 type-checked esqueleto queries that fail at runtime.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
