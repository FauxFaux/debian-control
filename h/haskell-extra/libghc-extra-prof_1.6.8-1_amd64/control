Description: extra functions for base library; profiling libraries
 Library of extra functions for the standard Haskell libraries. Most
 functions are simple additions, filling out missing functionality. A
 few functions are available in later versions of GHC, but this
 package makes them available back to GHC 7.2.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
