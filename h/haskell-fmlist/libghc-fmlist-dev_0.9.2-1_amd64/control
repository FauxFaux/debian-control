Description: FoldMap lists
 FoldMap lists are lists represented by their foldMap function.
 FoldMap lists have O(1) cons, snoc and append, just like DLists,
 but other operations might have favorable performance
 characteristics as well. These wild claims are still completely
 unverified though.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
