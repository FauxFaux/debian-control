Description: FoldMap lists; documentation
 FoldMap lists are lists represented by their foldMap function.
 FoldMap lists have O(1) cons, snoc and append, just like DLists,
 but other operations might have favorable performance
 characteristics as well. These wild claims are still completely
 unverified though.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
