Description: composable, streaming, and efficient left folds; documentation
 This library provides strict left folds that stream in constant
 memory, and you can combine folds using Applicative style to derive
 new folds. Derived folds still traverse the container just once and
 are often as efficient as hand-written folds.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
