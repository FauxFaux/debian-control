Description: Generic Programming using True Sums of Products; documentation
 A library to support the definition of generic functions.
 Datatypes are viewed in a uniform, structured way:
 the choice between constructors is represented using an n-ary
 sum, and the arguments of each constructor are represented using
 an n-ary product.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
