Description: API library for working with Git repositories; documentation
 gitlib is a high-level, lazy and conduit-aware set of abstractions
 for programming with Git types. Several different backends are
 available, including one for the libgit2 C library. The aim is both
 type-safety and convenience of use for Haskell users, combined with
 high performance and minimal memory footprint by taking advantage of
 Haskell's laziness and the conduit library's deterministic resource
 cleanup.
 .
 For further information, as well as typical use cases, see the
 Git.Tutorial module.

 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
