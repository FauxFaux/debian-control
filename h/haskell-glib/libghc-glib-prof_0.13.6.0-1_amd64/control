Description: Binding to the GLIB library for Gtk2Hs; profiling libraries
 The GNU Library is a collection of C data structures and utility function for
 dealing with Unicode. This package only binds as much functionality as
 required to support the packages that wrap libraries that are themselves based
 on GLib.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
