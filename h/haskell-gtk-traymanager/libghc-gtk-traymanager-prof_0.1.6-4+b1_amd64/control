Description: bindings for eggtraymanager (GTK+); profiling libraries
 This package provides a wrapper around the prolific eggtraymanager code. Note
 that it is *NOT* itself a system tray widget, though it is a very convenient
 utility for implementing one.
 .
 This package adopts the style of gtk2hs and is designed to work well with it.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
