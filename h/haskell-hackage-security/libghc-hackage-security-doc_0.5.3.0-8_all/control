Description: Hackage security library; documentation
 The Hackage security library provides both server and client utilities
 for securing the Hackage package server.  It is based on The Update
 Framework, a set of recommendations developed by security researchers
 at various universities in the US as well as developers on the Tor
 project.
 .
 The current implementation supports only index signing,
 thereby enabling untrusted mirrors. It does not yet provide
 facilities for author package signing.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
