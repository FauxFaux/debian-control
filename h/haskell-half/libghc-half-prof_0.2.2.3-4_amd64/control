Description: half-precision floating-point; profiling libraries
 Half-precision floating point values with 1 bit of sign, 5 bits of
 exponent, 11 bits of mantissa trailing a leading 1 bit with proper
 underflow.
 .
 These arise commonly in GPU applications.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
