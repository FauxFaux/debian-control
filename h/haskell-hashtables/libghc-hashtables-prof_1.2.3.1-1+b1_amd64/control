Description: mutable hash tables -- profiling libraries; profiling libraries
 This package provides a couple of different implementations of mutable hash
 tables in the ST monad, as well as a typeclass abstracting their common
 operations, and a set of wrappers to use the hash tables in the IO monad.
 .
 There are three hash table implementations:
 .
  * Data.HashTable.ST.Basic contains a basic open-addressing hash table using
    linear probing as the collision strategy. This should currently be the
    fastest available hash table implementation for lookups, although it has a
    higher memory overhead than others.
  * Data.HashTable.ST.Cuckoo contains an implementation of "cuckoo hashing".
    Cuckoo hashing has worst-case O(1) lookups and performs well even when the
    table is highly loaded.
  * Data.HashTable.ST.Linear contains a linear hash table, which trades some
    insert and lookup performance for higher space efficiency and much shorter
    delays when expanding the table.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
