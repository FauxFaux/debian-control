Description: simple performant time-related library; profiling libraries
 Simple time library focusing on simple but powerful and performant API
 .
 The backbone of the library is the Timeable and Time type classes.
 .
 Each Timeable instances can be converted to type that has a Time
 instances, and thus are different representations of current time.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
