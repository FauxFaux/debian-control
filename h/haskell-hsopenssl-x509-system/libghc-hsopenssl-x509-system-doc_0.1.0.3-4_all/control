Description: use system's native CA certificate store with HsOpenSSL; documentation
 A cross-platform library that tries to find a (reasonable) CA certificate
 bundle that can be used with HsOpenSSL to verify the certificates of
 remote peers.
 .
 This package is for HsOpenSSL what x509-system is for the tls package.
 Additionally, it borrows some ideas from x509-system.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
