Description: partial OpenSSL binding for Haskell; profiling libraries
 HsOpenSSL is an OpenSSL binding for Haskell. It can generate RSA
 and DSA keys, read and write PEM files, generate message digests,
 sign and verify messages, encrypt and decrypt messages. It has
 also some capabilities of creating SSL clients and servers.
 .
 This package is in production use by a number of Haskell based
 systems and stable. You may also be interested in the tls package,
 which is a pure Haskell implementation of SSL.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
