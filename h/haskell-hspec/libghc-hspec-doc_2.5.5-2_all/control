Description: behavior-driven development for Haskell; documentation
 Hspec is roughly based on the Ruby library RSpec. However, Hspec is just
 a framework for running HUnit and QuickCheck tests. Compared to other
 options, it provides a much nicer syntax that makes tests very easy to read.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
