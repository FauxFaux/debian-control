Description: pure Haskell YAML 1.2 parser - library documentation
 HsYAML is a YAML 1.2 parser implementation for Haskell.
 .
 Features of @HsYAML@ include:
 .
  * Pure Haskell implementation with small dependency footprint
    and emphasis on strict compliance with the YAML 1.2 specification.
  * Direct decoding to native Haskell types
    via (aeson-inspired) typeclass-based API.
  * Support for constructing custom YAML node graph representation
    (including support for cyclic YAML data structures).
  * Support for the standard (untyped) Failsafe, (strict) JSON,
    and (flexible) Core "schemas" providing implicit typing rules
    as defined in the YAML 1.2 specification
    (including support for user-defined custom schemas).
  * Event-based API resembling LibYAML's Event-based API.
  * Low-level API access to lexical token-based scanner.
 .
 This package contains the library documentation for intern.
