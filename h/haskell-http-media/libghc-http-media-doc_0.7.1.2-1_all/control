Description: processing HTTP Content-Type and Accept headers; documentation
 This library is intended to be a comprehensive solution to parsing and
 selecting quality-indexed values in HTTP headers. It is capable of parsing
 both media types and language parameters from the Accept and Content header
 families, and can be extended to match against other accept headers as well.
 Selecting the appropriate header value is achieved by comparing a list of
 server options against the quality-indexed values supplied by the client.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
