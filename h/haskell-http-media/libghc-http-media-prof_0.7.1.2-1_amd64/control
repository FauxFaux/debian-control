Description: processing HTTP Content-Type and Accept headers; profiling libraries
 This library is intended to be a comprehensive solution to parsing and
 selecting quality-indexed values in HTTP headers. It is capable of parsing
 both media types and language parameters from the Accept and Content header
 families, and can be extended to match against other accept headers as well.
 Selecting the appropriate header value is achieved by comparing a list of
 server options against the quality-indexed values supplied by the client.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
