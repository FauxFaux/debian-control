Description: An HTTP client using io-streams; documentation
 This package provides an HTTP client, using the Snap Framework's 'io-streams'
 library to hande the streaming IO. The API is optimized for ease of use for
 the rather common case of code needing to query web services and deal with
 the result.
 .
 The library is exported in a single module; see "Network.Http.Client" for full
 documentation.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
