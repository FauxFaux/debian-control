Description: collection of tools for processing XML with Haskell; documentation
 The Haskell XML Toolbox bases on the ideas of HaXml and HXML, but introduces a
 more general approach for processing XML with Haskell.  The Haskell XML
 Toolbox uses a generic data model for representing XML documents, including
 the DTD subset and the document subset, in Haskell.  It contains a validating
 XML parser, a HTML parser, namespace support, an XPath expression evaluator,
 an XSLT library, a RelaxNG schema validator and funtions for serialization and
 deserialization of user defined data.  The library makes extensive use of the
 arrow approach for processing XML.
 .
 Since version 9 the toolbox is partitioned into various (sub-)packages.  This
 package contains the core functionality, hxt-curl, hxt-tagsoup, hxt-relaxng,
 hxt-xpath, hxt-xslt, hxt-regex-xmlschema contain the extensions.  hxt-unicode
 contains encoding and decoding functions, hxt-charproperties char properties
 for unicode and XML.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
