Description: key-value store in the IO monad; profiling libraries
 This library allows an application to extend the 'global state'
 hidden inside the IO monad with semi-arbitrary data. Data is
 required to be Typeable. The library provides an essentially
 unbounded number of key-value stores indexed by strings, with
 each key within the stores also being a string.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
