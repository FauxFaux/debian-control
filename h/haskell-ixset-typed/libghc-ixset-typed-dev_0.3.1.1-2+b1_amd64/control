Description: efficient relational queries on Haskell sets
 This Haskell package provides a data structure of sets that are indexed by
 potentially multiple indices.
 .
 Sets can be created, modified, and queried in various ways.
 .
 The package is a variant of the ixset package. The ixset package makes use of
 run-time type information to find a suitable index on a query, resulting in
 possible run-time errors when no suitable index exists. In ixset-typed, the
 types of all indices available or tracked in the type system.  Thus,
 ixset-typed should be safer to use than ixset, but in turn requires more GHC
 extensions.
 .
 At the moment, the two packages are relatively compatible. As a consequence of
 the more precise types, a few manual tweaks are necessary when switching from
 one to the other, but the interface is mostly the same.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
