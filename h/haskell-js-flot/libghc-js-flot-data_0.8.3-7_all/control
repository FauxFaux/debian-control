Description: bundles the jQuery Flot code into a Haskell package; runtime files
 This package bundles the minified jQuery Flot code into a Haskell
 package, so it can be depended upon by Cabal packages. The first
 three components of the version number match the upstream flot
 version. The haskell library is designed to meet the redistribution
 requirements of downstream users, and to reduce duplication of
 bundled code in Debian.
 .
 This package provides the runtime files needed by binaries which use
 the Haskell js-jflot library. See http://www.haskell.org/ for more
 information on Haskell.
