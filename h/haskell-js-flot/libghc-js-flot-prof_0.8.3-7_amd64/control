Description: bundles the jQuery Flot code into a Haskell package; profiling libraries
 This package bundles the minified jQuery Flot code into a Haskell
 package, so it can be depended upon by Cabal packages. The first
 three components of the version number match the upstream flot
 version. The haskell library is designed to meet the redistribution
 requirements of downstream users, and to reduce duplication of
 bundled code in Debian.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
