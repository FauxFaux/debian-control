Description: bundles the minified jQuery code into a Haskell package
 This package bundles the minified jQuery code into a Haskell package, so it can
 be depended upon by Cabal packages. The first three components of the version
 number match the upstream jQuery version. The haskell library is designed to
 meet the redistribution requirements of downstream users, and to reduce
 duplication of bundled code in Debian.
