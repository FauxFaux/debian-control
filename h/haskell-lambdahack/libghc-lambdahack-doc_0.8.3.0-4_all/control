Description: tactical squad ASCII roguelike dungeon crawler game engine; documentation
 LambdaHack is a Haskell game engine library for ASCII roguelike
 games of arbitrary theme, size and complexity, with optional
 tactical squad combat. It's packaged together with a sample
 dungeon crawler in fantasy setting that can be tried out
 as a native binary or in the browser at http://lambdahack.github.io.
 .
 Please see the changelog file for recent improvements
 and the issue tracker for short-term plans. Long term goals
 include multiplayer tactical squad combat, in-game content
 creation, auto-balancing and persistent content modification
 based on player behaviour. Contributions are welcome.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
