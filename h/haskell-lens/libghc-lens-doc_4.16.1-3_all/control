Description: Lenses, Folds and Traversals; documentation
 This package comes "Batteries Included" with many useful lenses for the types
 commonly used from the Haskell Platform, and with tools for automatically
 generating lenses and isomorphisms for user-supplied data types.
 .
 The combinators in Control.Lens provide a highly generic toolbox for composing
 families of getters, folds, isomorphisms, traversals, setters and lenses and
 their indexed variants.
 .
 More information on the care and feeding of lenses, including a tutorial and
 motivation for their types can be found on the lens wiki
 (https://github.com/ekmett/lens/wiki).
 .
 This package contains the documentation files.
