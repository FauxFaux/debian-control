Description: syntax sugar for defining maps; documentation
 Haskell's canonical list of tuples syntax for defining maps is not very
 convenient and also has ambiguous semantics.  This package leverages do
 notation to create a lighter syntax that makes semantics explicit and also
 allows the option of fail-fast handling of duplicate keys.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
