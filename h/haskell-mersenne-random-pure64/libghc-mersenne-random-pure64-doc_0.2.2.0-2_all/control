Description: Fast pure pseudorandom number generator; documentation
 The Mersenne twister is a pseudorandom number generator developed by Makoto
 Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura that is based on a matrix linear recurrence
 over a finite binary field. It provides for fast generation of very high
 quality pseudorandom numbers.
 .
 This library provides a purely functional binding to the 64 bit classic
 mersenne twister, along with instances of RandomGen, so the generator can be
 used with System.Random. The generator should typically be a few times faster
 than the default StdGen (but a tad slower than the impure 'mersenne-random'
 library based on SIMD instructions and destructive state updates.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
