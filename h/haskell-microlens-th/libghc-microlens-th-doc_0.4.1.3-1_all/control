Description: Automatic generation of record lenses for microlens; documentation
 This package lets you automatically generate lenses for data types; code was
 extracted from the lens package, and therefore generated lenses are fully
 compatible with ones generated by lens (and can be used both from lens and
 microlens).
 .
 This package is a part of the microlens family.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
