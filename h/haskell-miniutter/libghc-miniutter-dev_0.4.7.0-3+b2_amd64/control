Description: simple English clause creation from arbitrary words
 This library helps in generating simple present tense
 English sentences from short, parameterized descriptions.
 In a typical use, the structure of a clause is fixed,
 but the particular words to be used vary in arbitrary ways.
 The main goal of the library is to minimize the API
 complexity and the code size of programs that use it.
 The library doesn't attempt to ban incorrect English sentences,
 but just make the creation of the simple correct ones easy
 and predictable.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
