Description: Memory mapped files for POSIX and Windows; documentation
 This library provides a wrapper to mmap(2) or MapViewOfFile, allowing files or
 devices to be lazily loaded into memory as strict or lazy ByteStrings,
 ForeignPtrs or plain Ptrs, using the virtual memory subsystem to do on-demand
 loading. Modifications are also supported.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
