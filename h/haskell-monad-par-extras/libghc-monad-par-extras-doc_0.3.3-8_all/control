Description: Combinators and extra features for Par monads; documentation
 The Par monad offers a simple API for parallel programming. The library works
 for parallelising both pure and IO computations, although only the pure
 version is deterministic. The default implementation provides a work-stealing
 scheduler and supports forking tasks that are much lighter weight than
 IO-threads.
 .
 This package provides combinators and extra features for Par monads.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
