Description: parallel programming based on a monad; documentation
 This library offers an alternative parallel programming API to that
 provided by the parallel package. The Par monad allows the simple
 description of parallel computations, and can be used to add
 parallelism to pure Haskell code. The basic API is straightforward:
 the monad supports forking and simple communication in terms of IVars.
 .
 The library comes with an efficient work-stealing implementation, but
 the internals are also exposed so that you can build your own scheduler
 if necessary.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
