Description: Typeclass and set of functions for working with newtypes; documentation
 Per Conor McBride, the Newtype typeclass represents the packing and unpacking
 of a newtype, and allows you to operatate under that newtype with functions
 such as ala.  Generics support was added in version 0.4, making this package a
 full replacement for the original newtype package, and a better alternative to
 newtype-th.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
