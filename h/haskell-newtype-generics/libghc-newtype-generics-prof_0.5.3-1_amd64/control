Description: Typeclass and set of functions for working with newtypes; profiling libraries
 Per Conor McBride, the Newtype typeclass represents the packing and unpacking
 of a newtype, and allows you to operatate under that newtype with functions
 such as ala.  Generics support was added in version 0.4, making this package a
 full replacement for the original newtype package, and a better alternative to
 newtype-th.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
