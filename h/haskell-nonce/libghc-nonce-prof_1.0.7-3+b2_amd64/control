Description: generate cryptographic nonces; profiling libraries
  According to the Wikipedia, a nonce is an arbitrary number used
 only once in a cryptographic communication.  This package
 contain helper functions for generating nonces.
 .
 There are many kinds of nonces used in different situations.
 It's not guaranteed that by using the nonces from this package
 you won't have any security issues.  Please make sure that the
 nonces generated via this package are usable on your design.
  .
  This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
