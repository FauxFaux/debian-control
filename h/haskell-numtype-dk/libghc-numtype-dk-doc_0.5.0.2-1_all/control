Description: type-level integers without fundeps; documentation
 This package provides type level representations of the
 (positive and negative) integers and basic operations (addition,
 subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation) on these.
 The numtype-dk package differs from the numtype package in that
 the NumTypes are implemented using Data Kinds, TypeNats, and
 Closed Type Families rather than Functional Dependencies.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
