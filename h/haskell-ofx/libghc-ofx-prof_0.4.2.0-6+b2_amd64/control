Description: parser for Open Financial Exchange (OFX) financial data; profiling libraries
 A parser for Open Financial Exchange (OFX) financial data. This
 handles OFX version 1.03, which is documented at http://www.ofx.net/ .
 This also handles QFX, which is OFX plus some minor additions made by
 Intuit, the publishers of Quicken.
 .
 The parser will place all the data into a tree, which you can query
 for whatever data you may need, although you will need to be familiar
 with the OFX spec to do this. There is also a Transaction type which
 you can easily parse from the tree; this will contain most, if not
 all, of the data you will be interested in if your OFX file is from a
 bank or credit card account.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
