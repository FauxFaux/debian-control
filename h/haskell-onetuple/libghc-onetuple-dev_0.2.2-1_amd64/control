Description: singleton tuple
 OneTuple fills the tuple gap with a singleton tuple.
 .
 OneTuple does not support the usual parenthesized tuple syntax.
 .
 OneTuple
  * has the expected laziness properties
  * can be pattern-matched
  * ships with instances for several standard type classes, including
    all those supported by H98-standard tuples
  * requires no language extensions, except for hierarchical modules
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
