Description: implementation of difficult monads made easy with operational semantics; documentation
 This library makes it easy to implement monads with tricky control
 flow.
 .
 This is useful for: writing web applications in a sequential style,
 programming games with a uniform interface for human and AI players
 and easy replay capababilities, implementing fast parser monads,
 designing monadic DSLs, etc.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
