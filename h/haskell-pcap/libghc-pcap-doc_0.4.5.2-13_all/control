Description: Haskell wrapper around the C libpcap library; documentation
 This library provides Haskell bindings for most of the libpcap API as of
 libpcap version 0.9.7. The bindings are divided into a very efficient
 low-level wrapper, Network.Pcap.Base, and a higher-level module, Network.Pcap,
 that's easier to use.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
