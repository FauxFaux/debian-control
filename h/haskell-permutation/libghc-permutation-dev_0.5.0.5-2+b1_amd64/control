Description: library for permutations and combinations
 This library includes data types for storing permutations and
 combinations.  It implements pure and impure types, the latter of
 which can be modified in-place.  The library uses aggressive
 inlining and MutableByteArray#s internally, so it is very
 efficient.
 .
 The main utility of the library is converting between the linear
 representation of a permutation and a sequence of swaps.  This
 allows, for instance, applying a permutation or its inverse
 to an array with O(1) memory use.
 .
 Much of the interface for the library is based on the permutation
 and combination functions in the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
