Description: group streams into substreams; profiling libraries
 pipes-group uses FreeT and lenses to group streams into sub-streams.
 Notable features include:
  * Perfect Streaming: Group elements without collecting them into memory
  * Lens Support: Use lenses to simplify many common operations
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
