Description: safety for the pipes ecosystem; documentation
 This package adds resource management and exception handling to the
 pipes ecosystem.
 .
 Notable features include:
 .
  * Resource Safety: Guarantee finalization using `finally`, `bracket`
    and more
  * Exception Safety: Even against asynchronous exceptions!
  * Laziness: Only acquire resources when you need them
  * Promptness: Finalize resources early when you are done with them
  * Native Exception Handling: Catch and resume from exceptions
    inside pipes
  * No Buy-in: Mix resource-safe pipes with unmanaged pipes using
    `hoist`
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
