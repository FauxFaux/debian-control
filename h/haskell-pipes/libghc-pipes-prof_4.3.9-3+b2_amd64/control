Description: compositional pipelines; profiling libraries
 pipes is a clean and powerful stream processing library that lets you
 build and connect reusable streaming components
 .
 Advantages over traditional streaming libraries:
  * Concise API: Use simple commands like for, (>->), await, and yield
  * Blazing fast: Implementation tuned for speed
  * Lightweight Dependency: pipes is small and compiles very rapidly,
    including dependencies
  * Elegant semantics: Use practical category theory
  * ListT: Correct implementation of ListT that interconverts with pipes
  * Bidirectionality: Implement duplex channels
  * Extensive Documentation: Second to none!
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
