Description: haskell types and functions for working with polynomials; profiling libraries
 A haskell library providing a type for representing polynomials,
 several functions for manipulating and evaluating them, and several
 interesting polynomial sequences.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
