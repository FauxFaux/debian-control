Description: interact with pseudoterminals using subprocesses; documentation
 This Haskell library permits programs to interact with
 pseudoterminals, where those pseudoterminals are represented as
 subprocesses.  There are functions available to read and write to the
 terminals, and to resize them.
 .
 See pty(7) for more information on pseudoterminals.

 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
