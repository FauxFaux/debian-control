Description: interact with pseudoterminals using subprocesses; profiling libraries
 This Haskell library permits programs to interact with
 pseudoterminals, where those pseudoterminals are represented as
 subprocesses.  There are functions available to read and write to the
 terminals, and to resize them.
 .
 See pty(7) for more information on pseudoterminals.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
