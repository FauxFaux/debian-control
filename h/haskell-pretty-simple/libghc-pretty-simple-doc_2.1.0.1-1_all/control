Description: pretty printer for data types with a 'Show' instance; documentation
 Features:
  * Easy-to-read
   - Complex data types are simple to understand.
  * Color
   - Prints in color using ANSI escape codes.
   - It is possible to print without color by using the pPrintNoColor
     function
  * Rainbow Parentheses
   - Easy to understand deeply nested data types
  * Configurable Indentation
   - Amount of indentation is configurable with the pPrintOpt function
  * Fast
   - No problem pretty-printing data types thousands of lines long
  * Works with any data type with a Show instance
   - Some common Haskell data types have a Show instance that produces
     non-valid Haskell code. pretty-simple will pretty-print even these
     data types
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
