Description: convert documents between ansi-wl-pprint and prettyprinter; documentation
 This package defines a converter from the old ansi-wl-pprint document
 type to the new prettyprinter one. Its purpose is making packages
 that only generate ansi-wl-pprint data available to the prettyprinter
 ecosystem.
 .
 Note the difference to the prettyprinter-compat-ansi-wl-pprint
 package, which does not convert any data, and instead provides an API
 that mimics ansi-wl-pprint, while secretly being prettyprinter-based
 behind the curtains. This package on the other hand does a proper
 conversion.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
