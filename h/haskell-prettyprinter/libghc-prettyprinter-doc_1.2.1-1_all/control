Description: modern, easy-to-use, extensible prettyprinter; documentation
 Haskell, more specifically Hackage, has a zoo of Wadler/Leijen based
 prettyprinters already. Each of them addresses a different concern
 with the classic wl-pprint package. This package solves all these
 issues, and then some:
  * Text instead of String
  * No name clashes
  * Annotation support
  * Extensible backends
  * Performance
  * Open implementation
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
