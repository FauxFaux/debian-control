Description: Google Protocol Buffers for Haskell; documentation
 Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an
 efficient yet extensible format.  This is an implementation of a
 subset of Google Protocol Buffers for Haskell.
 .
 Record specifications are built by defining records with specially
 defined fields that capture most of the Protocol Buffers
 specification language.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
