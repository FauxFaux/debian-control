Description: Haskell bindings for libqrencode; profiling libraries
 Libqrencode is a C library for encoding data in a QR Code symbol, a kind
 of 2D symbology that can be scanned by handy terminals such as a mobile
 phone with CCD. The capacity of QR Code is up to 7000 digits or 4000
 characters, and is highly robust.
 .
 This package provides Haskell bindings for libqrencode.
