Description: Safe reimplementation of QuickCheck's core; documentation
 QuickCheck-safe reimplements the quickCheck functionality with a pure
 interface and a very small trusted base (see Test.QuickCheck.Safe.Trusted).
 .
 * uses the existing Arbitrary instances
 * implemented features: testing, result minimization (i.e., shrinking)
 * missing features: expected failures, label frequencies, coverage
 .
 The package is targeted at users who want to leverage SafeHaskell for
 sandboxing.

 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
