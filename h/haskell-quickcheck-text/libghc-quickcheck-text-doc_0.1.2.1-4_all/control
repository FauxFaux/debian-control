Description: alternative arbitrary instance for Text; documentation
 The usual Arbitrary instance for Text (in quickcheck-instances) only
 has single-byte instances and so isn't an ideal representation of a
 valid UTF-8 character. This package has generators for one-, two- and
 three-byte UTF-8 characters (all that are currently in use).
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
