Description: Generator and shrink functions for testing Unicode-related software.; documentation
 The default Arbitrary instance for the Char type intentionally generates only
 ASCII values. This can lead to a false sense of security in cases where
 Unicode compliance is required, as encodings that span multiple bytes or code
 units will simply not be exercised at all.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
