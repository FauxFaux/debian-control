Description: rate-limiting IO actions
 In many cases, it is useful, necessary, or simply nice to limit how
 frequently you perform some action. For example, you may want to limit
 how often your program makes a request of some web site. This library
 is intended as a general-purpose mechanism for rate-limiting IO actions.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
