Description: Library for functional reactive programming (FRP); documentation
 Reactive-banana is a library for Functional Reactive Programming (FRP).
 .
 FRP offers an elegant and concise way to express interactive programs
 such as graphical user interfaces, animations, computer music or
 robot controllers. It promises to avoid the spaghetti code that is
 all too common in traditional approaches to GUI programming.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
