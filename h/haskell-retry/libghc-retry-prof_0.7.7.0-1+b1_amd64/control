Description: Retry combinators for monadic actions that may fail; profiling libraries
 This package exposes combinators that can wrap arbitrary monadic actions. They
 run the action and potentially retry running it with some configurable delay
 for a configurable number of times.
 .
 The purpose is to make it easier to work with IO and especially network IO
 actions that often experience temporary failure and warrant retrying of the
 original action. For example, a database query may time out for a while, in
 which case we should hang back for a bit and retry the query instead of simply
 raising an exception.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
