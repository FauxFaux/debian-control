Description: implementation of RSA, using padding schemes of PKCS#1 v2.1.; documentation
 This library implements the RSA encryption and signature algorithms for
 arbitrarily-sized ByteStrings. While the implementations work, they are not
 necessarily the fastest ones on the planet. Particularly key generation. The
 algorithms included are based of RFC 3447, or the Public-Key Cryptography
 Standard for RSA, version 2.1 (a.k.a, PKCS#1 v2.1).
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
