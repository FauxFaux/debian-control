Description: random variables; profiling libraries
 Random number generation based on modeling random variables by an
 abstract type (RVar) which can be composed and manipulated
 monadically and sampled in either monadic or "pure" styles.
 .
 The primary purpose of this library is to support defining and
 sampling a wide variety of high quality random variables. Quality is
 prioritized over speed, but performance is an important goal too.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
