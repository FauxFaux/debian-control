Description: send textual messages to a Handle in a thread-friendly way; documentation
 When writing a line to a Handle,
 .
  * Properly handle character encoding settings on the Handle
  * For reasonably sized messages, ensure that the entire message
    is written in one chunk to avoid interleaving data with other threads
  * This includes the trailing newline character
  * Avoid unnecessary memory allocations and copies
  * Minimize locking
  * Provide a simple API
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
