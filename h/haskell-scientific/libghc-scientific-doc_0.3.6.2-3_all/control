Description: scientific notation for floating-point numbers; documentation
 This package provides a Haskell datatype for representing and pretty-printing
 arbitrary-precision numbers using scientific notation.
 .
 Its primary use-case is to serve as the target of parsing floating point
 numbers. Since the textual representation of floating point numbers use
 scientific notation they can be efficiently parsed to a Scientific number.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
