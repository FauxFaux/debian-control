Description: Haskell SDL gfx binding for GHC - profiling libraries
 This package provides the SDL gfx library bindings for the Haskell
 programming language, compiled for profiling. SDL gfx is an extension
 to the SDL library which provides basic antialiased drawing routines
 such as lines, circles or polygons, an interpolating rotozoomer for SDL
 surfaces, framerate control and MMX image filters.
