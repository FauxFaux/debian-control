Description: minimalist web framework for the WAI server interface; documentation
 Simple is a "framework-less" web framework for Haskell web applications
 based on the WAI server interface (f.ex. for use with the warp server).
 Simple does not enforce a particular structure or paradigm for web
 applications. Rather, Simple contains tools to help you create your own
 patterns (or re-create existing ones). Simple is minimalist, providing a
 lightweight base - the most basic Simple app is little more than a WAI
 'Application' with some routing logic. Everything else (f.ex. authentication,
 controllers, persistence, caching, etc.) is provided in composable units, so
 you can include only the ones you need in your app, and easily replace
 them with your own components.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
