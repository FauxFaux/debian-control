Description: Haskell framework for generating singleton types; documentation
 This library generates singleton types, promoted functions, and singleton
 functions using Template Haskell. It is useful for programmers who wish
 to use dependently typed programming techniques. The library was originally
 presented in /Dependently Typed Programming with Singletons/, published
 at the Haskell Symposium, 2012.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
