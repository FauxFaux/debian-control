Description: syntax highlighting library; documentation
 Skylighting is a syntax highlighting library. It derives its tokenizers
 from XML syntax definitions used by KDE's KSyntaxHighlighting framework,
 so any syntax supported by that framework can be added. An optional
 command-line program is provided. Skylighting is intended to be the
 successor to highlighting-kate.
 .
 This package provides the core highlighting functionality under a permissive
 license. It also bundles XML parser definitions licensed under the GPL.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
