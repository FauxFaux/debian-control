Description: syntax highlighting tool
 Skylighting is a syntax highlighting library with
 support for over one hundred languages.  It derives
 its tokenizers from XML syntax definitions used
 by KDE's KSyntaxHighlighting framework, so any
 syntax supported by that framework can be added.
 An optional command-line program is provided.
 Skylighting is intended to be the successor to
 highlighting-kate.
 .
 This is a command-line tool that can output HTML and LaTeX.
