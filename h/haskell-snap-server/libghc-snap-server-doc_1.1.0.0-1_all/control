Description: iteratee-based, epoll-enabled web server for the Snap Framework; documentation
 Snap is a simple and fast web development framework and server written in
 Haskell. For more information or to download the latest version, you can
 visit the Snap project website at <http://snapframework.com/>.
 .
 The Snap HTTP server is a high performance, epoll-enabled, iteratee-based web
 server library written in Haskell. Together with the @snap-core@ library upon
 which it depends, it provides a clean and efficient Haskell programming
 interface to the HTTP protocol.
 .
 Higher-level facilities for building web applications (like user/session
 management, component interfaces, data modeling, etc.) are planned but not
 yet implemented, so this release will mostly be of interest for those who:
 .
 o need a fast and minimal HTTP API at roughly the same level of abstraction
 as Java servlets, or
 .
 o are interested in contributing to the Snap Framework project.
 .
 This package contains the documentation files.
