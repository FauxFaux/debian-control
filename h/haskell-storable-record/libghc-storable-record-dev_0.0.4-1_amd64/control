Description: elegant definition of Storable instances for records
 With this package you can build a Storable instance of a record type
 from Storable instances of its elements in an elegant way.
 It does not do any magic, just a bit arithmetic to compute the right
 offsets that would be otherwise done manually or by a preprocessor
 like C2HS.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
