Description: Generic programming library for Haskell; profiling libraries
 This package contains the generics system known as "Scrap Your Boilerplate".
 It defines the "Data" class of types permitting folding and unfolding of
 constructor applications, instances of this class for primitive types, and a
 variety of traversals.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
