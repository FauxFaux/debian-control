Description: toy module to temporarily redirect a program's stdout; documentation
 Due to the design of POSIX, it is possible to temporarily overload the
 file descriptors corresponding to stdout and stderr to point to an
 arbitrary pipe. It is, however, tricky to get right. This module gets
 it right, as far as such a terrible hack can be made right. It can be
 used to make misbehaving third-party C libraries stop spewing to
 standard output.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
