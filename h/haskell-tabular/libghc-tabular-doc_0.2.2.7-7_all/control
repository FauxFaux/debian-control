Description: two-dimensional data tables with rendering functions; documentation
 Tabular provides a Haskell representation of two-dimensional data
 tables, the kind that you might find in a spreadsheet or a
 research report. It also comes with some default rendering functions
 for turning those tables into ASCII art, simple text with an
 arbitrary delimiter, CSV, HTML or LaTeX.
 .
 The tabular package can group rows and columns, each group having one
 of three separators (no line, single line, double line) between its
 members.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
