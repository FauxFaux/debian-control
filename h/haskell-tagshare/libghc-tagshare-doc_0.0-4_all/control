Description: explicit sharing with tags; documentation
 TagShare supplies a monad for sharing values based on tags
 and types. Each tag and type is bound to at most one value
 in a dynamic map.
 .
 The principal use of this package is to ensure that
 constant class members or other overloaded values are
 shared.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
