Description: Golden test support for Tasty test framework; documentation
 This library provides support for golden testing. A golden test is an
 IO action that writes its result to a file. To pass the test, this
 output file should be identical to the corresponding golden file,
 which contains the correct result for the test.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
