Description: string substitution library; documentation
 This is a simple string substitution library that supports "$"-based
 substitution. It is meant to be used when Text.Printf or string concatenation
 would lead to code that is hard to read but when a full blown templating
 system is overkill.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
