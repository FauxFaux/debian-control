Description: A simple progress bar in the terminal; documentation
 A progress bar is used to convey the progress of a task. This
 package implements a very simple textual progress bar.
 .
 The animated progress bar depends entirely on the interpretation of
 the carriage return character (\'\r\'). If your terminal interprets
 it as something else then "move cursor to beginning of line", the
 animation won't work.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
