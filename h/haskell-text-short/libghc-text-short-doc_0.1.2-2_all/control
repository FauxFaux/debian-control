Description: memory-efficient representation of Unicode text strings; documentation
 This Haskell library provides the 'ShortText' type which is suitable
 for keeping many short strings in memory. This is similiar to the
 relationship between 'ShortByteString' and 'ByteString'.
 .
 The main differences between 'Text' and 'ShortText' is that
 'ShortText' uses UTF-8 instead of UTF-16 internally and 'ShortText'
 doesn't support zero-copy slicing (thereby saving 2 words).
 Consequently, the memory footprint of a (boxed) 'ShortText' value is 4
 words (2 words when unboxed) plus the length of the UTF-8 encoded
 payload.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
