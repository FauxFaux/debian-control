Description: high-quality splittable pseudorandom number generator; documentation
 This package contains an implementation of a high-quality splittable
 pseudorandom number generator. The generator is based on a cryptographic hash
 function built on top of the ThreeFish block cipher. See the paper Splittable
 Pseudorandom Number Generators Using Cryptographic Hashing by Claessen, Pa≈Çka
 for details and the rationale of the design.
 .
 The package provides the following:
 .
  * A splittable PRNG that implements the standard System.Random.RandomGen class.
 .
  * The generator also implements an alternative version of the
    System.Random.TF.Gen.RandomGen class (exported from System.Random.TF.Gen),
    which requires the generator to return pseudorandom integers from the full
    32-bit range, and contains an n-way split function.
 .
  * An alternative version of the Random class is provided, which is linked to
    the new RandomGen class, together with Random instances for some integral
    types.
 .
  * Two functions for initialising the generator with a non-deterministic
    seed: one using the system time, and one using the /dev/urandom UNIX
    special file.
 .
 Please note that even though the generator provides very high-quality
 pseudorandom numbers, it has not been designed with cryptographic applications
 in mind.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
