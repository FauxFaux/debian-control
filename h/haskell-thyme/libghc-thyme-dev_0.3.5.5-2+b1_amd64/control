Description: faster time library
 Thyme is a rewrite of the fine time library, with a particular focus
 on performance for applications that make heavy use of timestamps. For
 example, UTCTime is represented with Î¼s precision as an Int64, which
 gives a usable range from -290419-11-07 19:59:05.224192 UTC to
 294135-11-26 04:00:54.775807 UTC in the future.
 .
 Conversions are provided as Iso's from the lens package, while
 AdditiveGroup, VectorSpace and AffineSpace from vector-space allow for
 more principled operations instead of Num, Fractional & al.
 .
 Thyme uses strict and unpacked tuples throughout, e.g. YearMonthDay or
 WeekDate. Descriptive Int synonyms such as Year and DayOfMonth are
 also provided.
 .
 On platforms where Int is 64-bits wide, types with an Enum instance
 can be used as Keys for IntMap, preferably via the EnumMap wrapper
 provided by enummapset-th. In any case the Ord instances are much
 faster, if you must use Map.
 .
 Data.Thyme.Time is a drop-in compatibility module for existing code.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
