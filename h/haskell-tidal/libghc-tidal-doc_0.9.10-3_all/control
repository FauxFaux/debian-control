Description: pattern language for improvised music; documentation
 TidalCycles (or Tidal for short) is a domain-specific language for
 live coding patterns.  It allows you to make musical patterns with
 text, describing sequences and ways of transforming and combining
 them, exploring complex interactions between simple parts.
 .
 Tidal allows you to express music with very flexible timing, providing
 a little language for describing patterns as step sequences (which
 can be polyphonic and polymetric), some generators of continuous
 patterns (e.g. sinewaves, sawtooths) and a wide range of pattern
 transformations.
 .
 Tidal is highly composable in that pattern transformations can be
 easily combined together, allowing you to quickly create complex
 patterns from simple ingredients.
 .
 Tidal does not make sound itself, but is designed for use with the
 SuperDirt synth, and can control other synths over Open Sound Control
 or MIDI.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
