Description: basic library for defining units of time as types; documentation
 In many cases, it is useful (either for error checking or documentation
 reasons) to define input and output types as having a particular unit of
 time. In addition, by creating a type class defining type units, this
 library should make it easier to separate the units of time the developer
 wants to think in versus the units of time the library author wants to
 think in.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
