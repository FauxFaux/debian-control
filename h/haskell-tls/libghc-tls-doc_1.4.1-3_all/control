Description: native Haskell implementation of TLS/SSL protocol; documentation
 Native Haskell TLS and SSL protocol implementation for server and
 client.
 .
 This provides a high-level implementation of a sensitive security
 protocol, eliminating a common set of security issues through the use
 of the advanced type system, high level constructions and common
 Haskell features.
 .
 It currently implements the SSL3.0, TLS1.0, TLS1.1 and TLS1.2
 protocols, and supports RSA and Ephemeral (Elliptic curve and
 regular) Diffie Hellman key exchanges, and many extensions.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
