Description: run external processes, with strong typing of streams; profiling libraries
 This library provides the ability to launch and interact with
 external processes. It wraps around the process library, and intends
 to improve upon it by:
 .
  * Using type variables to represent the standard streams, making
    them easier to manipulate
  * Use proper concurrency (e.g., the async library) in place of the
    weird lazy I/O tricks for such things as consuming output streams
  * Allow for more complex concurrency by providing STM-based functions
  * Using binary I/O correctly
  * Providing a more composable API, designed to be easy to use for
    both simple and complex use cases
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
