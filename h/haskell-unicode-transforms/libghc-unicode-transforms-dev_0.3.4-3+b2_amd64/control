Description: Fast Unicode 9.0 normalization in Haskell
 Unicode characters with adornments (e.g. Á) can be represented in two
 different forms, as a single composed character (U+00C1 = Á) or as
 multiple decomposed characters (U+0041(A) U+0301( ́ ) = Á). They are
 differently encoded byte sequences but for humans they have exactly
 the same visual appearance.
 .
 A regular byte comparison may tell that two strings are different even
 though they might be equivalent. Both strings need to be converted in
 a normalized form using the Unicode Character Database before they can
 be compared for equivalence.
 .
 This library implements fast Unicode 9.0 normalization in Haskell (NFC,
 NFKC, NFD, NFKD).
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
