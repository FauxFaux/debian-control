Description: typed, persistent store for values of arbitrary types; documentation
 A vault is a typed, persistent store for values of arbitrary types. It's
 like having first-class access to the storage space behind IORefs.
 .
 The data structure is analogous to a bank vault, where you can access
 different bank boxes with different keys; hence the name.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
 See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
