Description: instances of Data.Binary and Data.Serialize for vector; documentation
  This package provides instances for Binary for the types defined in the
  vector package, making it easy to serialize vectors to and from disk. It uses
  the generic interface to vectors, so all vector types are supported.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
