Description: instances of Data.Binary and Data.Serialize for vector; profiling libraries
  This package provides instances for Binary for the types defined in the
  vector package, making it easy to serialize vectors to and from disk. It uses
  the generic interface to vectors, so all vector types are supported.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
