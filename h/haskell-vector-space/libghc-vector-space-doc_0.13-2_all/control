Description: Vector & affine spaces, linear maps, and derivatives library; documentation
 vector-space provides classes and generic operations for vector spaces
 and affine spaces. It also defines a type of infinite towers of generalized
 derivatives. A generalized derivative is a linear transformation rather than
 one of the common concrete representations (scalars, vectors, matrices, ...).
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
