Description: functions for Word8s to be used with ByteStrings; profiling libraries
 This is a Word8 library to be used with Data.ByteString. All function
 assumes that Word8 is encoded in Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1). All utility
 functions are supposed to work as if those of Char. Exceptions are
 described in the function documentations.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
