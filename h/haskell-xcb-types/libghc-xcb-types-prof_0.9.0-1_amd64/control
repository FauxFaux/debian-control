Description: parses XML files used by the XCB project; profiling libraries
 This package provides types which mirror the structures used in the XCB code
 generation XML files.
 .
 See project http://xcb.freedesktop.org/ for more information about the XCB
 project.
 .
 The XML files describe the data-types, events and requests used by the X
 Protocol, and are used to auto-generate large parts of the XCB project.
 .
 This package parses these XML files into Haskell data structures.
 .
 If you want to do something with these XML descriptions but don't want to
 learn XSLT, this package should help.
 .
 This version of xcb-types is intended to fully parse the X Protocol
 description version 1.4.
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
