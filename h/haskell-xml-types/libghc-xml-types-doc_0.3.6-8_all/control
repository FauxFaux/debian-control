Description: basic types for representing XML; documentation
 The idea is to have a full set of appropriate types, which various
 XML libraries can share. Instead of having equivalent-but-incompatible
 types for every binding, parser, or client, they all share the same
 types can thus interoperate easily.
 .
 This library contains complete types for most parts of an XML
 document, including the prologue, node tree, and doctype. Some basic
 combinators are included for common tasks, including traversing the
 node tree and filtering children.
 .
 This package provides the documentation for a library for the Haskell
 programming language.
