Description: XML parser and renderer with HTML 5 quirks mode
 Contains renderers and parsers for both XML and HTML 5 document
 fragments, which share data structures so that it's easy to work with
 both. Document fragments are bits of documents, which are not
 constrained by some of the high-level structure rules (in particular,
 they may contain more than one root element).
 .
 Note that this is not a compliant HTML 5 parser. Rather, it is a
 parser for HTML 5 compliant documents. It does not implement the HTML
 5 parsing algorithm, and should generally be expected to perform
 correctly only on documents that you trust to conform to HTML 5. This
 is not a suitable library for implementing web crawlers or other
 software that will be exposed to documents from outside sources. The
 result is also not the HTML 5 node structure, but rather something
 closer to the physical structure. For example, omitted start tags are
 not inserted (and so, their corresponding end tags must also be
 omitted).
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language.
