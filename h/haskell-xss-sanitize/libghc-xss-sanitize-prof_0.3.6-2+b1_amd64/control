Description: Library to sanitize HTML and prevent XSS attacks; profiling libraries
 This library is able to parse strings that contain HTML code and check
 for the presence of potentially malicious tags that could trigger XSS
 (Cross-Site Scripting). It can be used in a Web application when using
 HTML code coming from an untrusted party.
 .
 Moreover, this library is also able to check for unbalanced tags and
 tries to fix them (even though it could produce invalid HTML).
 .
 This package provides a library for the Haskell programming language, compiled
 for profiling.  See http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on Haskell.
