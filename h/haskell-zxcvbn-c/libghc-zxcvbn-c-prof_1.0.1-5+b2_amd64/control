Description: Haskell bindings to password strength estimation library; profiling libraries
 This library provides Haskell bindings to a C/C++ implementation of
 the zxcvbn password strength estimator.  It provides a function to
 rate password strength, by comparing the password to several word
 lists, including English first and last names.
