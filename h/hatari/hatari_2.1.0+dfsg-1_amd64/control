Description: Emulator for the Atari ST, STE, TT, and Falcon computers
 Hatari is an emulator for the Atari ST line of computers.
 .
 The Atari ST was a 16/32 bit computer system which was first released by
 Atari in 1985. Using the Motorola 68000 CPU, it was a very popular computer
 having quite a lot of CPU power at that time.
 .
 Unlike many other Atari ST emulators which try to give you a good environment
 for running GEM applications, Hatari tries to emulate the hardware of a ST as
 close as possible so that it is able to run most of the old ST games and
 demos.
