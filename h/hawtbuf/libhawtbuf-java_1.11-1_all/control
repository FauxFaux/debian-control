Description: HawtBuf rich byte buffer library
 The HawtBuf library implements a simple interface with working with
 byte arrays. The JDK doesn't come with a built in class that's simply
 a `byte[]`, `int offset`, `int length` class and providing a rich
 interface similar to what the String class does for `char` arrays.
 HawtBuf fills in that void by providing a Buffer class which does
 provide that rich interface.
 .
 HawtBuf also provides a Java protobuf code generator to make it easy
 to encode and decode objects to buffers and back.
