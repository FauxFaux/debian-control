Description: HDAPS daemon for various laptops with motion sensors
 This is a disk protection user-space daemon. It monitors the acceleration
 values through an interface and automatically initiates disk head parking
 if a fall or sliding of the laptop is detected.
 .
 Currently, the follwowing interfaces are supported:
  * IBM/Lenovo ThinkPad (HDAPS)
  * Apple iBook/PowerBook (AMS)
  * Apple MacBook/MacBook Pro (APPLESMC)
  * HP (HP3D)
  * Dell (FREEFALL)
  * Toshiba (ACPI and HAPS)
  * Acer (INPUT)
 .
 On ThinkPads, it is recommended that you use this daemon with the hdaps
 module provided by tp-smapi rather the one in the kernel, as this will save
 you a bit of power and will work on a wider range of ThinkPads.
