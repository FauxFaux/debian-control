Description: tune hard disk parameters for high performance
 Get/set device parameters for Linux SATA/IDE drives.
 Provides a command line interface to various kernel interfaces supported by
 the Linux SATA/PATA/SAS "libata" subsystem and the older IDE driver subsystem.
 Many newer (2008 and later) USB drive enclosures now also support "SAT"
 (SCSI-ATA Command Translation) and therefore may also work with hdparm.
