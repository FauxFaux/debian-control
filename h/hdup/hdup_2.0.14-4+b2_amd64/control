Description: Filesystem duplicator and backup
 hdup is a backup utility with the following characteristics:
 .
 remote backups (move the backup to another machine); encrypted backups;
 no obscure format for the backups; compression (gzip/bzip or none);
 simple to use.
 .
 The source also includes two manpages, one for hdup itself and the other
 for the configuration file. It should be fairly obvious how to use hdup.
