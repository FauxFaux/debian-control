Description: Java library for JVM property-driven configuration
 headius-options provides a simple mechanism for defining JVM
 property-based configuration for an application or library.
 .
 Options are defined via a small DSL-like setup, supporting String,
 Integer, Boolean, and Enum-based configurations. Non-Boolean options
 support a set of supported values, and all options allow specifying a
 default value. In addition, options are created with an Enum-based
 category (provided by the user) and a documentation string, which
 allows grouping properties and printing out a full set of options as a
 valid, modifiable .properties file.
