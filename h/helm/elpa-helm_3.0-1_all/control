Description: Emacs incremental completion and selection narrowing framework
 Helm is incremental completion and selection narrowing framework for
 Emacs. It will help steer you in the right direction when you're
 looking for stuff in Emacs (like buffers, files, etc).
 .
 Helm is a fork of anything.el originally written by Tamas Patrovic and
 can be considered to be its successor. Helm sets out to clean up the
 legacy code in anything.el and provide a cleaner, leaner and more
 modular tool, that's not tied in the trap of backward compatibility.
