Description: Event Record for Monte Carlo Generators
 The HepMC package is an object oriented event record written in C++ for
 High Energy Physics Monte Carlo Generators.
 .
 Many extensions from HEPEVT, the Fortran HEP standard, are supported: the
 number of entries is unlimited, spin density matrices can be stored with
 each vertex, flow patterns (such as color) can be stored and traced,
 integers representing random number generator states can be stored, and an
 arbitrary number of event weights can be included. Particles and vertices
 are kept separate in a graph structure, physically similar to a physics
 event.
 .
 The added information supports the modularisation of event generators.
 Event information is accessed by means of iterators supplied with the
 package.
 .
 This package ships the shared object for HepMC.
