Description: Optional sound files for heroes
 Heroes is similar to the "Tron" and "Nibbles" games of yore, but includes
 many graphical improvements and new game features.  In it, you must maneuver
 a small vehicle around a world and collect powerups while avoiding obstacles,
 your opponents' trails, and even your own trail.
 .
 This package contains optional sound effects for heroes.  Install these if
 you want nifty little noises while playing the game.
