Description: HTML to DocBook XML conversion
 The reuse of HTML content in presentation-neutral form is a frequent problem.
 One possible solution is to convert HTML to DocBook XML, because DocBook is a
 semantic markup language for documentation, which enables its users to create
 document content that captures the logical structure of the content.
 .
 The command line tool herold can be used to convert HTML to DocBook. Because
 HTML elements are often used not as intended, the possibilities for such a
 transformation are somewhat limited. herold is part of the dbdoclet suite of
 tools. For more information visit http://www.dbdoclet.org.
