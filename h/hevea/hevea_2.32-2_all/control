Description: translates from LaTeX to HTML, info, or text
 Its remarkable features are
  - It produces good output. Special symbols (like mathematical symbols) are
    translated into HTML entities which should be rendered by any graphical
    browser. Picture files are only generated on demand, for instance when
    translating graphics.
  - It is highly configurable through (La)TeX macros. Though aimed at
    LaTeX input it understands a fair subset of TeX's macro language.
  - It runs fast.
