Description: hexchat plugin to support Off The Record (OTR)
 A plugin for the IRC client hexchat to support Off The Record (OTR)
 conversations.
 .
 OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM by providing:
  - Encryption
   - No one else can read your instant messages.
  - Authentication
   - You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
  - Deniability
   - The messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures that are
     checkable by a third party.  Anyone can forge messages after a
     conversation to make them look like they came from you.  However,
     _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages
     they see are authentic and unmodified.
  - Perfect forward secrecy
   - If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation
     is compromised.
