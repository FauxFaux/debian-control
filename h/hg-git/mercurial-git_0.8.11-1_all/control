Description: Git plugin for Mercurial
 The Hg-Git plugin for Mercurial adds the ability to push and pull to/from
 a Git server repository. This means you can collaborate on Git based
 projects from Mercurial, or use a Git server as a collaboration point
 for a team with developers using both Git and Mercurial.
 .
 The plugin can convert commits/changesets losslessly from one system to
 another, so you can push via a Mercurial repository and another
 Mercurial client can pull it and their changeset node ids will be
 identical - Mercurial data does not get lost in translation.
