Description: Subversion client as Mercurial extension
 hgsubversion is an extension for Mercurial that
 allows using Mercurial as a Subversion client.
 .
 At this point, hgsubversion is usable by users reasonably
 familiar with Mercurial as a VCS. It's not recommended to
 dive into hgsubversion as an introduction to Mercurial,
 since hgsubversion "bends the rules" a little and violates
 some of the typical assumptions of early Mercurial users.
