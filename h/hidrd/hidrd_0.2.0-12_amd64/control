Description: tools for parsing and generating HID report descriptors
 The hidrd package is a library and collection of tools for parsing
 and generating HID report descriptors. It is an alternative to and in
 some ways an improvement over the official HID Descriptor Tool.
 .
 Native descriptor format is fully supported. An XML format
 is developed and supported for input and output. Specification
 example format is supported for output. Output to C source code with
 specification example format comments is supported. A tool called
 "hidrd-convert" is implemented and could be used to convert
 descriptors between formats.
