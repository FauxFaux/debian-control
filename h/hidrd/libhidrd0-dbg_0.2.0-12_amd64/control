Description: detached debugging symbols for libhidrd0
 This package contains detached debugging symbols for the hidrd USB
 HID interface library.  The hidrd package is a library and collection
 of tools for parsing and generating HID report descriptors. It is an
 alternative to and in some ways an improvement over the official HID
 Descriptor Tool.
 .
 Native descriptor format is fully supported. An XML format
 is developed and supported for input and output. Specification
 example format is supported for output. Output to C source code with
 specification example format comments is supported. A tool called
 "hidrd-convert" is implemented and could be used to convert
 descriptors between formats.
