Description: development files for parsing and generating USB HID reports
 This package contains development libraries and headers for the hidrd
 USB HID interface library.  The hidrd package is a library and
 collection of tools for parsing and generating HID report
 descriptors. It is an alternative to and in some ways an improvement
 over the official HID Descriptor Tool.
 .
 Native descriptor format is fully supported. An XML format
 is developed and supported for input and output. Specification
 example format is supported for output. Output to C source code with
 specification example format comments is supported. A tool called
 "hidrd-convert" is implemented and could be used to convert
 descriptors between formats.
