Description: OpenSSL Encryption backend for Hiera
 A backend for Hiera that provides per-value encryption of sensitive
 data within yaml files to be used by Puppet.
 .
 Only the values are encrypted, allowing files to be swiftly reviewed
 without decryption.
 .
 The value of each key is encrypted individually, which means that
 "git diff" is meaningful.
 .
 Includes a command line tool for encrypting, decrypting, editing and
 rotating keys. This makes it almost as easy as using clear text
 files.
 .
 Basic asymmetric encryption (PKCS#7) is used by default. This does
 not require any native libraries to be compiled, and it allows users
 without the private key to encrypt values that the puppet master can
 decrypt
 .
 hiera-eyaml includes a pluggable encryption framework (e.g. GPG
 encryption (hiera-eyaml-gpg) can be used if you have the need for
 multiple keys and easier key rotation)
