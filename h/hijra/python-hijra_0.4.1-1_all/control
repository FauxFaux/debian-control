Description: Hijri Islamic Calendar converting functions for Python
 Hijri Islamic Calendar converting functions, based on an enhanced algorithm
 designed by Muayyad Saleh Alsadi.
 It can be used to implement applications, gdesklets or karamba ..etc
 .
 This algorithm is based on integer operations which that there is no round
 errors (given accurate coefficients) the accuracy of this algorithm is based
 on 3 constants (p, q and a) where p/q is the full months percentage [ gcd(p,q)
 must be 1 ] currently it is set to 191/360 which mean that there is 191 months
 having 30 days in a span of 360 years, other months are 29 days, and a is just
 a shift.
