Description: library for reading and writing Windows Registry hives
 libhivex is a self-contained library for reading and writing Windows
 Registry "hive" binary files.
 .
 Unlike many other tools in this area, it doesn't use the textual .REG
 format for output, because parsing that is as much trouble as parsing
 the original binary format. Instead it makes the file available
 through a C API, or there is a separate program to export the hive as
 XML.
