Description: diffractometer computation control library - development files
 The hkl library is a framework for diffraction computation and
 diffractometer control, heavily used at the SOLEIL synchrotron. It
 supports various types of diffractometer geometry: Eulerian 4-circle,
 Eulerian 6-circle, kappa 4-circle, kappa 6-circle, and z-axis
 geometry. For each of these it provides several numerically computed
 modes, such as bisector and constant psi.
 .
 This package provides everything needed to link against hkl.
