Description: Insert URLs into html documents
 Hlins is a tool to insert hypertext links into HTML documents,
 using a database with entries of the form "name = url". It is
 designed for inserting URLs of real persons: it knows about
 abbreviations of first and middle names and tolerates dropping
 the second part of a composite last name.
