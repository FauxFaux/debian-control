Description: web application to control an OpenStack cloud - Apache support
 The OpenStack Dashboard is a web application to control an OpenStack
 cloud. It connects to OpenStack services such as Nova, Swift, or Keystone
 using the OpenStack REST API just as you would with the command line
 clients.
 .
 This package includes the configuration files to use within Apache. If you
 wish to configure Apache yourself, use only openstack-dashboard.
