Description: (de)register hotswappable IDE hardware
 Hotswap is a utility to register and deregister hotswappable IDE
 hardware. It is written to be used on Laptops with some sort of
 hardware bay to remove the module from the machine without rebooting
 it. eg. Dell Laptops.
 .
 Note that this utility is not required to insert or remove batteries
 or floppy disk drives; only for IDE devices.
 .
 This is a metapackage that Depends on both the command line tool
 and the graphical front-end to allow seamless upgrades.
