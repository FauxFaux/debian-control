Description: HP Postscript Printer Definition (PPD) files
 Because PostScript is just a page description language,
 there is a need to provide a mechanism for a print spooler to
 customize the PostScript Job to the actual printer device.
 .
 A PPD (PostScript Printer Definitions) specify the device specific
 PostScript commands needed to utilize printer features (such as
 printing quality, paper tray, duplex printing).
 .
 This package contains some PPDs for HP printers that are not in
 package linuxprinting.org-ppds
