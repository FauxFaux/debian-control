Description: Search for a MAC address on HP switches
 This package contains a small utility that can query HP switches for their
 connection table. It then allow you to search for a MAC address and tell you
 where it is physically connected (best match first).
 .
 The functionality is similar to traceroute but on Ethernet level and only
 for HP switches.
