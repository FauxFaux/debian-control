Description: C-like compiler which produces HP48 RPN
 `hp48cc' is a C-like compiler that translates the input code into the
 HP48 RPN language.  The language recognized by the compiler is only a small
 subset of the C language, with some non-standard extensions, but powerful
 enough to write complex programs simply.
