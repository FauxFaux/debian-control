Description: minimalist panel for X
 Hpanel is hacked version of fspanel, a small panel that lists your
 windows and allows you to switch workspaces. It requires a window
 manager that is compliant with the NETWM specification. It works
 nicely with pekwm and aewm++, and handles maximized windows better
 than fspanel.
