Description: HP Linux Printing and Imaging - HPIJS PPD files
 This package contains PPD (printer definition) files for the
 printers supported through the HP Linux Printing and Imaging
 System HPIJS driver.
 .
 These PPDs should work well with the matching versions of HPLIP
 and HPIJS, but may not be the most up-to-date PPDs available for
 a given printer.  See http://www.openprinting.org/ for the latest
 version of the PPDs (which are not guaranteed to work well).
