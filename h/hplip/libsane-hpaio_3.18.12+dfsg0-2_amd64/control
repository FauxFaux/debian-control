Description: HP SANE backend for multi-function peripherals
 The HP Linux Printing and Imaging System provides full support for
 printing on most HP SFP (single function peripheral) inkjets and many
 LaserJets, and for scanning, sending faxes and for photo-card access on
 most HP MFP (multi-function peripheral) printers.
 .
 This package contains the SANE backend libraries for use with HP
 Multi-function peripherals.
 .
 Users of hplip are advised to install the hplip{-gui} packages for
 command line and GUI tools associated with HPLIP.

 This package is useful for a minimal footprint headless scanning solution.
