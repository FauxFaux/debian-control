Description: HP Linux Printing and Imaging - CUPS Raster driver (hpcups)
 This package contains a CUPS-Raster-based printer driver which adds support
 for most inkjet printers and some LaserJet printers manufactured by HP. It
 does not provide PPDs for the fax functionality of HP's multi-function
 devices.
 .
 Users of the CUPS printing system are advised to also install the
 hplip package, and use the hp CUPS backend to send data to the printer.
 HPLIP supports USB, networked and parallel-port devices, and enables
 extended hpcups functionality such as border-less printing.
 Selecting any hpcups ppd in CUPS will use hpcups automatically.
 .
 No physical PPDs are shipped with this driver. PPDs are dynamically
 generated via a CUPS DDK .drv file.
 .
 This package can be installed to provide a minimal headless printer
 solution using CUPS.
