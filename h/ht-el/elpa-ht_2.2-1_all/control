Description: hash table library for Emacs
 The missing hash table library for Emacs. Libraries like `s.el'
 (strings) and `dash.el' (lists) have shown how much nicer Emacs Lisp
 programming can be with good libraries. `ht.el' aims to similarly
 simplify working with hash tables.
 .
 Common operations with hash tables (e.g. enumerate the keys) are too
 difficult in Emacs Lisp.
 .
 `ht.el' offers:
 .
  * a consistent naming scheme;
  * a more natural argument ordering;
  * a more comprehensive range of hash table operations;
  * mutation functions always return nil.
