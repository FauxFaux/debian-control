Description: A tagline/.signature adder for email, news and FidoNet messages
 htag is a tagline (aka .signature for those without a Fidonet background)
 adder but it has now been so over engineered that it will also do
 anything you want it to[0], do lots of stuff I want it to, and do stuff
 it wants to.

 [0] Or at least it will if you write the appropriate plugin.
