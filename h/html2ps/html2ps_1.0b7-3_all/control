Description: HTML to PostScript converter
 This program converts HTML directly to PostScript. The HTML code can be
 retrieved from one or more URLs or local files, specified as parameters
 on the command line. A comprehensive level of HTML is supported,
 including inline images, CSS 1.0, and some features of HTML 4.0.
 .
 This is our justification for the suggests list:
 .
 We suggest ghostscript since it is required in order to output DSC
 compliant PS (--dsc option) and make cross references at links within
 the set of converted documents (--xref option).
 .
 We suggest weblint-perl because it's the default method for checking
 HTML syntax (use the -c option).
 .
 We suggest texlive-base because we need TeX hyphenation pattern in
 order to hyphenate text (use -H option).
 .
 We suggest postscript-viewer because this package generates postscripts
 that can be viewed on a postscript-viewer.
 .
 We suggest xhtml2ps because it's a interesting graphical interface for
 this package.
