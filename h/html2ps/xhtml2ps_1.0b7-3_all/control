Description: HTML to PostScript converter (Tcl/Tk GUI frontend)
 This program converts HTML directly to PostScript. The HTML code can be
 retrieved from one or more URLs or local files, specified as parameters
 on the command line. A comprehensive level of HTML is supported,
 including inline images, CSS 1.0, and some features of HTML 4.0.
 .
 This package provides an (outdated) GUI frontend to the html2ps
 converter.
 .
 This is our justification for the suggests list:
 .
 We suggest weblint-perl because it is the default method for checking
 HTML syntax (see Operations | Preferences).
 .
 We suggest lpr because it is the default printing command (see
 Operations | Preferences).
 .
 We suggest mime-support because see is the default command used to open
 the postscript viewer (see Operations | Preferences).
 .
 We suggest postscript-viewer because this package generates postscripts
 which can be viewed with postscript-viewer (see Operations |
 Preferences).
