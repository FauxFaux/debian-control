Description: fast, standards compliant, C based, HTML 5 parser for python
 A fast implementation of the HTML 5 parsing spec for Python. Parsing is
 done in C using a variant of the gumbo parser. The gumbo parse tree is
 then transformed into an lxml tree, also in C, yielding parse times that
 can be a thirtieth of the html5lib parse times. That is a speedup of 30x.
 This differs, for instance, from the gumbo python bindings, where the
 initial parsing is done in C but the transformation into the final
 tree is done in python.
