Description: simple HTML/CSS1 parser library for C++ (development)
 htmlcxx is a simple non-validating CSS1 and HTML parser for C++. Although
 there are several other html parsers available, htmlcxx has some
 characteristics that make it unique:
 .
  * STL like navigation of DOM tree, using excellent tree.hh library from
    Kasper Peeters
  * It is possible to reproduce exactly, character by character, the original
    document from the parse tree
  * Bundled CSS parser
  * Optional parsing of attributes
  * C++ code that looks like C++ (not so true anymore)
  * Offsets of tags/elements in the original document are stored in the nodes
    of the DOM tree
 .
 The parsing politics of htmlcxx were created trying to mimic Mozilla Firefox
 (http://www.mozilla.org) behavior. So you should expect parse trees similar to
 those create by Firefox. However, differently from Firefox, htmlcxx does not
 insert non-existent stuff in your html. Therefore, serializing the DOM tree
 gives exactly the same bytes contained in the original HTML document.
 .
 This package contains files required for developing software that makes use of
 htmlcxx.
