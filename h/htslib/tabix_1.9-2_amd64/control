Description: generic indexer for TAB-delimited genome position files
 Tabix indexes files where some columns indicate sequence coordinates: name
 (usually a chromosome), start and stop. The input data file must be position
 sorted and compressed by bgzip (provided in this package), which has a gzip
 like interface. After indexing, tabix is able to quickly retrieve data lines by
 chromosomal coordinates. Fast data retrieval also works over network if an URI
 is given as a file name.
 .
 This version of tabix is built from the HTSlib source.
