Description: HTTP logging and information retrieval tool - debug symbols
 httpry is a tool designed for displaying and logging HTTP traffic. It is not
 intended to perform analysis itself, but instead to capture, parse and/or
 log the traffic for later analysis. It can be run in real-time displaying
 the live traffic on the wire, or as a daemon process that logs to an output
 file. It is written to be as lightweight and flexible as possible, so that
 it can be easily adaptable to different applications. It does not display
 the raw HTTP data transferred, but instead focuses on parsing and displaying
 the request/response line along with associated header fields.
 .
 This package contains the debug symbols for httpry. Install this package if
 you need to debug such a program or if you need a useful backtrace of a crash.
