Description: Copy websites to your computer, httrack with a Web interface
 WebHTTrack is an offline browser utility, allowing you to download a World
 Wide website from the Internet to a local directory, building recursively
 all directories, getting html, images, and other files from the server to
 your computer, using a step-by-step web interface.
 .
 WebHTTrack arranges the original site's relative link-structure. Simply
 open a page of the "mirrored" website in your browser, and you can
 browse the site from link to link, as if you were viewing it online.
 HTTrack can also update an existing mirrored site, and resume
 interrupted downloads. WebHTTrack is fully configurable, and has an
 integrated help system.
