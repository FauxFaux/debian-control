Description: Compatibility with Haskell 98
 This package provides compatibility with the modules of Haskell
 98 and the FFI addendum, by means of wrappers around modules from
 the base package (which in many cases have additional features).
 However Prelude, Numeric and Foreign are provided directly by
 the base package.
 .
 This is the version bundled with the interpreter.
