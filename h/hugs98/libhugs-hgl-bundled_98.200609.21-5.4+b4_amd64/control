Description: A simple graphics library based on X11 or Win32
 A simple graphics library, designed to give the programmer access
 to most interesting parts of the Win32 Graphics Device Interface
 and X11 library without exposing the programmer to the pain and
 anguish usually associated with using these interfaces.
 .
 The library also includes a module Graphics.SOE providing the
 interface used in "The Haskell School of Expression", by Paul
 Hudak, cf <http://www.haskell.org/soe/>.
 .
 This is the version bundled with the interpreter.
