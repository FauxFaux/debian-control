Description: French dictionary for hunspell (dependency package)
 This is a dependency package that installs one (and only one) of the four
 available French dictionaries. These dictionaries differ in the way they apply
 the spelling reform of 1990:
 .
  - hunspell-fr-modern: this dictionary is a selection of classic and revised
    spellings. It follows the slow evolution of modern spelling. It contains the
    less controversial spellings introduced by the 1990 reform.
 .
  - hunspell-fr-classical: this dictionary is a superset of the "modern"
    dictionary, to which it adds alternative spellings (some which are still
    widely used, some others which are being phased out).
 .
  - hunspell-fr-revised: this dictionary includes only the new spelling for the
    words that were affected by the 1990 reform.
 .
  - hunspell-fr-comprehensive: this dictionary includes both the old and the new
    spelling for the words that were affected by the 1990 reform.
