Description: Lisp (s-expression) based frontend to Python (metapackage)
 Hy is a wonderful dialect of Lisp that's embedded in Python.
 .
 Since Hy transforms its Lisp code into the Python Abstract Syntax Tree, you
 have the whole beautiful world of Python at your fingertips, in Lisp form!
 .
 This package is here for future installability. This is the stable interface
 to install the `hy' language.
