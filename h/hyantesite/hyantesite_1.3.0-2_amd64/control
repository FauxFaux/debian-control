Description: geomatic tool to compute neighbourhood population potential
 Client to perform actions provided by libhyantes.
 hyantes aims to develop new methods for the cartographic representation of
 human distributions (population density, population increase, etc.) with
 various smoothing functions and opportunities for time-scale animations
 of maps.
 It provides a smoothing method related to multiscalar neighbourhood
 density estimation.
