Description: geomatic library to compute neighbourhood population potential
 hyantes aims to develop new methods for the cartographic representation of
 human distributions (population density, population increase, etc.) with
 various smoothing functions and opportunities for time-scale animations
 of maps.
 It provides a smoothing method related to multiscalar neighbourhood
 density estimation.
