Description: non-euclidean graphical rogue-like game
 HyperRogue is a game in which the player collects treasures and fights
 monsters -- rogue-like but for the fact that it is played on the hyperbolic
 plane and not in euclidean space.
 .
 In HyperRogue, the player can move through different parts of the world, which
 are home to particular creatures and may be subject to own rules of "physics".
 .
 While it can use ASCII characters to display the world the classical rogue
 symbols, the game needs graphics to render the non-euclidean world.
