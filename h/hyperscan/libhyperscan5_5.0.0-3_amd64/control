Description: High-performance regular expression matching library
 Hyperscan is a high-performance multiple regex matching library.
 It follows the regular expression syntax of the commonly-used libpcre library,
 but is a standalone library with its own C API. Hyperscan uses hybrid automata
 techniques to allow simultaneous matching of large numbers (up to tens of
 thousands) of regular expressions and for the matching of regular expressions
 across streams of data. Hyperscan is typically used in a DPI library stack.
 .
 libhyperscan only runs on processors with at least SSSE3 support.
