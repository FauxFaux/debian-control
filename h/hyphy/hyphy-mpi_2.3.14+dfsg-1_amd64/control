Description: Hypothesis testing using Phylogenies (MPI version)
 HyPhy is an open-source software package for the analysis of genetic
 sequences using techniques in phylogenetics, molecular evolution, and
 machine learning. It features a complete graphical user interface (GUI)
 and a rich scripting language for limitless customization of analyses.
 Additionally, HyPhy features support for parallel computing environments
 (via message passing interface) and it can be compiled as a shared
 library and called from other programming environments such as Python or
 R.  Continued development of HyPhy is currently supported in part by an
 NIGMS R01 award 1R01GM093939.
 .
 This package provides an executable using MPI to do multiprocessing.
