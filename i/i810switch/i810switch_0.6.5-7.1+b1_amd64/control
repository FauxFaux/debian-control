Description: Enables/disables video output to CRT/LCD on i810 video hardware
 i810switch enables/disables the output to the CRT display and LCD,
 depending on the i810 graphics controller hardware. Such hardware is found
 on some laptops (eg, Sony Vaios, some Dell models, etc). Chipsets also
 supported include i855, i830, i845.

 This package includes the i810rotate script, which toggles the output
 between three states: LCD only, LCD + CRT, and CRT only.
