Description: infinity note compiler
 Infinity is a platform-independent system for executables and shared
 libraries to export information to software development tools such as
 debuggers.
 .
 In Infinity, executable and shared library files contain *Infinity
 notes* in addition to their regular contents. Each Infinity note
 contains a function encoded in a platform-independent instruction
 set that note-consuming tools can load and execute.
 .
 This package provides I8C, a compiler for creating object files
 containing Infinity notes. This package also provides I8X, an
 execution environment that can be used to create unit tests for
 compiled notes.
