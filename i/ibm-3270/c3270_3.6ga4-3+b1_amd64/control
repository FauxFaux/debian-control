Description: Curses program for telnet sessions to IBM mainframes
 c3270 opens a telnet connection to an IBM mainframe host in an Xterm
 window or Virtual Console.  It can also connect to an IBM AS/400 as
 a 5250 terminal using the AS/400's 3270 emulation.
 .
 c3270 is similar to tn3270(1), and x3270(1) except that it is curses-based,
 not X-based.
 .
 c3270 implements RFCs 2355 (TN3270E), 1576 (TN3270),
 and 1646 (LU name selection), and supports IND$FILE file transfer.
