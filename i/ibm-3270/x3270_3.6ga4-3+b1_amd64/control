Description: X11 program for telnet sessions to IBM mainframes
 x3270 opens a telnet connection to an IBM mainframe host in an X11
 window.  It can also connect to an IBM AS/400 as a 5250 terminal
 using the AS/400's 3270 emulation.  The window created by x3270 can
 use its own font for displaying characters, so it is a fairly
 accurate representation of an IBM 3278 or 3279.
 .
 x3270 is similar to tn3270(1) and c3270(1) except that it is X-based,
 not curses-based.
 .
 x3270 implements RFCs 2355 (TN3270E), 1576 (TN3270),
 and 1646 (LU name selection), and supports IND$FILE file transfer.
 .
 You will need to install x3270's fonts locally, or on your font-server -
 they are required.
