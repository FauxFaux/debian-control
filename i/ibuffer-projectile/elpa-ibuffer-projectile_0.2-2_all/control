Description: group buffers in ibuffer list by Projectile project
 Emacs' ibuffer-mode is a wonderful replacement for the built-in list-buffer
 command, and allows buffers to be grouped programmatically, e.g. by major mode.
 .
 This package lets you group your buffers by their Projectile root directory.
