Description: group ibuffer list by VC project and show VC status
 Emacs' ibuffer-mode is a wonderful replacement for the built-in list-buffer
 command, and allows buffers to be grouped programmatically, e.g. by major mode.
 .
 That's where ibuffer-vc comes in: it lets you:
 .
  * Group your buffers by their parent vc root directory
  * See the VC status of the associated files
  * Sort buffers by their VC status
