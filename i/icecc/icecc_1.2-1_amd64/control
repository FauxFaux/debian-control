Description: distributed compiler (client and server)
 icecc (also known as Icecream) is a distributed compile system. It allows
 parallel compiling by distributing the compile jobs to several nodes of
 a compile network running the icecc daemon. The icecc scheduler routes
 the jobs and provides status and statistics information to the icecc monitor.
 .
 Each compile node can accept one or more compile jobs depending on the number
 of processors and the settings of the daemon. Link jobs and other jobs which
 cannot be distributed are executed locally on the node where the compilation
 is started.
