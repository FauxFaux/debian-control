Description: lightweight stream download utility
 icecream is a non-interactive stream download utility written in Perl.
 It connects to icecast and shoutcast servers or direct stream URLs, and
 redirects all fetched content to stdout and/or to media files on your disk.
 .
 Listen to the stream piping the output to a stdin-capable media player.
 Save the stream to a named file or split it into different tracks.
 It is possible to redirect the stream and save it to disk at the same time.
