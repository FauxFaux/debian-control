Description: transitional package for icewm
 IceWm is a Window Manager for X Window System. It is fast and
 memory-efficient, and it provides different looks and some desktop-like
 functionality.
 .
 This package only exists to maintain compatibility to system setups that
 relied on the former icewm-lite package. It can be safely removed once the
 system dependencies has been adjusted.
