Description: host and network monitoring system - MySQL support
 Icinga 2 is a general-purpose monitoring application to fit the needs of
 any size of network. Icinga 1.x was a Nagios fork; this new generation
 has been rewritten from scratch in C++, with multi-threading and cluster
 support.
 .
 Features:
  * all standard features of Icinga and Nagios;
  * much faster and more scalable than Icinga 1 and Nagios;
  * new, more intuitive, template-based configuration format;
  * monitoring services on ICMP (ping) or TCP ports (HTTP, NNTP, POP3,
    SMTP, etc.) by executing checks (see monitoring-plugins*);
  * any small script following the Nagios plugin API can be used as a
    check plugin;
  * notifications about alerts for any custom script (with examples);
  * native support for Livestatus and Graphite.
 .
 This package provides the IDO module for the MySQL database.
