Description: Software control for ICOM radios with CI-V interface
 This program allows you to control many types of ICOM radio
 (transceivers and receivers) from the serial port on your computer.
 You need a CI-V interface circuit to connect the radio to the computer
 (to convert between RS-232 and TTL), which can be easily found on the web.
