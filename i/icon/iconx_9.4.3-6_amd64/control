Description: Executor for Icon, a high-level programming language
 Ideal for both complex nonnumerical applications and for situations where
 users need quick solutions with a minimum of programming effort, Icon is a
 high-level, general purpose programming language with a syntax similar to
 Pascal and C. Its applications include: rapid prototyping, analyzing
 natural languages, generating computer programs, and artificial
 intelligence. (From the back cover of the book "The Icon Programming
 Language," by Griswold and Griswold.)
 .
 This package contains the Icon executor, iconx, which is needed to execute
 interpreted Icon programs. If you are starting from Icon source code (as
 opposed to precompiled `ucode' files), you will also need the icont
 package, which converts your Icon source into a program that iconx can
 execute.
