Description: Library for Unicode support and internationalization
 ICU is a mature, widely used set of C/C++ and Java libraries for
 Unicode support, software internationalization and globalization
 (i18n/g11n). It grew out of the JDK 1.1 internationalization APIs, which
 the ICU team contributed, and the project continues to be developed
 for the most advanced Unicode/i18n support. ICU is widely portable and
 gives applications the same results on all platforms and between C/C++
 and Java software.
