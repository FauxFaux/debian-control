Description: Fast, high-capacity, identifier database tool
 Actually, the term `identifier' is too limiting--`mkid' stores
 tokens, be they program identifiers of any form, literal numbers, or
 words of human-readable text.  Database queries can be issued from the
 command-line, or from within emacs, serving as an augmented tags
 facility.
