Description: An advanced ident daemon
 ident2 is an advanced, configurable ident daemon. You can set it to lie,
 not lie, or not return any response at all, and it is per-user configurable
 (e.g. if user daniel was IRCing, it'd use ~daniel/.ident for its config, if
 user kim was IRCing, it'd use ~kim/.ident). The admin can specify whether
 users can configure the type of return they want or not.
