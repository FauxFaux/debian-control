Description: Low-level astronomy software for GDL
 The IDL Astronomy Users Library is a central repository for low-level
 astronomy software written in the GNU Data Language (GDL).
 The library is not meant to be an integrated package, but rather is a
 collection of procedures from which users can pick and choose (and possibly
 modify) for their own use. Submitted procedures are given a cursory testing,
 but are basically stored in the library as submitted.
 .
 The library was originally written for the commercial IDL interpreter, but
 large parts are usable with the GDL interpreter as well. Other names for the
 libraries are "astron" and "idlastro".
