Description: change the idle3 timer of recent Western Digital Hard Disk Drives
 Idle3-tools provides a linux/unix utility that can disable, get and
 set the value of the infamous idle3 timer found on recent Western
 Digital Hard Disk Drives.
 .
 It can be used as an alternative to the official wdidle3.exe
 proprietary utility, without the need to reboot in a DOS environment.
 .
 A power off/on cycle of the drive will still be mandatory for new
 settings to be taken into account.
 .
 Modern Western Digital "Green" Drives include the Intellipark feature
 that stops the disk when not in use.
 .
 Unfortunately, the default timer setting is not perfect on linux/unix
 systems, including many NAS, and leads to a dramatic increase of the
 Load Cycle Count value (SMART attribute #193). With the default timer
 setting, the drive will spin down *every eight seconds* if idle and
 this may get the spindle motor to burn out in a few months or so.
 .
 If you have a Western Digital EADS or EARS drive, please check you
 SMART information before it's too late by running the following
 command:
 .
  sudo smartctl -A /dev/sda | grep "^193"
 .
 If the Load cycle count (which is in the last column) exceeds 1000,
 you're probably affected by the idle3 timer problem.
