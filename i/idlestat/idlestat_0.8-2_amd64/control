Description: measure CPU time in idle and operating states
 Idlestat uses kernel FTRACE function to monitor and capture C-state and
 P-state transitions of CPUs over a time interval.  It calculates the total,
 average, min and max times spend in each C-state, P-state for each CPU and in
 each CPU cluster.  It also reports the times specific IRQs caused the CPU
 to exit idle state, per CPU and per-IRQ.
