Description: IDZebra filter grs.marc (ISO2709 MARC reader)
 This package includes the grs.marc and grs.marcxml filters that allows
 IDZebra to read MARC records based on ISO2709.

 IDZebra is a high-performance, general-purpose structured text indexing
 and retrieval engine. It reads structured records in a variety of input
 formats (eg. email, XML, MARC) and allows access to them through exact
 boolean search expressions and relevance-ranked free-text queries.
