Description: IDZebra filter grs.xml (XML filter)
 This package includes the grs.xml filter which uses Expat to
 parse records in XML and turn them into IDZebra's internal grs node.
 DEPRECATED, better use the libidzebra-2.0-mod-dom indexing filter.
 .
 IDZebra is a high-performance, general-purpose structured text indexing
 and retrieval engine. It reads structured records in a variety of input
 formats (eg. email, XML, MARC) and allows access to them through exact
 boolean search expressions and relevance-ranked free-text queries.
