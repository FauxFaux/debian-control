Description: help Internet Explorer behave like a standards-compliant browser
 IE7.js is a JavaScript library to make Microsoft Internet Explorer
 behave like a standards-compliant browser. It fixes many HTML and CSS
 issues and makes transparent PNG work correctly under IE5 and IE6.
 .
 This package is mainly provided for use by existing projects already
 using IE7.js. For other uses, the separately packaged Modernizr (with
 its embedded html5shim/html5shiv) may be a better choice.
