Description: Network scripts for ifupdown
 This package provides a set of network testing scripts to be used together
 with the ifupdown package. These scripts can:
   - check the network cable before an interface is configured.
   - test if an assigned IPv4 or IPv6 address is already in use in the network.
   - test if default network gateways are reachable.
   - setup default static routes for interfaces.
 .
 Additionally network static routes can also be defined globally for the
 system when this is needed (e.g. for 'reject' rules) and will be
 added after network initialisation.
 .
 This package also provides 'network-test', a script to test the network
 configuration status by checking:
   - Status of available interface.
   - Availability of configured gateway routes.
   - If host resolution is working properly (DNS checks).
   - If network connectivity is working, including ICMP and web connections to
     remote web servers.
