Description: FUSE module for iPhone and iPod Touch devices
 iFuse is a FUSE filesystem driver which uses libiphone to connect to iPhone
 and iPod Touch devices without needing to "jailbreak" them. iFuse uses the
 native Apple AFC protocol over a normal USB cable in order to access the
 device's media files.
 .
 Although iFuse is now in a working state it is still under heavy
 development and should be considered experimental.
