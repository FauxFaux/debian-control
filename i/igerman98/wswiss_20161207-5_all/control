Description: Swiss (German) orthography wordlist
 This is a wordlist with the new German orthography (de-CH-1996), which
 is used since 1998-08-01 and which is obligatory as of 2005-08-01.

 It is based on the famous hkgerman dictionary (using the old German
 orthography, which is available as wogerman), with many corrections
 and additions.
 .
 Most notably this variant supports swiss spelling.  This includes some
 Swiss words, as well as ss instead of German sz ligature.
