Description: IIO sensors to D-Bus proxy
 Industrial I/O subsystem is intended to provide support for devices
 that in some sense are analog to digital or digital to analog convertors
 .
 Devices that fall into this category are:
  * ADCs
  * Accelerometers
  * Gyros
  * IMUs
  * Capacitance to Digital Converters (CDCs)
  * Pressure Sensors
  * Color, Light and Proximity Sensors
  * Temperature Sensors
  * Magnetometers
  * DACs
  * DDS (Direct Digital Synthesis)
  * PLLs (Phase Locked Loops)
  * Variable/Programmable Gain Amplifiers (VGA, PGA)
 .
 Many ultrabooks ship with some of these devices. iio-sensor-proxy is
 intended to serve as a proxy, providing access to these devices through
 a D-Bus interface
