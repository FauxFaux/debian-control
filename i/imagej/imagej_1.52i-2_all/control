 32-bit images. It can read many image formats including TIFF, GIF, JPEG,
 BMP, DICOM, FITS and "raw". It supports "stacks", a series of images that
 share a single window.
 .
 It can calculate area and pixel value statistics of user-defined
 selections. It can measure distances and angles. It can create density
 histograms and line profile plots. It supports standard image processing
 functions such as contrast manipulation, sharpening, smoothing, edge
 detection and median filtering.
 .
 Spatial calibration is available to provide real world dimensional
 measurements in units such as millimeters. Density or gray scale
 calibration is also available.
 .
