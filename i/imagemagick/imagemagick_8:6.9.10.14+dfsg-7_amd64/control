Description: image manipulation programs -- binaries
 ImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap images.
 It can read, convert and write images in a variety of formats (over 100)
 including DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PhotoCD, PNG, Postscript,
 SVG, and TIFF. Use ImageMagick to translate, flip, mirror, rotate, scale,
 shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special
 effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and BÃ©zier curves.
 All manipulations can be achieved through shell commands as well as through
 an X11 graphical interface (display).
