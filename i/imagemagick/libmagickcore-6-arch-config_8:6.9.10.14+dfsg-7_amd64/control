Description: low-level image manipulation library - architecture header files
 The MagickCore API is a low-level interface between the C programming language
 and the ImageMagick image processing libraries and is recommended for
 wizard-level programmers only. Unlike the MagickWand C API which uses only a
 few opaque types and accessors, with MagickCore you almost exclusively access
 the structure members directly.
 .
 This package includes the architecture dependent part of the
 headers files used by MagickCore.
 .
 This package is independent of channel depth.
