Description: show the current Emacs buffer's imenu entries in a separate window
 This Emacs minor-mode creates an automatically updated buffer called
 `*Ilist*` that is populated with the current buffer's imenu entries.
 Imenu-list is usually configured so that the imenu tree is displayed
 as an automatically resized vertical window (a sidebar).
 .
 An imenu tree can be used as a table of contents for text and markdown
 documents, or for adding modern IDE features to Emacs--features like an
 overview of function and variable definitions.
