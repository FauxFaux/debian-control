Description: Lossless conversion of raster images to PDF (library)
 This module will take a list of raster images and produce a PDF file with the
 images embedded in it. JPEG and JPEG2000 images will be included without
 recompression. Raster images in other formats will be included with zip/flate
 encoding which usually leads to an increase in the resulting size because
 formats like png compress better than PDF which just zip/flate compresses the
 RGB data. As a result, this module is able to losslessly wrap images into a
 PDF container with a quality to filesize ratio that is typically better (in
 case of JPEG and JPEG2000 images) or equal (in case of other formats) than
 that of existing tools.
 .
 Img2pdf includes its own PDF writer but will use the pdfrw module if
 available instead.
 .
 This package contains the Python library.
