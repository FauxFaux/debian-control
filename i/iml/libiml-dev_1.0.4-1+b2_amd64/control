Description: Integer Matrix Library, development files
 IML is a library for exact, dense linear algebra over the integers.
 IML contains algorithms for nonsingular rational system solving,
 computing the right nullspace of an integer matrix, and certified
 linear system solving.
 .
 In addition, IML provides some low level routines for a variety of
 mod p matrix operations: computing the row-echelon form, determinant,
 rank profile, and inverse of a mod p matrix.  These mod p routines
 are not general purpose; they require that p satisfy some
 preconditions based on the dimension of the input matrix (usually p
 should be prime and should be no more than about 20 bits long).
 .
 This package contains development files for IML.
