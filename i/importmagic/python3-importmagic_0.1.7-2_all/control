Description: automagically add, remove and manage Python 3 imports
 The goal of this package is to be able to automatically manage
 imports in Python. To that end it can:
   * Build an index of all known symbols in all packages.
   * Find unresolved references in source, and resolve them against the
     index, effectively automating imports.
   * Automatically arrange imports according to PEP8.
 .
 This contains the Python 3 version
