Description: program to support non-standard buttons on mice in Linux
 Many mice have side or "thumb" buttons that see limited use in Linux, as well
 as a wheel that is not used by many older applications.
 .
 IMWheel supports these non-standard buttons and/or wheel operations by
 allowing the user to map their input to specific key combinations depending
 on the application in use.
