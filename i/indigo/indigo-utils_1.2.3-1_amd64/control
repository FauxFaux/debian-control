Description: Organic Chemistry Toolkit Utilities
 Indigo is a C++ based organic chemistry and cheminformatics software
 environment.  Features Include:
 .
  * Molecule and reaction rendering including SVG support
  * Automatic layout for SMILES-represented molecules and reactions
  * Canonical (isomeric) SMILES computation
  * Exact matching, substructure matching, SMARTS matching
  * Matching of tautomers and resonance structures
  * Molecule fingerprinting, molecule similarity computation
  * Fast enumeration of SSSR rings, subtrees, and edge sugraphs
  * Molecular weight, molecular formula computation
  * R-Group deconvolution and scaffold detection
  * Computation of the exact maximum common substructure for an
    arbitrary amount of input structures
  * Combinatorial chemistry * Plugin support in the API
 .
 File formats Indigo support include MDL Mol, SDF, RDF, CML, SMILES and
 SMARTS.
 .
 This package contains the following utilities:
 .
  * indigo-depict: Molecule and reaction rendering utility
  * indigo-cano: Canonical SMILES generator
  * indigo-deco: R-Group deconvolution utility
  * chemdiff: Visual comparison of two SDF or SMILES files (needs the JAVA
    libraries)
