Description: Program bugs to compete for food and survival - GUI
 Infon is a game which simulates the live of simple bugs who eat,
 propagate, eat each other and evolve. The players can not control
 the bugs directly but write their “intelligence” in the simple
 script language lua and upload it to the game using a plain telnet
 connection. The code can then be modified even while the game
 is running.
 .
 This package contains the graphical client to view the game
 in progress. To host a game, see the infon-server package.
