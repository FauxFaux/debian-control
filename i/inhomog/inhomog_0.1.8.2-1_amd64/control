Description: kinematical backreaction and average scale factor evolution
 The inhomog library calculates average cosmological expansion.
 This particular package contains an example front end program that uses the
 biscale_partition routines of the inhomog library, illustrating
 effective scale factor evolution in a universe with a T^3 spatial
 section that is divided into two complementary domains. The inhomog
 library provides Raychaudhuri integration of cosmological
 domain-wise average scale factor evolution using an analytical formula for
 kinematical backreaction Q_D evolution. The library routine
 lib/Omega_D_precalc.c is callable by RAMSES using ramses-scalav.
 .
 You may use this front-end program for command-line investigation
 of the role of virialisation as a potential replacement for dark
 energy (see Roukema 2017, arXiv:1706.06179).
