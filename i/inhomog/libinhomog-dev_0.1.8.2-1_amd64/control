Description: static library for kin.backreaction/average scale factor
 The inhomog library calculates average cosmological expansion.
 The library provides Raychaudhuri integration of cosmological
 domain-wise average scale factor evolution using an analytical formula for
 kinematical backreaction Q_D evolution. The inhomog main program illustrates
 biscale examples. The library routine lib/Omega_D_precalc.c is callable by
 RAMSES using ramses-scalav (see Roukema 2018 A&A 610, A51, arXiv:1706.06179).
 .
 This package contains the static libraries and header files that
 you will need if you wish to compile a program that uses inhomog
 as a library.
