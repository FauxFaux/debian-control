Description: NNTP client news injector, from InterNetNews (INN)
 'inews' is the program that newsreaders call when the user wishes to
 post an article; it does a few elementary checks and passes the article
 on to the news server for posting.

 This version is the one from Rich Salz's InterNetNews news transport
 system (which is also available as a Debian package).
