Description: notification-based directory synchronization daemon
 The inosync daemon uses the inotify service available in recent Linux
 kernels to monitor and synchronize changes within directories to
 remote nodes using rsync.
 .
 System administrators have relied on cron+rsync for years to
 constantly synchronize files and directories to remote machines. It
 is not feasible to let authors wait for their content to get
 synchronized every x hours with regard to the enormous pace of
 articles and podcasts nowadays.
