Description: command-line programs providing a simple interface to inotify
 inotify-tools is a set of command-line programs for Linux providing a
 simple interface to inotify. These programs can be used to monitor and
 act upon filesystem events. inotify-tools consists of two utilities:
 .
 inotifywait simply blocks for inotify events, making it appropriate
 for use in shell scripts.
 .
 inotifywatch collects filesystem usage statistics and outputs counts
 of each inotify event.
