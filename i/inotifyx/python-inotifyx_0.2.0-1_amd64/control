Description: simple Python binding to the Linux inotify
 inotifyx is a Python extension providing access to the Linux
 inotify file system event notification API. It is primarily
 written in C but has some Python window dressing
 .
 inotifyx exists as an alternative to the much known pyinotify bindings
 .
 Reasons you might choose inotifyx over pyinotify
  * inotifyx is a C extension and does not use ctypes, making it
    faster and less prone to subtle breakage due to changes in the inotify API
  * inotifyx is a much thinner wrapper around inotify. pyinotify is more
    complicated. It does provide features that inotifyx does not, but many of
    them are not needed by most applications
  * The API provided by pyinotify seems to change in incompatible ways on a
    fairly regular basis and with little justification. inotifyx has a simple
    API that will change rarely, if ever.
