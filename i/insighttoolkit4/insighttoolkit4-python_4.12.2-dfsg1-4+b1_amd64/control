Description: Image processing toolkit for registration and segmentation - Python bindings
 ITK is an open-source software toolkit for performing registration and
 segmentation. Segmentation is the process of identifying and
 classifying data found in a digitally sampled
 representation. Typically the sampled representation is an image
 acquired from such medical instrumentation as CT or MRI
 scanners. Registration is the task of aligning or developing
 correspondences between data. For example, in the medical
 environment, a CT scan may be aligned with a MRI scan in order to
 combine the information contained in both.
 .
 This package contains the Python bindings.
