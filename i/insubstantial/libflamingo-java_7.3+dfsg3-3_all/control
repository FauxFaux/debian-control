Description: Provides a swing ribbon container for Java applications
 The goal of this project is to provide a Swing implementation of the
 ribbon container and related components. The components have
 consistent visuals under the existing core and third-party
 look-and-feels, respect the DPI settings of the user desktop and
 follow the core Swing guidelines in the external APIs and the internal
 implementation details.
