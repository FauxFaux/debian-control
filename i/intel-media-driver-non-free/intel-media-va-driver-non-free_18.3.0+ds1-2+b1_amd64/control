Description: VAAPI driver for the Intel GEN8+ Graphics family
 The VA-API (Video Acceleration API) enables hardware accelerated video
 decode/encode at various entry-points (VLD, IDCT, Motion Compensation
 etc.) for the prevailing coding standards today (MPEG-2, MPEG-4
 ASP/H.263, MPEG-4 AVC/H.264, and VC-1/WMV3). It provides an interface
 to fully expose the video decode capabilities in today's GPUs.
 .
 This package contains the video decode and encode driver backend for the
 Intel HD Graphics of the Intel Core processor family. The supported platforms
 include:
  * Broadwell
  * Skylake
  * Broxton
  * Apollo Lake
  * Kaby Lake
  * Coffee Lake
  * Cannon Lake
  * Ice Lake
