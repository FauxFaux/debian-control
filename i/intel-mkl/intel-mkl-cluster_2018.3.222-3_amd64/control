Description: Intel速 Math Kernel Library (Intel速 MKL) (Cluster)
 Intel速 Math Kernel Library (Intel速 MKL) is a computing math library of highly
 optimized, extensively threaded routines for applications that require
 maximum performance. The library provides Fortran and C programming language
 interfaces. Intel MKL C language interfaces can be called from applications
 written in either C or C++, as well as in any other language that can
 reference a C interface.
 .
 This package pulls the development files and libraries of MKL in the present
 architecture, including Cluster support.
