Description: VAAPI driver for Intel G45 & HD Graphics family
 The VA-API (Video Acceleration API) enables hardware accelerated video
 decode/encode at various entry-points (VLD, IDCT, Motion Compensation
 etc.) for the prevailing coding standards today (MPEG-2, MPEG-4
 ASP/H.263, MPEG-4 AVC/H.264, and VC-1/WMV3). It provides an interface
 to fully expose the video decode capabilities in today's GPUs.
 .
 This package contains the video decode and encode driver backend for the
 Intel G45 chipsets and Intel HD Graphics for the Intel Core processor family.
 The supported platforms include:
  * Cantiga, Intel GMA 4500MHD (GM45)
  * Ironlake, Intel HD Graphics for 2010 Intel Core processor family
  * Sandy Bridge, Intel HD Graphics for 2011 Intel Core processor family
  * Ivy Bridge
  * Haswell
  * Broadwell
  * Skylake
  * Kaby Lake
  * Coffee Lake
  * Cannon Lake
 .
 This package contains also contains the non-free encode shaders for VP8, VP9,
 HEVC and AVC for generation 7.5 hardware or newer.
