Description: INTERCAL de-obfuscator
 This package is an implementation of the language INTERCAL, legendary for
 its perversity and horribleness, designed by Don Woods and James Lyon, who
 have since spent more than twenty years trying to live it down. This
 version adds COME FROM for extra flavor, and supports multithreading. Comes
 with language manual and examples including possibly the entire extant body
 of INTERCAL code.
 .
 This INTERCAL implementation works by compiling INTERCAL to C (thus
 de-obfuscating it), and then uses a C compiler to produce binaries (which
 are themselves possibly easier to read than the original intercal "source"
 code).
