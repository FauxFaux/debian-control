Description: Java DSL for binding method handles
 This Java library hopes to provide a more friendly DSL for binding
 method handles.
 .
 Unlike the normal MethodHandle API, handles are bound forward
 from a source MethodType and eventually adapted to a final target
 MethodHandle.
 .
 Along the way the transformations are pushed onto a
 stack and eventually applied in reverse order, as the standard API
 demands.
