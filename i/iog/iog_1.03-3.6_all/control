Description: network I/O grapher
 IOG is a network traffic grapher designed to record cumulative kB/MB/GB
 statistics per hour/day/month. It is intended to be simple, fast
 (supporting thousands of hosts), and well integrated with MRTG. Data for
 each host is updated hourly and HTML graphs are created. It uses a
 data consolidation algorithm which allows for a small, non-growing
 database file for each host. No external graphing libraries or
 executables are required.
