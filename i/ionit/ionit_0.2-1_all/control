Description: Render configuration files from Jinja templates
 ionit is a simple and small configuration templating tool. It collects a
 context and renders Jinja templates in a given directory. The context can be
 either static JSON or YAML files or dynamic Python files. Python files can also
 define functions passed through to the rendering.
 .
 ionit comes with an early boot one shot service that is executed before the
 networking service which allows one to generate configurations files for the
 networking and other services before they are started. In this regard, ionit
 can act as tiny stepbrother of cloud-init.
