Description: Python bindings for ioprocess
 When performing IO over network storage (specifically NFS) the process might
 get stuck in D state.  To prevent your main process from becoming unkillable
 you might prefer to have a slave process do all the risky IO.  This is what
 ioprocess is for.
 .
 This package provides a python API to ioprocess.
