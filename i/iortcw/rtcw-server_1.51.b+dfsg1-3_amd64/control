Description: standalone server for Return to Castle Wolfenstein
 Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a military- and occult-themed first-person
 shooter game in a Second World War setting, originally released in 2001.
 It is a sequel to Wolfenstein 3D, which is also available for Debian
 (in the wolf4sdl package).
 .
 This package contains the iortcw dedicated server for multiplayer,
 based on ioquake3 and the GPL source releases of RTCW. It also contains
 the init script and systemd unit to start the RTCW server, with support
 for multiple server instances under systemd.
 .
 Return to Castle Wolfenstein requires non-distributable game data files
 from the rtcw-data package, prepared using the game-data-packager tool.
