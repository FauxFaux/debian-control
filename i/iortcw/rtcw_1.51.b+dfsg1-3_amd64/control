Description: game engine for Return to Castle Wolfenstein
 Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a military- and occult-themed first-person
 shooter game in a Second World War setting, originally released in 2001.
 It is a sequel to Wolfenstein 3D, which is also available for Debian
 (in the wolf4sdl package).
 .
 This package contains the iortcw game engines for the single-player campaign
 and multiplayer, based on ioquake3 and the GPL source releases of RTCW.
 .
 For security reasons, this version has been modified to prevent native
 executable code from being unpacked from game packages (PK3 files).
 Some game modifications will not work as a result of this change.
 .
 Return to Castle Wolfenstein requires non-distributable game data files
 in the rtcw-data package, prepared using the game-data-packager tool.
