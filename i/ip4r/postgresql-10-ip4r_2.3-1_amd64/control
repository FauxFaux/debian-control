Description: IPv4 and IPv6 types for PostgreSQL 10
 This PostgreSQL module provides several data types which can contain
 single IPv4 or IPv6 addresses or a range of such addresses.
 .
 ip4r supports these data types:
 .
  ip4:       IPv4 address '#.#.#.#'
  ip4r:      IPv4 range '#.#.#.#-#.#.#.#' or '#.#.#.#/#' or '#.#.#.#'
  ip6:       IPv6 address 'xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx'
  ip6r:      IPv6 range '#-#' or '#/#' or '#'
  ipaddress: IPv4 or IPv6 address
  iprange:   IPv4 or IPv6 range
 .
 While PostgreSQL already has built-in types 'inet' and 'cidr', the
 authors of this module found that they had a number of requirements
 that were not addressed by the built-in types.
