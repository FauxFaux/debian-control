Description: daemon for subnet bandwidth monitoring with reporting via email
 This is a daemon which can monitor as many different subnets (or individual
 hosts, by specifying a "subnet" of /32) as you'd like. The reporting facility
 will only be triggered when a defined bandwidth level had been exceeded for a
 defined time.
 .
 Information reported includes the connections which are taking up the most
 bandwidth (ip address and port pairs). Reporting is done via email.
