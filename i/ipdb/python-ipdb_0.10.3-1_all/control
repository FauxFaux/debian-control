Description: IPython-based pdb replacement
 ipdb is a replacement for pdb Python debugger, adding IPython features (tab
 completion, syntax highlighting, better tracebacks, better introspection) to
 it.
 .
 ipdb contains replacements for all functions from the pdb stdlib module. It
 also contains the ipdb binary which can be used instead of the pdb binary to
 debug standalone scripts.
