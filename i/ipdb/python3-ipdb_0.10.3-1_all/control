Description: IPython-based pdb replacement (Python 3 version)
 ipdb is a replacement for pdb Python debugger, adding IPython features (tab
 completion, syntax highlighting, better tracebacks, better introspection) to
 it.
 .
 ipdb contains replacements for all functions from the pdb stdlib module. It
 also contains the ipdb3 binary which can be used instead of the pdb3 binary to
 debug standalone scripts.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the module.
