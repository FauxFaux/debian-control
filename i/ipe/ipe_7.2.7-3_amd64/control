Description: drawing editor for creating figures in PDF or PS formats
 Ipe supports making small figures for inclusion into LaTeX
 documents as well as making multi-page PDF presentations
 Ipe's main features are:
  * Entry of text as LaTeX source code. This makes it easy to enter
    mathematical expressions, and to reuse the LaTeX-macros of the main
    document.  In the display text is displayed as it will appear in
    the figure.
  * Produces pure Postscript/PDF, including the text. Ipe converts the
    LaTeX-source to PDF or Postscript when the file is saved.
  * It is easy to align objects with respect to each other (for
    instance, to place a point on the intersection of two lines, or to
    draw a circle through three given points) using various snapping
    modes.
  * Users can provide ipelets (Ipe plug-ins) to add functionality to
    Ipe.  This way, Ipe can be extended for each task at hand.
  * The text model is based on Unicode, and has been tested with Korean,
     Chinese, and Japanese.
 .
 Package lua5.3 is recommended if using Ipe with LaTeX.

 Package texlive-latex-recommended enables unicode text entry (for
 accented characters).
