Description: Internet Protocol bandwidth measuring tool (development files)
 Iperf3 is a tool for performing network throughput measurements. It can
 test either TCP or UDP throughput.

 This is a new implementation that shares no code with the original
 iperf from NLANR/DAST and also is not backwards compatible.
 .
 This is the development package which contains headers files and the
 static iperf library.
