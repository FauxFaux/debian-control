Description: IPMI management utilities
 ipmiutil performs a series of common IPMI server management
 functions to allow administrators to perform management functions
 without a learning curve. It can gather FRU inventory data,
 SEL firmware log, sensors, watchdog, power control, health,
 monitoring, and has an SOL console. It can write sensor thresholds,
 FRU asset tags, and supports a full IPMI configuration save/restore.
