Description: IP protocols logger
 writes information about incoming ICMP messages, TCP connections and
 UDP datagrams to syslog.
 .
 It is highly configurable and has a built-in DNS cache.
 .
 Please note that upstream is rather inactive lately (no release since
 2001), and that there are some rather nasty bugs.
 .
 An incomplete list of the bugs includes:
   - random packets don't get logged sometimes
   - stops logging at all after some weeks
   - ipv6 never got implemented
   - documentation is out of sync.
 .
 Trying to fix these bugs is not easy. Please do not expect the Debian
 maintainer to do this, but patches are appreciated.
 .
 Please consider using a fully-grown intrusion detection system (like
 snort) instead of ippl.
