Description: Intranet communication tool for Linux
 iptux is an “IP Messenger” client for Linux.
 .
 It can:
  - auto-detect other clients on the intranet.
  - send message to other clients.
  - send file to other clients.
 .
 It is (supposedly) compatible with 飞鸽传书 (Feige) and 飞秋 (FeiQ)
 from China, and with the original “IP Messenger” clients from Japan
 as listed on http://ipmsg.org/ including g2ipmsg and xipmsg in Debian.
