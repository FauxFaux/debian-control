Description: Interactive widgets - Jupyter notebook extension
 Notebooks come alive when interactive widgets are used. Learning becomes an
 immersive and fun experience. Researchers can easily see how changing inputs
 to a model impact the results.
 .
 This package contains the server-side Jupyter notebook extension that allows a
 Jupyter notebook server to serve and display these widgets. You will also need
 to install kernel-side libraries, for an interactive session to drive and
 animate the widgets that are contained in a notebook. For Python 2 notebooks
 this is python-ipywidgets, and for Python 3 this is python3-ipywidgets.
