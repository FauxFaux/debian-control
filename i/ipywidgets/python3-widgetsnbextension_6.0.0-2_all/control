Description: Interactive widgets - Jupyter notebook extension (Python 3)
 Notebooks come alive when interactive widgets are used. Learning becomes an
 immersive and fun experience. Researchers can easily see how changing inputs
 to a model impact the results.
 .
 This package contains the server-side Jupyter notebook extension as a Python 3
 module that may be installed via the notebook.nbextensions executable module.
 .
 This package should *not be necessary* for Debian software to use; instead you
 should directly use the jupyter-nbextension-jupyter-js-widgets package. It is
 provided only for compatibility with non-Debian software.
