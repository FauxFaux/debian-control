Description: IRAF package to obtain radial velocities from spectra
 This package obtains radial velocities and velocity dispersions using
 cross-correlation methods or emission line fits.  It consists of
 several SPP tasks:
 .
  * XCSAO and PXCSAO: cross-correlate spectra,
  * EMSAO and PEMSAO: find emission lines in spectra,
  * BCVCORR: solar system barycentric velocity correction,
  * SUMSPEC: add and/or modify spectra,
  * LINESPEC: synthetic emission line templates,
  * EQWIDTH: equivalent widths of lines in spectra,
  * WLRANGE: wavelength overlap range for a list of spectra,
  * LISTSPEC: list pixel, wavelength, delta wavelength, and/or pixel value for
    spectrum image,
  * PIX2WL: wavelength at a given pixel in a spectrum,
  * WL2PIX: pixel at a given wavelength in a spectrum,
  * VELSET Artificially change the redshift of (log-wavelength) spectra
