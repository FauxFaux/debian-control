Description: discovering hardware properties for OpenStack Ironic - Daemon
 This is an auxiliary service for discovering hardware properties for a node
 managed by OpenStack Ironic. Hardware introspection or hardware properties
 discovery is a process of getting hardware parameters required for scheduling
 from a bare metal node, given it's power management credentials (e.g. IPMI
 address, user name and password).
 .
 A special discovery ramdisk is required to collect the information on a node.
 The default one can be built using diskimage-builder and
 ironic-inspector-ramdisk element.
 .
 This package contains the daemon.
