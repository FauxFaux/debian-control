Description: bare metal hypervisor API for OpenStack - conductor
 Ironic provision bare metal machines instead of virtual machines. It is a fork
 of the Nova Baremetal driver. It is best thought of as a bare metal hypervisor
 API and a set of plugins which interact with the bare metal hypervisors. By
 default, it will use PXE and IPMI in concert to provision and turn on/off
 machines, but Ironic also supports vendor-specific plugins which may implement
 additional functionality.
 .
 This package provides the Ironic Conductore service. It is used to shield
 database access.
