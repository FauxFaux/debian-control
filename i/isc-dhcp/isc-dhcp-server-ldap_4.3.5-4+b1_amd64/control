Description: DHCP server that uses LDAP as its backend
 This is the server from the Internet Software Consortium's implementation of
 DHCP.
 .
 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol like BOOTP
 (actually dhcpd includes much of the functionality of bootpd). It
 gives client machines "leases" for IP addresses and can
 automatically set their network configuration.
 .
 This is the DHCP server with LDAP patches applied to it.
