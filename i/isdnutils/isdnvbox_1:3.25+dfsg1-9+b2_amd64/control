Description: ISDN utilities - answering machine dependency package
 Let your Debian system be your answering machine! Messages can be accessed
 remotely, automatically emailed, etc.
 .
 This package depends for convenience on both the vbox server (with which
 the messages are recorded) and the client (with which you listen to them).
