Description: ncurses-based interactive line selection tool
 iSelect is an interactive line selection tool, operating via a
 full-screen Curses-based terminal session. It can be used either as
 an user interface frontend controlled by a Bourne-Shell/Perl/Tcl
 backend as its control script or in batch mode as a pipeline filter
 (usually between grep and the final executing command).
 .
 This package also includes screen-ir, a script to interactively
 reattach to one of several screen sessions.
