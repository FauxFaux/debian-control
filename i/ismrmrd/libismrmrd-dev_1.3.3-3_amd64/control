Description: development files for ISMRMRD
 The ISMRMRD format combines a mix of flexible data structures (XML header)
 and fixed structures (equivalent to C-structs) to represent MRI data.
 .
 In addition, the ISMRMRD format also specifies an image header for storing
 reconstructed images and the accompanying C++ library provides a convenient
 way of writing such images into HDF5 files along with generic arrays for
 storing less well defined data structures, e.g. coil sensitivity maps or
 other calibration data.
 .
 This package provides the development files.
