Description: Estonian dictionary for MySpell
 This package provides Estonian wordlists for the MySpell
 spellchecker currently supported by Mozilla and OpenOffice,
 plus an Estonian hyphenation pattern for OpenOffice.
 .
 The wordlists are based on work by the Institute of the Estonian Language
 and subsequently improved by Jaak Pruulmann who also created the affix file.
