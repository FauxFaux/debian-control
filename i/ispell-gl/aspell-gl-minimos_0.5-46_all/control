Description: Aspell dictionary for Galician (minimos)
 This is an aspell dictionary for Galician, using the "minimos"
 standard, as put together by Andre Ventas and Ramon Flores.
 .
 There are at least three orthographic conventions for Galician:
 ILG (official), reintegrationist and minimos. ILG uses orthographic
 conventions more similar to Spanish; reintegrationists are
 weighed towards Portuguese. Minimos tries to reach a middle
 consensus point.
