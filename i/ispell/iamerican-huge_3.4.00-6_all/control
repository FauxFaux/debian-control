Description: American English dictionary for ispell (huge)
 This package provides the american-huge dictionary, based on the americanxlg+
 dictionary supplied with the source for ispell, with additional words added
 from the more comprehensive wamerican-huge word list package.
 .
 This is an even larger dictionary than the one installed by
 iamerican-large. Nothing prevents you installing both (and others) at the
 same time.
 .
 There are also -small, -large, -insane, and standard versions of this
 dictionary, and there are ibritish* packages as well.
 .
 The package also suggests wamerican-huge because ispell's (L)ookup command
 needs a word list.
