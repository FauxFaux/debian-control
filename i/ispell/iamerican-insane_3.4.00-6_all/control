Description: American English dictionary for ispell (insane version)
 This package provides the american-insane dictionary, based on the
 americanxlg+ dictionary supplied with the source for ispell, with additional
 words added from the more comprehensive wamerican-insane word list package.
 .
 This is an even larger dictionary than the one installed by iamerican-huge,
 and possibly contains invalid words (as well as words that are very
 uncommon). Nothing prevents you installing both (and others) at the same time.
 .
 There are also -small, -large, -huge, and standard versions of this
 dictionary, and there are ibritish* packages as well.
 .
 The package also suggests wamerican-huge because ispell's (L)ookup command
 needs a word list.
