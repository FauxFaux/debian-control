Description: British English dictionary for ispell (insane version)
 This package provides the british-insane dictionary, based on the britishxlg+
 dictionary supplied with the source for ispell, with additional words added
 from the more comprehensive wbritish-insane word list package.
 .
 This is an even larger dictionary than the one installed by ibritish-huge,
 and possibly contains invalid words (as well as words that are very
 uncommon). Nothing prevents you installing both (and others) at the same time.
 .
 There are also -small, -large, -huge, and standard versions of this
 dictionary, and there are iamerican* packages as well.
 .
 The package also suggests wbritish-huge because ispell's (L)ookup command
 needs a word list.
