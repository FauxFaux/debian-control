Description: British English dictionary for ispell (small)
 This package provides the british-small dictionary, based on the britishsml+
 dictionary supplied with the source for ispell, with additional words added
 from the more comprehensive wbritish-small word list package.
 .
 This is smaller dictionary than the one installed by ibritish. Nothing
 prevents you installing both (and others) at the same time.
 .
 There are also -large, -huge, -insane, and standard versions of this
 dictionary, and there are iamerican* packages as well.
 .
 The package also suggests wbritish-small because ispell's (L)ookup command
 needs a word list.
