Description: British English dictionary for ispell (standard version)
 This package provides the standard, medium-sized British English dictionary,
 based on the britishmed+ dictionary supplied with the source for ispell, with
 additional words added from the more comprehensive wbritish word list package.
 .
 There are also -small, -large, -huge, and -insane versions of this dictionary,
 and there are iamerican* packages as well.
 .
 The package also suggests wbritish because ispell's (L)ookup command
 needs a word list.
