Description: extract ISRCs from audio CDs and submit them to MusicBrainz
 isrcsubmit is a command line utility to extract International Standard
 Recording Codes (ISRC) from audio CDs. It allows one to submit the extracted
 data to MusicBrainz. ISRCs are used to uniquely identify sound and music video
 recordings.
 .
 isrcsubmit supports multiple backends to extract ISRCs: libdiscid (the default)
 and cdrdao for discs that do not store ISRCs in the subchannel information.
 .
 A valid MusicBrainz account is required to submit ISRCs.
