Description: iterative virus sequence assembler
 IVA is a de novo assembler designed to assemble
 virus genomes that have no repeat sequences,
 using Illumina read pairs sequenced from mixed
 populations at extremely high depth.
 .
 IVA's main algorithm works by iteratively extending
 contigs using aligned read pairs. Its input can be
 just read pairs, or additionally you can provide an
 existing set of contigs to be extended. Alternatively,
 it can take reads together with a reference sequence.
