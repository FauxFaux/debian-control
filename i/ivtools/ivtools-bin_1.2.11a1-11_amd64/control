Description: Drawing Editors evolved from idraw
 InterViews is written in C++ and portable to several different Unix
 platforms.
 Applications written with the InterViews library can be configured to
 provide a special "Look and Feel", such as SGI-Motif and normal Motif.
 This package contains mainly drawing programs written using the
 InterViews library: idraw, a basic vector graphics editor, graphdraw,
 flipbook, a vector graphics animation tool, a vector graphics server,
 and some small sample programs like dclock.
