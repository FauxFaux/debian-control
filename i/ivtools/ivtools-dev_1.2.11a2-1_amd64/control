Description: Development files for the InterViews library
 InterViews is written in C++ and portable to several different Unix
 platforms.
 Applications written with the InterViews library can be configured to
 provide a special "Look and Feel", such as SGI-Motif and normal Motif.
 This package contains the include files needed to develop
 applications with the ivtools library, along with appropriate dynamic
 library links and static libraries.
