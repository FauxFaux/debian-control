Description: Application Frameworks layered on Unidraw
 InterViews is written in C++ and portable to several different Unix
 platforms.
 Applications written with the InterViews library can be configured to
 provide a special "Look and Feel", such as SGI-Motif and normal Motif.
 The package includes the unidraw dynamic library, along with
 extensions for frame and graph editing needed by the ivtools vector
 graphics editors.
