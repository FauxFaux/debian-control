Description: reports cluster security vulnerabilities and fixes - Agent
 Ivulncheck is a security tool to centralize the search of vulnerabilities and
 fixes concerning packages on a cluster. It leverages already existing tools
 and services such as debsecan and the Debian and Ubuntu CVE trackers to create
 a centralized database of known vulnerabilities and updates.
 .
 A tiny Ivulncheck agent shell script must be deployed on each node of the
 cluster to report its existing deployed packages (only Ubuntu and Debian are
 supported). Then, several commands can be executed to search vulnerabilities
 and determine available security updates. Four main sources are used :
 .
  * debsecan for Debian hosts.
  * ubuntu-cve-tracker for Ubuntu hosts.
  * CVE-Search for custom installed application (manually configuration
    needed).
  * madison-lite (to complete missing fixes due to possibly outdated sources,
    missing sources or non referenced vulnerabilities).
 .
 Eventually, you can get information (installed packages, monitored hosts,
 known vulnerabilities an available fixes) directly from the API, or through
 a web interface that provides a graphical rendering of the information.
 .
 This package contains the agent. It is designed to be as much as possible
 dependents less.
