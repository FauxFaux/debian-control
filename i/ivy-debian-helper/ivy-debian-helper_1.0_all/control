Description: Helper tools for building Debian packages with Ivy
 ivy-debian-helper contains helper tools to ease the packaging of Ivy
 based projects in Debian. It consists in:
 .
  * an Ivy plugin resolving the dependencies against the system Maven
    repository (/usr/share/maven-repo). The resolver uses the same Maven
    rule files that maven-debian-helper and maven-repo-helper employ
    (debian/maven.rules, debian/maven.ignoreRules).
  * a debhelper class initializing the plugin and running Ant+Ivy in offline
    mode.
