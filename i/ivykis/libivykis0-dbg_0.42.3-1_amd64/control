 The ivykis library is a thin, portable wrapper around OS-provided
 mechanisms such as epoll(4), kqueue(2) and poll(2). It was mainly
 designed for building high-performance network applications, but can
 be used in any event-driver application that uses pollable file
 descriptors as its event sources.
