Description: Asynchronous I/O readiness notification library
 The ivykis library is a thin, portable wrapper around OS-provided
 mechanisms such as epoll(4), kqueue(2) and poll(2). It was mainly
 designed for building high-performance network applications, but can
 be used in any event-driver application that uses pollable file
 descriptors as its event sources.
 .
 Programs written to the ivykis API are generally single-threaded (or
 use only a small number of threads), and never block on I/O. All
 input and output is done in a nonblocking fashion, with I/O readiness
 notification delivered via callback functions.
