Description: Adds features to ivy for creating projects
 ivyplusplus (ipp) adds a few useful features to ivy, such as creating
 an eclipse project from your deps.  Aside from ivy itself, you get a
 few extra tasks and a command line tool that creates a new project by
 filling out a skeleton build.xml and ivy configuration.
