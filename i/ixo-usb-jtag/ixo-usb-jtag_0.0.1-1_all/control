Description: Altera Bus Blaster emulation using Cypress FX2 chip
 This firmware allows a USB-capable microcontroller to act like an Altera
 USB-Blaster JTAG pod. Which in turn may allow you to use tools you'd normally
 use with the Altera USB-Blaster, including UrJTAG and openocd.
 .
 Supported hardware: The Cypress FX2 EZ-USB family, or an FTDI FT245 in
 combination with a CPLD. Builds are included for the hdmi2usb project's boards
 (Digilet Nexys, Nexys2, Atlys and Numato Opsis).
