Description: Java to Javascript object request broker
 Simple and lightweight Ajax/Web 2.0 framework that allows you to call
 methods in a Java web application from JavaScript code running in a web
 browser as if they were local objects residing directly in the browser.
 .
 Jabsorb handles all the details of marshalling and unmarshalling objects
 back and forth between the client and server so that you can focus on
 writing your application features.
 .
 Jabsorb makes use of the JSON-RPC protocol for it's transport mechanism.
 JSON-RPC is a standard protocol and jabsorb can interoperate with other
 standard JSON-RPC clients and servers that may be written in other
 languages.
 .
 Starting with jabsorb 1.2, additional ORB functionality has been added,
 and it extends the basic JSON-RPC protocol to allow for passing data
 structures that contain Circular References.
