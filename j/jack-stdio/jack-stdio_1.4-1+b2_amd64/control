Description: program to pipe audio-data from and to JACK
 jack-stdout is a small tool that writes JACK audio-sample data to
 buffered standard output. jack-stdin reads raw audio data from
 standard input and writes it to a JACK audio port.
 .
 By default jack-stdout writes 16 bit signed integer raw audio data
 (much like mpg123 -s at JACK's samplerate, but it can output
 signed/unsigned 8/16/24/32 bit integer and 32bit floating-point
 data, both big/little endian.
