Description: routes and manipulates audio from/to multiple sources
 jackEQ is a tool for routing and manipulating audio from/to multiple
 input/output sources. It runs in the JACK Audio Connection Kit, and
 uses LADSPA for its backend DSP work, specifically the DJ EQ swh
 plugin created by Steve Harris, one of jackEQ's main authors.
 .
 jackEQ is intended to provide an accessible method for tweaking the
 treble, mid and bass of any JACK aware applications output. Designed
 specifically for live performance, it is modelled on various DJ mixing
 consoles which the main author has used.
 .
 jackEQ wll allow sound as rich and powerful as Jackie O, as street
 smart as Jackie Brown. jackEQ may be the first female entity in JACKs
 realm. Is jackEQ more than you can handle?
