Description: Documentation for libjackson2-jr-java
 Jackson jr is a compact alternative to the full Jackson Databind component. It
 implements a subset of functionality, for example for cases where size of jar
 or startup time matters. In addition to basic datatypes the package supports
 reading and writing of standard Java Beans (an implementation that mimics the
 standard JDK Bean Introspection).
 .
 This package contains the API documentation of libjackson2-jr-java.
