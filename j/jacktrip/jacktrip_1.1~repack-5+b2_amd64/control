Description: high-quality system for audio network performances
 JackTrip is a Linux and Mac OS X-based system used for multi-machine
 network performance over the Internet. It supports any number of
 channels (as many as the computer/network can handle) of bidirectional,
 high quality, uncompressed audio signal streaming.
 .
 You can use it between any combination of Linux and Mac OS X systems
 (i.e., one end using Linux can connect to the other using Mac OS X).
 .
 It is currently being developed and actively tested at CCRMA by the
 SoundWIRE group.
