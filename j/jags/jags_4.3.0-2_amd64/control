Description: Just Another Gibbs Sampler for Bayesian MCMC - binary
 JAGS is Just Another Gibbs Sampler.  It is a program for analysis of
 Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
 simulation not wholly unlike BUGS.
 .
 JAGS was written with three aims in mind:
  * To have an engine for the BUGS language that runs on Unix
  * To be extensible, allowing users to write their own functions,
    distributions and samplers.
  * To be a plaftorm for experimentation with ideas in Bayesian modelling
 .
 This package contains the 'jags' binary as well as the associated
 shared library modules loaded by the binary.
