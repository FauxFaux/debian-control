Description: Builds and maintains chrooted environments
 Jailer is a simple script to help system administrators
 to create and maintain chrooted (that is, jailed) environments.
 It uses a simple configuration file which can be used to
 describe the location of configuration files, Debian packages
 and files or directories used to build the chroot environment.
