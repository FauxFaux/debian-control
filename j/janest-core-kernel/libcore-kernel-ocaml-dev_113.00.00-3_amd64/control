Description: Jane Street's standard library for OCaml - kernel
 Core is an industrial-strength alternative to the OCaml standard
 library.  It was developed by Jane Street, which is the largest
 industrial user of OCaml.

 Core_kernel is the system-independent part of Core.  It is aimed for
 cases when the full Core is not available, such as in Javascript.
