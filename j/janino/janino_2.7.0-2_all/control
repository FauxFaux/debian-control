Description: runtime compiler for Java expressions - binary
 Janino is a compiler that reads a Java expression, block, class body,
 source file or a set of source files, and generates Java bytecode that is
 loaded and executed directly. Janino is not intended to be a development tool,
 but an embedded compiler for run-time compilation purposes, e.g. expression
 evaluators or embedded code as with JSP.
 .
 This package contains the janinoc tool.
