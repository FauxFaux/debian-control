Description: repackage third-party jars
 Utility that makes it easy to repackage Java libraries and embed them
 into your own distribution. This is useful for two reasons:
 .
  - You can easily ship a single jar file with no external dependencies.
  - You can avoid problems where your library depends on a specific
    version of a library, which may conflict with the dependencies of
    another library.
