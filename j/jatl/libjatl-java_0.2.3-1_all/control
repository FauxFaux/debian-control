Description: JATL - Java Anti-Template Language
 JATL is an extremely lightweight efficient Java library to generate XHTML or
 XML in a micro DSL builder/fluent style.
 .
 JATL is particularly useful for creating complicated XML/HTML snippets
 programmatic-ly in Java to be used as lambdas or helpers in jMustache or
 Handlebars.java. Its also very good at creating extremely large XML
 documents while using very little memory.
