Description: JavaBeans Activation Framework
 The JavaBeans Activation Framework (JAF) is a standard extension to the Java
 platform that lets you take advantage of standard services to: determine the
 type of an arbitrary piece of data; encapsulate access to it; discover the
 operations available on it; and instantiate the appropriate bean to perform
 the operation(s).
