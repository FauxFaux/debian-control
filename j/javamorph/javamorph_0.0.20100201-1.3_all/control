Description: Java morphing film-make program for pixel picture-input
 Give two human-face pictures as inputs into the program. Then mark
 important locations whithin both faces by pairs of corresponding points.
 The program will create a short enumerated picture series in which the left
 face moves (morphs) into the right one. You can then create a MPEG (see
 mencoder) from the picture series. An animated GIF (see GIMP) is also
 possible.
