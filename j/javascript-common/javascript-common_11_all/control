Description: Base support for JavaScript library packages
 Web applications that use JavaScript need to distribute it through HTTP. Using
 a common path for every script avoids the need to enable this path in the HTTP
 server for every package.
 .
 This is a helper package that creates /usr/share/javascript and enables it in
 the Apache and Lighttpd webserver.
