Description: Helper scripts for packaging Java programs
 Javahelper contains several scripts which help in packaging
 Java programs.
 .
 jh_depends searches jars to find which packages they depend on,
 similar to dh_shlibdeps. It will also add depends on jarwrapper
 for packages with executable jars.
 .
 jh_classpath will register the classpath dependencies for each
 jar so that they can be automatically loaded when that jar is
 used by other programs.
 .
 jh_manifest updates the manifest in jar files according to
 a provided spec so that the resultant jar files will work with
 jarwrapper-enabled packages.
 .
 jh_exec looks for symlinks to jars which should be executable
 and makes them executable
 .
 jh_build builds java files to jars for you.
 .
 jh_installlibs installs library jars into the correct locations
 .
 jh_makepkg generates a template for a Debian Java package for you
 .
 jh_installeclipse installs features/plugins built by pde-build.
 .
 jh_setupenvironment prepares an out of source built for eclipse builds.
 .
 jh_generateorbitdir creates and populates an orbit dir for eclipse
 builds.
 .
 jh_compilefeatures compiles eclipse features based on feature ids.
 .
 /usr/share/javahelper/java-vars.mk provides a selection of useful
 variables such as various JVM paths and the JVM name for the architecture
 .
 /usr/share/javahelper/java-arch.sh converts Debian architecture
 names into java names to locate libjvm.so in non-make build systems
 .
 javahelper provides CDBS and dh macros so that it can be used with those
 package build systems.
 .
 Note that some of the eclipse helpers depends on packages not pulled
 by default (like with devscripts). You can find these scripts in
 Suggests.
