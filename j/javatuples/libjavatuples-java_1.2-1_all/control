Description: javatuples
 Java library for tuples in Java.
 javatuples is one of the simplest java libraries ever made. Its aim is
 to provide a set of java classes that allow you to work with tuples.
 .
 A tuple is just a sequence of objects that do not necessarily relate
 to each other in any way. For example: [23, "Saturn",
 java.sql.Connection@li734s] can be considered a tuple of three
 elements (a triplet) containing an Integer, a String, and a JDBC
 Connection object. As simple as that.
