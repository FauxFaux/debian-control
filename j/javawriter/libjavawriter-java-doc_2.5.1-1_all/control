Description: Documentation for JavaWriter
 Source file generation can be useful when doing things such as
 annotation processing or interacting with metadata files (e.g., database
 schemas, protocol formats). By generating code, you eliminate the need
 to write boilerplate while also keeping a single source of truth for the
 metadata.

 This package contains the API documentation of libjavawriter-java.
