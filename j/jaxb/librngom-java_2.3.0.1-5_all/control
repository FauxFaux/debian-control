 RNGOM is an open-source Java library for parsing RELAX NG grammars.
 .
 In particular, RNGOM can:
  * parse the XML syntax
  * parse the compact syntax
  * check all the semantic restrictions as specified in the specification
  * parse RELAX NG into application-defined data structures
  * build a default data structure based around the binarized simple syntax
    or another data structure that preserves more of the parsed information
  * parse foreign elements/attributes in a schema
  * parse comments in a schema
