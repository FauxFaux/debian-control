Description: fast linear algebra library for Java
 jblas is a fast linear algebra library for Java. jblas is essentially
 a light-weight wrapper around BLAS and LAPACK routines, the
 de-facto industry standard for matrix computations. It uses
 state-of-the-art implementations like ATLAS for all its computational
 routines, making it very fast.
 .
 This package contains the binaries and examples.
