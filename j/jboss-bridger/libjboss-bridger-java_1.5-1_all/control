Description: Java Bridge Method Maker
 When compiling a class or interface that extends a parameterized class or
 implements a parameterized interface, the compiler may need to create a
 synthetic method. These are also called bridge methods. JBoss Bridger is a
 bytecode mangler for creating your own synthetic bridge methods, which allows
 more dramatic source code changes while still maintaining binary
 compatibility.
