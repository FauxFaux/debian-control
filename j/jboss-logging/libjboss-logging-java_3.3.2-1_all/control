Description: JBoss Logging Framework
 JBoss Logging provides an easy way to add logging to an application. You add
 code to your application that uses the framework to send log messages in a
 defined format. When the application is deployed to an application server,
 these messages can be captured by the server and displayed and/or written to
 file according to the server's configuration.
