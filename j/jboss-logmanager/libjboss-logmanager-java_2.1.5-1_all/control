Description: implementation of java.util.logging.LogManager
 JBoss LogManager is a replacement for the JDK 1.4 logging system LogManager
 that fixes or works around many serious problems in the default
 implementation. Since many frameworks and libraries (as well as the JDK
 itself) use this logging facility, having robust support for it is an
 essential requirement for many applications.
