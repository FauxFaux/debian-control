Description: Documentation for jboss-xnio
 XNIO is a simplified low-level I/O layer which can be used anywhere you are
 using non-blocking I/O today. It frees you from the hassle of dealing with
 Selectors and the lack of NIO support for multicast sockets and non-socket
 I/O, while still maintaining all the capabilities present in NIO, and it opens
 the door to non-obvious optimizations.

 This package contains the API documentation of libjboss-xnio-java.
