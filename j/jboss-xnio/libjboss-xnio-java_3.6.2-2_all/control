Description: simplified low-level I/O layer for NIO
 XNIO is a simplified low-level I/O layer which can be used anywhere you are
 using non-blocking I/O today. It frees you from the hassle of dealing with
 Selectors and the lack of NIO support for multicast sockets and non-socket
 I/O, while still maintaining all the capabilities present in NIO, and it opens
 the door to non-obvious optimizations.
 .
 XNIO provides a unique API for combining blocking and non-blocking operations,
 even on the same channel, allowing you to take advantage of the simplicity and
 low latency of blocking I/O while still gaining the thread-conservative and
 throughput benefits of non-blocking I/O.
