Description: Documentation for Java Components for Mathematics
 THE "Java Components For Mathematics" project represents an effort to develop a
 framework of configurable mathematical software components written in the Java
 programming language. Our Java components are meant to be used on instructional
 Web pages as interactive illustrations, special-purpose calculators, support
 for exercises, and so forth. The components in Version 1 are mostly useful for
 calculus and pre-calculus and for science courses that use some of the same
 material. They use Java 1.1, and so will not work in some older browsers that
 support only Java 1.0.

 This project was supported by NSF grant number DUE-9950473.
