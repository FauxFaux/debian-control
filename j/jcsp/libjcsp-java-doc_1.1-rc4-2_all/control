Description: Documentation for libjcsp-java
 Documentation for JCSP (Communication Sequential Processes for
 Java) that is a library providing a concurrency model that is a
 combination of ideas from Hoare's CSP and Milner's pi-calculus.
 .
 Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) is a mathematical
 theory for specifying and verifying complex patterns of
 behaviour arising from interactions between concurrent
 objects.
 .
 JSCP provides a base range of CSP primitives plus a rich set of
 extensions. Also included is a package providing CSP process
 wrappers giving a channel interface to all Java AWT widgets
 and graphics operations.  It is extensively (javadoc)umented
 and includes much teaching.
 .
 JCSP is an alternative concurrency model to the threads and
 mechanisms built into Java. It is also compatible with
 it since it is implemented on top of it.
