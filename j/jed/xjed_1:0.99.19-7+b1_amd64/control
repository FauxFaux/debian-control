Description: editor for programmers (x11 version)
 Jed is a small, fast (faster startup than xterm with bash),
 and powerful text editor.
 .
 Completely customizable with prepared emulation modes for Emacs, CUA
 (similar to KDE/Gnome/Openoffice), Borland-IDE, Brief, and EDT. Extensible
 in the S-Lang scripting language (with a syntax resembling C).
 .
 Editing functions: folding support; rectangular cut/paste; regular
 expression search/replace; incremental searches; search/replace across
 multiple files; multiple windows; multiple buffers; ...
 .
 Special modes (syntax highlight, indention, compile, ...) for
 Basic, C, C++, DCL, FORTRAN, IDL, Java, NROFF, Pascal,
 Perl, PHP, PostScript, Python, SH.
 Modes for markup languages include HTML and (La)TeX (with AUC-TeX style
 editing and BibTeX)
 .
 Tools: directory editor (dired); info (browse GNU info files); mail;
 rmail; ispell; shell mode; ...
 .
 The native X11 version provides improved mouse support, key configuration
 and X selection interaction. If no display is available, xjed falls back to
 text mode, thus there is no need to install both jed and xjed packages.
 .
 Additional tools and modes can be found in the jed-extra package.
