Description: count k-mers in DNA sequences (examples for testing)
 JELLYFISH is a tool for fast, memory-efficient counting of k-mers in
 DNA. A k-mer is a substring of length k, and counting the occurrences
 of all such substrings is a central step in many analyses of DNA
 sequence. JELLYFISH can count k-mers using an order of magnitude less
 memory and an order of magnitude faster than other k-mer counting
 packages by using an efficient encoding of a hash table and by
 exploiting the "compare-and-swap" CPU instruction to increase
 parallelism.
 .
 JELLYFISH is a command-line program that reads FASTA and multi-FASTA
 files containing DNA sequences. It outputs its k-mer counts in an
 binary format, which can be translated into a human-readable text
 format using the "jellyfish dump" command.
 .
