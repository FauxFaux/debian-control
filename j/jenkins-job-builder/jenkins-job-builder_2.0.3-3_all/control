Description: Configure Jenkins using YAML files - metapackage
 Jenkins Job Builder takes simple descriptions of Jenkins jobs in YAML format
 and uses them to configure Jenkins. You can keep your job descriptions in
 human readable text format in a version control system to make changes and
 auditing easier. It also has a flexible template system, so creating many
 similarly configured jobs is easy.
 .
 Metapackage to install the Python 2 or 3 version of jenkins-job-builder.
