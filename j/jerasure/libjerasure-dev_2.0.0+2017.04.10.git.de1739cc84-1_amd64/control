Description: forward error correction erasure channel library - development files
 In information theory, an erasure code is a forward error correction (FEC)
 code for the binary erasure channel, which transforms a message of symbols
 into a longer message (code word) with symbols such that the original
 message can be recovered from a subset of the symbols.
 .
 Jerasure is a shared library that been designed to be modular, fast and
 flexible. It is used in storage systems such as Swift and Ceph to add fault
 tolerance.
 .
 This package contains the development files needed to build against the shared
 library.
