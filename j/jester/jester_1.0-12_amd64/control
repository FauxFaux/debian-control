Description: board game similar to Othello
 Simple two-player turn-based strategy game played on an 8x8 grid.
 Convert the opponent's pieces to your color by bracketing them between
 your pieces.  The game can be played head-to-head on a single screen or
 by a single player against the computer. Jester allows you to waste
 valuable time that could otherwise be spent playing Solitaire.
