Description: gpg keyring maintenance using changesets
 jetring is a collection of tools that allow for gpg keyrings to be maintained
 using changesets. It was developed with the Debian keyring in mind, and aims
 to solve the problem that a gpg keyring is a binary blob that's hard for
 multiple people to collaboratively edit.
 .
 With jetring, changesets can be submitted, reviewed to see exactly what they
 will do, applied, and used to build a keyring. The origin of every change
 made to the keyring is available for auditing, and gpg signatures can be used
 to further secure things.
