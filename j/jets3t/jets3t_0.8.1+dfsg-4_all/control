Description: graphical and command-line tools for Amazon S3 and CloudFront
 The JetS3t toolkit provides several applications for interacting and managing
 data stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service and Amazon CloudFront content
 delivery network. Features:
  - jets3t-cockpitlite: A graphical application that Service Providers with S3
    accounts may provide to clients or customers without S3 accounts.
    jets3t-cockpitlite allows users to manage the content of an S3 account to
    upload files, download files, delete S3 objects and make objects publicly
    accessible. All these operations are mediated by a Gatekeeper service.
  - jets3t-cockpit: graphical application for transferring files, viewing and
    managing the contents of an Amazon S3 account.
  - jets3t-synchronize: A command-line application for synchronizing
    directories on your computer with an Amazon S3 account. Ideal for
    performing back-ups or synchronizing files between different computers.
  - jets3t-uploader: A graphical application that Service Providers with S3
    accounts may provide to clients or customers without S3 accounts.
    jets3t-uploader allows users to upload files to S3 using a simple
    wizard-based workflow, but all uploads must first be authorized by a
    Gatekeeper service
  - gatekeeper: A servlet that acts as an authorization service running on a
    Service Provider's server to mediate access to S3 accounts.
    It processes requests from client applications such as JetS3t Uploader &
    CockpitLite, and authorizes the client application to perform operations
    such as uploads, downloads and deletes.
