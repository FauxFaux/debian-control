Description: Java GUI client for FTP, SMB, SFTP and NFS
 JFtp is a graphical Java network and file transfer client. It
 supports FTP using its own FTP API and various other protocols like
 SMB, SFTP, NFS, HTTP, and file I/O using third party APIs. It
 includes many advanced features such as recursive directory
 up/download, browsing FTP servers while transferring files, FTP
 resuming and queueing, browsing the LAN for Windows shares, and
 more. Multiple connections can open at a time in a Mozilla-style
 tabbed browsing environment.
