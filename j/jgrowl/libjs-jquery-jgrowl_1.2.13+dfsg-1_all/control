Description: notification system for jquery
 jGrowl is a jQuery plugin that raises unobtrusive messages within the browser,
 similar to the way that OS X's Growl Framework works. The idea is simple,
 deliver notifications to the end user in a noticeable way that doesn't obstruct
 the work flow and yet keeps the user informed.
