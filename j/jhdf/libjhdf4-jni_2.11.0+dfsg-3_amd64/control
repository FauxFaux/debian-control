 HDF is a versatile data model that can represent very complex data objects
 and a wide variety of metadata. It is a completely portable file format
 with no limit on the number or size of data objects in the collection.
 .
 This Java package implements HDF4 data objects in an
 object-oriented form. It provides a common Java API for accessing HDF4 files.
 .
 This package includes the architecture specific Java Native Interface part
 for the Java bindings for HDF4.
