Description: Generate jigsaw and card sort activities for classroom use
 This software is designed to create Tarsia Formulator type
 mathematical jigsaws using LaTeX.  The puzzle data is stored in a YAML
 file, and the software turns it into a printable jigsaw.  This
 software makes it reasonably straightforward to create multiple
 jigsaw-style puzzles.
