Description: Documentation for libjimfs-java
 Jimfs is an in-memory file system for Java 7 and above, implementing
 the java.nio.file abstract file system APIs. Jimfs supports almost
 all the APIs under java.nio.file. It supports:
 .
  * Creating, deleting, moving and copying files and directories.
  * Reading and writing files with FileChannel or SeekableByteChannel,
    InputStream, OutputStream, etc.  Symbolic links.
  * Hard links to regular files.
  * SecureDirectoryStream, for operations relative to an open directory.
  * Glob and regex path filtering with PathMatcher.
  * Watching for changes to a directory with a WatchService.
  * File attributes. Built-in attribute views that can be supported
    include "basic", "owner", "posix", "unix", "dos", "acl" and "user".
    Do note, however, that not all attribute views provide useful
     attributes.
 .
 For example, while setting and reading POSIX file permissions is
 possible with the "posix" view, those permissions will not actually
 affect the behavior of the file system.
 .
 Jimfs also supports creating file systems that, for example, use
 Windows-style paths and (to an extent) behavior. In general, however,
 file system behavior is modeled after UNIX and may not exactly match
 any particular real file system or platform.
 .
 This package contains the generated API documentation.
