Description: Java Game Controller API (jni)
 jinput is an implementation of an API for game controller discovery and
 polled input. It is part of a suite of open-source technologies initiated by
 the Game Technology Group at Sun Microsystems with intention of making the
 development of high performance games in Java a reality.
 The API itself is pure Java and presents a platform-neutral completely
 portable model of controller discovery and polling. It can handle arbitrary
 controllers and returns both human and machine understandable descriptions
 of the inputs available.
 .
 This package contains the java jni library.
