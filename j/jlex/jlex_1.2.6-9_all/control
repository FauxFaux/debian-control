Description: Lex-style lexical analyser generator for Java
 The JLex utility is a lexical analyser generator, modelled after the
 popular UNIX "lex" utility.
 .
 JLex takes a specification file similar to that accepted by Lex,
 then creates a Java source file for the corresponding lexical analyzer.
