Description: Java library for handling console input
 JLine is a 100% pure Java library for reading and editing console input.
 It is similar in functionality to BSD editline and GNU readline.  People
 familiar with the readline/editline capabilities for modern shells will
 find most of the command editing features of JLine to be familiar.
