Description: View hosts/ports taking up the most network traffic
 jNettop captures traffic coming across the host it is running on and displays
 streams sorted by bandwidth they use. Result is a nice listing of
 communication on network by host and port, how many bytes went
 through this transport and the bandwidth it is consuming.
