Description: Java extended native cross-platform I/O library (documentation)
 Java Native Runtime (JNR) is a collection of Java libraries to make
 interfacing with OS-level features easier. JNR uses an alternate
 method to JNI or JNA to achieve programming simplicity while still
 retaining performance.
 .
 The jnr-enxio package mimics the standard Java non-blocking I/O (NIO)
 library by implementing an I/O backend based on calls to the underlying
 native OS-level functions. This is implementing using the jnr-ffi
 foreign function interface.
 .
 This package contains the API documentation of libjnr-enxio.
