Description: Java access to native libraries for unix sockets (documentation)
 Java Native Runtime (JNR) is a collection of Java libraries to make
 interfacing with OS-level features easier.  JNR uses an alternate
 method to JNI or JNA to achieve programming simplicity while still
 retaining performance.
 .
 The jnr-unixsocket package provides access in Java to the unix domain
 socket versions of socket(), listen(), bind(), accept(), connect() and
 others via the native OS libraries.
 .
 This package contains the API documentation of jnr-unixsocket.
