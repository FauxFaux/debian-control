Description: Documentation for Joda Convert
 Joda-Convert provides a small set of classes to aid conversion between Objects
 and Strings. It is not intended to tackle the wider problem of Object to
 Object transformation. Joda-Convert supports two mechanisms of extending the
 list of supported conversions. The first is to write your own converter
 implementing an interface. The second is to use annotations.

 This package contains the API documentation of libjoda-convert-java.
