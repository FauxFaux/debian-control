Description: Joda Convert - Java API to convert Objects to and from Strings
 Joda-Convert provides a small set of classes to aid conversion between Objects
 and Strings. It is not intended to tackle the wider problem of Object to
 Object transformation. Joda-Convert supports two mechanisms of extending the
 list of supported conversions. The first is to write your own converter
 implementing an interface. The second is to use annotations.
