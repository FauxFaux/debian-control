Description: Command line parsing java library - Documentation
 JOpt Simple is a Java library for parsing command line options, such as
 those you might pass to an invocation of javac.
 .
 In the interest of striving for simplicity, as closely as possible JOpt
 Simple attempts to honor the command line option syntaxes of POSIX
 getopt() and GNU getopt_long() . It also aims to make option parser
 configuration and retrieval of options and their arguments simple and
 expressive, without being overly clever.
 .
 This package contains the javadoc documentation.
