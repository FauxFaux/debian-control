Description: Jonathan's Own Version of Emacs - a compact, powerful editor
 Jove is a compact, powerful Emacs-style text-editor. It provides the common
 emacs keyboard bindings, together with a reasonable assortment of the most
 popular advanced features (e.g. interactive shell windows, compile-it,
 language specific modes) while weighing in with CPU, memory, and disk
 requirements comparable to vi(1).
