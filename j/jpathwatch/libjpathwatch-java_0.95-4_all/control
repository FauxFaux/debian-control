Description: Java library that monitors directories for changes
 jpatchwatch is a Java library for monitoring directories for changes. It uses
 the native OS functions to achieve this, avoiding polling.
 .
 The following events on a directory can be monitored:
 .
  * file creation and deletion
  * file modification
  * file renaming
  * changes in subdirectories (recursive monitoring)
  * invalidation (a watched directory becomes unavailable)
