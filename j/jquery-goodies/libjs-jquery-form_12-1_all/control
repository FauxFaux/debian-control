Description: jQuery Form Plugin
 The jQuery Form Plugin allows you to easily and unobtrusively upgrade HTML
 forms to use AJAX. The main methods, ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit, gather
 information from the form element to determine how to manage the submit
 process. Both of these methods support numerous options which allows you to
 have full control over how the data is submitted.
