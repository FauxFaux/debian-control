Description: jQuery treeTable Plugin
 The treeTable plugin allows you to display a tree in a table, i.e. a
 directory structure or a nested list. Each branch in this tree can be
 collapsed and expanded, just like in a file explorer in most modern
 operating systems.
 .
 Features
 .
   * Display a data tree in a table column.
   * As unobtrusively as possible.
   * Optional collapse/expand behavior on branches (think of
     how a directory structure works in most file explorers).
   * Prepared for drag & drop of branches/nodes.
   * Unlimited tree depth.
