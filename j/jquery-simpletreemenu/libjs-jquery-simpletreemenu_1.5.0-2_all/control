Description: visually-simple menu inspired by the Mac OS X Finder tree
 Simple Tree Menu creates a visually-simple menu inspired by the Mac OS X
 Finder tree.
 .
 It uses a straightforward HTML structure based on <ul> that is the same as
 the Son of Suckerfish drop-down menus, so it's easy to learn, and it degrades
 gracefully.
 .
 There's no complex options to pass in and your preferred style can be created
 in CSS. The source-code download includes CSS and PNG icons to create that
 that Apple Finder look, or you can nest other HTML content to create something
 like Google's calendar navigation.
