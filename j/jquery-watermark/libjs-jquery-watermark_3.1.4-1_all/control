Description: watermark plugin for jQuery
 This jQuery plugin adds watermark capability to HTML input and textarea
 elements.
 .
 A watermark typically appears as light gray text within an input or textarea
 element whenever the element is empty and does not have focus. This provides
 a hint to the user as to what the input or textarea element is used for, or
 the type of input that is required.
