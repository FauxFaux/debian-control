Description: Java Simple Application Messaging Protocol tool for VO
 Command-line tool for the Simple Application Messaging Protocol (SAMP) for
 the Virtual Observatory (VO).  This allows direct access to low-level
 operations such as starting a local SAMP communications hub for other
 applications such as Aladin, Topcat and Splat-VO to communication with
 each other.
 .
 In addition to starting a SAMP Hub, the 'jsamp' tool allows for
 monitoring, snooping, testing, and stress running hub instances, or
 setting up a bridge proxy between two or SAMP hub instances.
