Description: Java Simple Application Messaging Protocol library docs
 The Simple Application Messaging Protocol (SAMP) is a messaging
 protocol that enables astronomy software to interoperate and
 communicate as part of the Virtual Observatory (VO).  JSAMP provides
 a hub implementation for SAMP, suitable for standalone or embedded
 use.
 .
 JSAMP also offers a set of classes which can be used to implement SAMP
 capabilities in client applications. JSAMP provides a hub test and a
 benchmarking suite to examine the correctness and performance of
 third-party hub implementations. The software includes hub and client
 implementations of the standard and web profiles and a bridge
 component, which allows clients on different hubs to talk to each
 other.
 .
 This package contains the JavaDoc documentation of the package.
