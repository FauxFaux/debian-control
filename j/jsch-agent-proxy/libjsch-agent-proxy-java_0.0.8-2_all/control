Description: Proxy to ssh-agent and Pageant in Java
 jsch-agent-proxy is a proxy program to OpenSSH's ssh-agent and Pageant included
 in Putty. It can be easily integrated into JSch, and users can  use those
 programs in authentications. This software has been developed for JSch, but it
 is easily applicable to other ssh2 implementations in Java.
