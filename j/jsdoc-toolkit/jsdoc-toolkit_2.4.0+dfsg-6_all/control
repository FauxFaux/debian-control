Description: automatic generator for HTML documentation of Javascript sources
 JsDoc Toolkit is an application, written in JavaScript, for
 automatically generating template-formatted, multi-page HTML (or XML,
 JSON, or any other text-based) documentation from commented
 JavaScript source code.
 .
 Based on the JSDoc.pm project, this was renamed "Jsdoc Toolkit"
 during development as it grew into more than a simple version
 upgrade.
