Description: validating parser of JSON data structures
 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange
 format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for
 machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the
 JavaScript Programming Language. JSON is a text format that is
 completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar
 to programmers of the C-family of languages. These properties make JSON
 an ideal data-interchange language.
 .
 This package provides jsonlint-php, a validating parser of JSON files.
 Another more complete JSON syntax validator and formatter tool is
 provided by the python-demjson package.
