Description: Convert JSON to a UNIX-friendly line-based format
 jsonpipe traverses a JSON object and produces a simple, line-based textual
 format which can be processed by all your UNIX favourites like grep, sed,
 awk, cut and diff. It may also be valuable within
 programming languages---in fact, it was originally conceived as a way of
 writing simple test assertions against JSON output without coupling the tests
 too closely to the specific structure used.
