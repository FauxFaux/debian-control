Description: Implementation of the JSON-RPC v2.0 specification (Python 3)
 This library is an implementation of the JSON-RPC specification.
 It supports both the original 1.0 specification, as well as the
 new (proposed) 2.0 specification, which includes batch submission, keyword
 arguments, etc.
 .
 This is a patched version of the original ``jsonrpclib`` project.
 .
 The suffix *-pelix* only indicates that this version works with Pelix Remote
 Services, but it is **not** a Pelix specific implementation.
