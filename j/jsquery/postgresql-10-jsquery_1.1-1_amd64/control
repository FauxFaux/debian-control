Description: PostgreSQL JSON query language with GIN indexing support
 JsQuery provides additional functionality for the PostgreSQL jsonb datatype,
 such as a simple and effective way to search in nested objects and arrays, and
 more comparison operators with index support. It does this by implementing a
 specialized search syntax, the @@ operator, and the jsquery type for search
 strings.
