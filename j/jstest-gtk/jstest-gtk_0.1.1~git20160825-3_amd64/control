Description: joystick testing and configuration tool
 jstest-gtk is a simple graphical joystick tester. It provides a list
 of attached joysticks, and for each one can display which buttons and
 axes are pressed, remap axes and buttons, and calibrate the device.
 .
 Even when your joystick is working mostly fine, you might want to
 give it a try, as the calibration lets you get rid of overlarge
 default deadzones that many joysticks use and which are a noticeable
 problem in some games.
 .
 Installing the joystick package in addition to this one will allow
 you to store your calibration settings and mappings and have the
 automatically restored.
