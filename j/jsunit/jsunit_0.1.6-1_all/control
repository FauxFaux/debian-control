Description: JavaScript unit test framework for Thunderbird and Firefox
 JSUnit is a Mozilla addon targeted for addon authors to allow for unit
 testing of JavaScript components.  It provides a command line
 interface to run unit tests in installed applications like Firefox and
 Thunderbird.
 .
 Please note: JSUnit is a test tool; it is not recommended for
 production environments, as it modifies various configuration settings
 that slow down your application for daily use!
