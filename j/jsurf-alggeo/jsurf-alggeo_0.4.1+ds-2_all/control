Description: Java based visualization library for real algebraic geometry
 jsurf is a Java library to visualize some real algebraic geometry.
 It is and can be used as the visualization component in Java programs.
 .
 Beside the library, this package also provides a simple script driven
 tool for drawing real algebraic geometric surfaces, as well as some
 script samples. (This simple tool is similar to, but not compatible with,
 the tool surf-alggeo distributed within the package surf-alggeo.)
