Description: Interactive Geometry with JavaScript
 JSXGraph is a cross-browser library to display interactive geometry in a
 web browser. It is implemented in JavaScript and uses SVG and VML.
 At the moment the following browsers are supported: Mozilla Firefox,
 Opera, Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Internet Explorer.

 There are still some issues with JSXGraph in the Internet Explorer, so
 using Firefox, Opera, Safari or Chrome is recommended.

 JSXGraph is easy to embed and has a small footprint: only 50 kB if
 embedded in a web page. No plugins are required!
