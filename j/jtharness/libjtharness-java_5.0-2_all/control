Description: General purpose test harness for Java
 The JT harness is a general purpose, fully-featured, flexible, and configurable
 test harness very well suited for most types of unit testing. Originally
 developed as a test harness to run TCK test suites, it has since evolved into a
 general purpose test platform.
