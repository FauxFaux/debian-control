Description: JTidy HTML syntax checker and pretty printer
 JTidy is a Java port of HTML Tidy, a HTML syntax checker and pretty printer.
 Like its non-Java cousin, JTidy can be used as a tool for cleaning up malformed
 and faulty HTML. In addition, JTidy provides a DOM interface to the document
 that is being processed, which effectively makes you able to use JTidy
 as a DOM parser for real-world HTML.
