Description: Regression Test Harness for the OpenJDK platform
 jtreg is the test harness used by the OpenJDK test framework.
 This framework is intended primarily for regression tests.
 It can also be used for unit tests, functional tests, and even simple product
 tests -- in other words, just about any type of test except a conformance test,
 which belong in a TCK.
