Description: Jules' Utility Class Extensions (module sources)
 JUCE (Jules' Utility Class Extensions) is an all-encompassing C++ framework for
 developing cross-platform software.
 .
 It contains pretty much everything you're likely to need to create most
 applications, and is particularly well-suited for building highly-customised
 GUIs, and for handling graphics and sound.
 .
 This package provides the sources for the JUCE modules, as used by 'jucer'
 projects. (Projucer is provided in the 'juce-tools' package).
