Description: jugglemaster deluxe using wxWidgets
 JuggleMaster is a siteswap animator. A siteswap is a textual representation
 for patterns one can juggle (using balls, clubs, etc.). JuggleMaster is mainly
 useful for understanding specific siteswaps by animating them (including
 multiplexing). Other uses may include watching patterns without understanding
 the notation behind them.
 .
 This package contains the wxWidgets interface and features a lot of builtin
 patterns available via a menu.
