Description: high-performance programming language for technical computing (development)
 Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
 technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical
 computing environments. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed
 parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function
 library. The library, mostly written in Julia itself, also integrates mature,
 best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number
 generation, FFTs, and string processing. Julia programs are organized around
 defining functions, and overloading them for different combinations of
 argument types (which can also be user-defined).
 .
 This package provides the Julia runtime headers.
