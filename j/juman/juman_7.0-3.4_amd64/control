Description: Japanese morphological analysis system
 Juman is a morphological analysis system.  It reads Japanese
 sentences from the standard input, segments them into morpheme
 sequences, and outputs them to the standard output with many
 additional pieces of information (pronunciation, semantic
 information, etc).
