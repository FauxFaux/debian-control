Description: Debian Jr. Documentation
 Includes, for the moment, just the "Quick Guide" which helps a new user
 of Debian Jr. get started.  The intention of the Debian Jr. working
 group is to provide a variety of additional documents to help children
 and sys admins alike with the installation, configuration, and use of a
 Debian Jr. system.
