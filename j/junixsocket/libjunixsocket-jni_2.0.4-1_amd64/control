Description: Unix Domain Sockets in Java (JNI library)
 junixsocket is a Java/JNI library that allows the use of Unix Domain Sockets
 (AF_UNIX sockets) from Java. In contrast to other implementations, junixsocket
 extends the Java Sockets API (java.net.Socket, java.net.SocketAddress etc.)
 and even supports RMI over AF_UNIX. It is also possible to use it in
 conjunction with Connector/J to connect to a local MySQL server via Unix domain
 sockets.
 .
 This package contains the architecture specific Java native interface part.
