Description: reimplement the joe Debian package using jupp
 This package contains symbolic links to replace the Debian joe package
 using the jupp package and implementation (both binaries and manpages).
 It also contains the appropriate conffiles and, in contrast to Debian's
 joe flavour, supports SELinux context copying (on Debian systems with
 the Linux kernel), and has many bugs fixed and makes some of jupps new
 features available to the joe, jstar, jmacs, jpico and rjoe flavours.
