Description: user friendly full screen text editor
 Joe, the Joe's Own Editor, has the feel of most PC text editors: the key
 sequences are reminiscent of WordStar and Turbo C editors, but the feature
 set is much larger than of those.  Joe has all of the features a Unix
 user should expect: full use of termcap/terminfo, complete VI-style Unix
 integration, a powerful configuration file, and regular expression search
 system.  It also has eight help reference cards which are always available,
 and an intuitive, simple, and well thought-out user interface.
 .
 Joe has a great screen update optimisation algorithm, multiple windows
 (through/between which you can scroll) and lacks the confusing notion of
 named buffers.  It has command history, TAB expansion in file selection
 menus, undo and redo functions, (un)indenting and paragraph formatting,
 filtering highlighted blocks through any external Unix command, editing
 a pipe into or out of a command, block move, copy, delete or filter, a
 bracketed paste mode automatically enabled on xterm-xfree86 and decimal
 and hexadecimal gotos for lines, columns, and file offsets.
 .
 Through simple QEdit-style configuration files, Joe can be set up to
 emulate editors such as Pico and Emacs, along with a complete imitation
 of WordStar in non-document mode, and a restricted mode version (lets you
 edit only the files specified on the command line). Joe also has a deferred
 screen update to handle typeahead, and it ensures that deferral is not
 bypassed by tty buffering. It's usable even at 2400 baud, and it will work
 on any kind of sane terminal. Furthermore, it supports SELinux context
 copying on Debian systems with the Linux kernel.
 .
 This version of JOE only comes with the Jupp flavour, to not conflict
 with the Debian joe package, activated. The resource files and executable
 links and menu entries for the other flavours are still available, though,
 in the joe-jupp package.
