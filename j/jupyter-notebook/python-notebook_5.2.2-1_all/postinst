# postinst script for python-notebook
#
# TODO:
# Eventually this script could also contain a "trigger" mechanism that scans
# /usr/share/jupyter/nbextensions and populates the nbconfig/*.json files
# automatically. Once we do that, ipywidgets (and other notebook extension
# packages) could get rid of *its* postinst/prerm scripts and ugly Depends:
#
# See https://lists.debian.org/debian-python/2016/12/threads.html#00006 for more
# details and a concrete proposal on moving forward.

# summary of how this script can be called:

#        * <conflictor's-postinst> `abort-remove' `in-favour' <package>
#          <new-version>
#        * <postinst> `abort-remove'
#        * <deconfigured's-postinst> `abort-deconfigure' `in-favour'
