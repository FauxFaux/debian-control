Description: Text mode interpreter for Z-Code adventures
 This package provides the jzip Z-Code interpreter required to run
 Infocom or Inform-generated text adventures, although the format can
 be used for more than games. It is based on the zip interpreter sources
 and adapted by John D. Holder <jholder@frii.com>.
 .
 The ckifzs program, for checking the basic structure of save files
 against the QUETZAL standard, is also included, as is the jzexe
 program to create a standalone executable by gluing a Z-code file to
 jzip.

 For other Z-Code interpreters, also see the frotz, xzip, fizmo, and
 gargoyle-free packages in Debian.  The current list of interpreters
