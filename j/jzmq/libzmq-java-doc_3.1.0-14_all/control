Description: Documentation for ZeroMQ Java bindings (jzmq)
 ZeroMQ is a library which extends the standard socket interfaces with features
 traditionally provided by specialised messaging middleware products.
 .
 ZeroMQ sockets provide an abstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple
 messaging patterns, message filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to
 multiple transport protocols and more.
 .
 This package contains JavaDoc documentation for the Java bindings for ZeroMQ.
