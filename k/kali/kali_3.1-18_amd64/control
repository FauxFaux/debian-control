Description: Draw tilings, frieze patterns, and so on
 You can use Kali to draw Escher-like tilings, infinite knots, frieze
 patterns, and other cool stuff. It lets you draw patterns in any of the 17
 planar (wallpaper) or 7 frieze symmetry groups. Drawings are done
 interactively with X, and PostScript output is supported.
