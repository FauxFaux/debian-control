Description: SQL helper application for Kannel WAP and SMS gateway
 Kannel is a gateway for connecting WAP (Wireless Application Protocol)
 phones to the Internet. It also works as an SMS/SMPP gateway, for
 providing SMS based services for GSM phones.
 .
 Sqlbox is a special Kannel box that sits between bearerbox and smsbox
 and uses a database queue to store and forward messages.
 .
 Messages are queued on a configurable table (defaults to send_sms) and
 moved to another table (defaults to sent_sms) afterwards.
 .
 You can also manually insert messages into the send_sms table and they
 will be sent and moved to the sent_sms table as well. This allows for
 fast and easy injection of large amounts of messages into Kannel.
