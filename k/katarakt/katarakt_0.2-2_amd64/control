Description: simple PDF viewer with two layouts
 It's a PDF viewer. It views PDFs.
 .
 There are currently two layouts. The presentation layout is very
 simple and only supports scrolling on a per page basis. As the name
 suggests the current page is displayed in the center and zoomed to
 fit the window. It is active by default.
 .
 The grid layout is much more advanced and offers continuous (smooth,
 per pixel) scrolling, zooming and adjusting the column count. Pages
 keep their correct relative size and are shown in a grid.
