Description: higher level API to Apache Zookeeper (Python 3)
 Kazoo features:
 .
  * A wide range of recipe implementations, like Lock, Election or Queue
  * Data and Children Watchers
  * Simplified Zookeeper connection state tracking
  * Unified asynchronous API for use with greenlets or threads
  * Support for gevent 0.13 and gevent 1.0
  * Support for Zookeeper 3.3 and 3.4 servers
  * Integrated testing helpers for Zookeeper clusters
  * Pure-Python based implementation of the wire protocol, avoiding all the
    memory leaks, lacking features, and debugging madness of the C library
 .
 Kazoo is heavily inspired by Netflix Curator simplifications and helpers.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version of the package.
