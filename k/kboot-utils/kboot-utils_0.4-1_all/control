Description: helper tools to generate a kboot.conf file
 kboot-utils provides helper tools to automatically generate a kboot.conf file
 from entries in /boot.
 .
 kboot.conf is used for instance by the petitboot bootloader, which is used on
 the Sony PlayStation 3 in OtherOS mode; petitboot reads the file from the root
 filesystem in order to list kernels to boot.
