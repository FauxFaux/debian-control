Description: Kross Core Library
 Kross is a scripting bridge for the KDE Development Platform used to embed
 scripting functionality into an application. Kross provides an abstract API to
 provide scripting functionality in a interpreter-independent way. The
 application that uses Kross should not need to know anything about the
 scripting language being used.
 .
 The core of Kross provides the framework to deal transparently with
 interpreter-backends and offers abstract functionality to deal with scripts.
 .
 This package is part of the KDE Development Platform libraries module.
