Description: Porting aid from KDELibs4.
 This framework provides code and utilities to ease
 the transition from kdelibs 4 to KDE Frameworks 5.
 This includes CMake macros and C++ classes whose
 functionality has been replaced by code in CMake,
 Qt and other frameworks.
 .
 Code should aim to port away from this framework eventually.
 The API documentation of the classes in this framework and
 the notes at <http://community.kde.org/Frameworks/Porting_Notes>
 should help with this.
 .
 This package contains the data files used by kdelibs4support.
