Description: library for handling address book data
 This library provides an API for address book data. It includes features
 such as:
  * Value based interface, addressbook entry data is implicitly shared.
  * Address book entries are identified by a unique id.
  * vCard backend (RFC 2425 / RFC 2426).
  * Locking mechanism to support concurrent access to the address book by
    multiple processes.
  * Notification on change of addressbook by other process.
  * Dialog for selecting address book entries, supports mouse and keyboard
    selection, supports automatic name completion.
  * GUI client for viewing, modifying address book data. This is aimed at
    developers not end users.
  * Tool for converting data, written with libkab, to libkabc format.
  * Multiple backends (resources) for storing entries e.g. LDAP
 .
 This package is part of the KDE Development Platform PIM libraries module.
