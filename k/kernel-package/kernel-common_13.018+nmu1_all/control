Description: common elements for generated kernel packages
 This package provides the common elements that are useful for the
 package generated by kernel-package, but which may be installed on
 machines that kernel-package is not itself installed on, for instance,
 manual pages pertaining to the kernel image packages
 .
 It also contains example scripts that may be use when installed in
 /etc/kernel/*.d directories, to take action when the kernel image or
 header packages are installed.
