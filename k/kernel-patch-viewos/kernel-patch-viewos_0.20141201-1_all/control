Description: View-OS - Kernel patch for better UMView performances
 View-OS is a novel approach to the process/kernel interface.  The semantics of
 each system call can be assigned process by process giving the user the right
 to decide which view of the system each process has to join.  Each process can
 "see" a different file system structure, networking resources, processor,
 devices.  Moreover some of the resources can be provided by the user
 him/herself, thus these resource can be private to the single process and are
 not known a priori by the system.  Groups of processes can share the same view
 but this is just an optimization to share management methods.

 This package contains a couple of kernel patches that should be used together
 with UMView.  Though not required, they consent dramatic improvements in
 performances.  These patches are quite general and can also be used by other
 virtualization software (as User Mode Linux, or everything that uses the
 ptrace() system call) to increase performances.
