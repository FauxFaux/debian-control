Description: map pairs of simultaneously pressed keys to commands
 This package permits an Emacs user to map commands to simultaneously
 pressed keys.  This can be done buffer-local or globally.
 .
 In this package, a "key chord" is two keys pressed simultaneously, or
 a single key quickly pressed twice.
 .
 (Sometimes pressing SHIFT and/or META plus another key is call a
 chord, but not here. However SHIFT plus two normal keys can be a "key
 chord".)
