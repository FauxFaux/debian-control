Description: Keyboard map decision tree builder and interpreter
 This package implements an alternate way to let a user decide which
 keyboard map to use. It generates a decision tree and then asks the
 user to press a couple of keys. Depending on which keycode is returned,
 the list of possible keyboards is pruned until there is only one left.
