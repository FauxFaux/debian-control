Description: Footprint symbols for KiCad's Pcbnew
 Pcbnew is a powerful printed circuit board software and part of the
 KiCad suite.
 Pcbnew manages libraries of footprints for components or other abstract
 elements. Each footprint is a drawing of the physical component including its
 land pattern (e.g. the layout of pads on the circuit board).
 .
 This package is providing footprints for Pcbnew usable with KiCad >= 5.0.0.
