Description: Demo projects for kicad
 The KiCad projects within this package are various typical small use cases
 which can be used for study or also for build own projects on top of these
 existing projects.
 .
 The projects included are on one side easy and simple projects with classical
 through hole mounted components with one or two layers but also rather more
 complex projects based on surface mounted devices (SMD) with multiple layers.
