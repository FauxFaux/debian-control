Description: Virtual package providing common used libraries by kicad
 This package contains dependencies on the component libraries (schematics
 and footprints), and also on the templates that are used in KiCad.
 .
 If you prefer to control the installation of the dependent packages
  * kicad-footprint
  * kicad-symbols
  * kicad-templates
 you should not install kicad-libraries and install one or more of the above
 packages.
 .
 Note! 3D model libraries are not set as a dependency due the installation
 size of this package, if you want to use the 3D models you need to install
 kicad-packages3d separately.
