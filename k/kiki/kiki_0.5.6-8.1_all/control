Description: tool for python regular expression testing
 A free environment for regular expression testing (ferret).  It allows
 you to write regexes and test them against a sample text, providing
 extensive output about the results. It is useful for several purposes:
 .
  - exploring and understanding the structure of match objects
    generated by the re module, making Kiki a valuable tool for people
    new to regexes.
  - testing regexes on sample text before deploying them in code.
 .
 Kiki can function on its own or as plugin for the Spe Python editor.
Python-Version: 2.7
