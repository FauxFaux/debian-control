Description: Models and model-drivers for KIM-API
 The KIM API is an Application Programming Interface for atomistic simulations.
 The API provides a standard for exchanging information between atomistic
 simulation codes (molecular dynamics, molecular statics, lattice dynamics,
 Monte Carlo, etc.) and interatomic models (potentials or force fields).
 It also includes a set of library routines for using the API with
 bindings for:
 .
 FORTRAN 77, Fortran 90/95, Fortran 2003
 C, C++
 .
 Atomistic simulation codes that support the KIM API work seamlessly with the
 KIM-compliant interatomic models (KIM Models) distributed on this website.
 The interface is computationally efficient and often requires relatively minor
 changes to existing codes.
 .
 This package contains models and model-drivers for KIM-API
