Description: Documentation for the (syntax-)tree-handling tool Kimwitu++
 Kimwitu++ is a system that supports the construction of programs that use
 trees or terms as their main data structure.  It allows you to define, store
 and operate on trees with typed nodes. Each type of node has a specific number
 of sons, and expects these sons to have specific types.  The most popular
 example of such trees are syntax trees.

 This is the documentation for Kimwitu++ in PDF and HTML format.
