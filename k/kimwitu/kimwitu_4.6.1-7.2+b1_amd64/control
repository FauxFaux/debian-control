Description: Compiler development tool, complementary to lex and yacc
 Kimwitu (pronounced kee'mweetoo) is a system that supports
 the construction of programs that use trees or terms as
 their main data structure. It is a ‘meta-tool’ in the
 development process of tools.
 .
 It can easily be interfaced with Yacc and Lex – the idea
 is that yacc and lex are used to do the parsing, and
 Kimwitu routines are used to built and manipulate the
 parse tree.
 .
 There is also Kimwitu++ (also packaged for Debian) which interfaces
 with C++ instead of C.
