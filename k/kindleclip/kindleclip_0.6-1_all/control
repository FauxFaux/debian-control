Description: User interface for managing Amazon Kindle's "My Clippings" file
 Amazon Kindle devices store a "My Clippings.txt" file, where the
 bookmarks, highlights and notes are kept. This application allows you
 to search within the clippings, filter the contents, and copy and
 paste to other applications.

 This program is in no way endorsed, promoted or should be associated
 with Amazon. It is not –and does not aim to be– an official Kindle
 project.
