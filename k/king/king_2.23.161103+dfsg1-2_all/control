Description: interactive system for three-dimensional vector graphics
 KiNG (Kinemage, Next Generation) is an interactive system for
 three-dimensional vector graphics. It supports a set of graphics
 primitives that make it suitable for many types of graphs, plots, and
 other illustrations; although its first use was to display
 macromolecular structures for biophysical research. KiNG builds on Mage,
 JavaMage, and the "kinemage" (kinetic image) concept to deliver a
 full-featured Java application with a user-friendly interface and
 integrated editing features. The KiNG jar file can be used within a web
 page as a Java applet or Java object to promote easy access to kinemages
 or coordinate files from a web browser.
