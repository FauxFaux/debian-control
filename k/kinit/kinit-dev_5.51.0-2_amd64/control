Description: process launcher to speed up launching KDE applications
 kdeinit is a process launcher somewhat similar to the
 famous init used for booting UNIX.
 .
 It launches processes by forking and then loading a
 dynamic library which should contain a 'kdemain(...)'
 function.
 .
 Using kdeinit to launch KDE applications makes starting
 a typical KDE applications 2.5 times faster (100ms
 instead of 250ms on a P-III 500) It reduces memory
 consumption by approx. 350Kb per application.
 .
 Contains development files for kinit.
