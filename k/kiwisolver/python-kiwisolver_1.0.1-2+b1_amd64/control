Description: fast implementation of the Cassowary constraint solver - Python 2.X
 Kiwi is an efficient C++ implementation of the Cassowary constraint solving
 algorithm. Kiwi is an implementation of the algorithm based on the seminal
 Cassowary paper. It is *not* a refactoring of the original C++ solver. Kiwi
 has been designed from the ground up to be lightweight and fast. Kiwi ranges
 from 10x to 500x faster than the original Cassowary solver with typical use
 cases gaining a 40x improvement. Memory savings are consistently > 5x.
 .
 In addition to the C++ solver, Kiwi ships with hand-rolled Python bindings.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 version of kiwisolver.
