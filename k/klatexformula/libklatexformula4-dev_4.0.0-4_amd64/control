Description: Runtime libraries for klatexformula, development files
 With Klatexformula, just enter a formula and click "Evaluate" to get an image
 of a LaTeX formula. You can drag&drop, copy or save the resulting image
 directly from the GUI, which makes klatexformula a very convenient tool for
 presentations. Klatexformula also provides also tools for equation prototyping
 in LaTeX and a user-library of used equations.
 .
 This package contains the header files for klatexformula libraries, and a Qt
 Designer plugin to help developers use the provided user interface elements.
