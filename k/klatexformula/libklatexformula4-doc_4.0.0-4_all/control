Description: Runtime libraries for klatexformula, API documentation
 With Klatexformula, just enter a formula and click "Evaluate" to get an image
 of a LaTeX formula. You can drag&drop, copy or save the resulting image
 directly from the GUI, which makes klatexformula a very convenient tool for
 presentations. Klatexformula also provides also tools for equation prototyping
 in LaTeX and a user-library of used equations.
 .
 This package contains API documentation for developers who wish to use the
 klatexformula libraries klftools and klfbackend.
