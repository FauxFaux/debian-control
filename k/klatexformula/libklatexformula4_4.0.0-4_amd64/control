Description: Runtime libraries for klatexformula
 With Klatexformula, just enter a formula and click "Evaluate" to get an image
 of a LaTeX formula. You can drag&drop, copy or save the resulting image
 directly from the GUI, which makes klatexformula a very convenient tool for
 presentations. Klatexformula also provides also tools for equation prototyping
 in LaTeX and a user-library of used equations.

 This package provides the libraries klatexformula is based on.
