Description: small utilities built with klibc for early boot
 This package contains a collection of programs that are linked
 against klibc. These duplicate some of the functionality of a
 regular Linux toolset, but are typically much smaller than their
 full-function counterparts.  They are intended for inclusion in
 initramfs images and embedded systems.
