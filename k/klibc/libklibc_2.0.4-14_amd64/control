Description: minimal libc subset for use with initramfs
 klibc is intended to be a minimalistic libc subset for use with
 initramfs.  It is deliberately written for small size, minimal
 entanglement, and portability, not speed.  It is definitely a work in
 progress, and a lot of things are still missing.
