Description: in- and out-of-core kmer counting and utilities (development lib)
 meryl computes the kmer content of genomic sequences.  Kmer
 content is represented as a list of kmers and the number of
 times each occurs in the input sequences.  The kmer can be
 restricted to only the forward kmer, only the reverse kmer,
 or the canonical kmer (lexicographically smaller of the
 forward and reverse kmer at each location).  Meryl can
 report the histogram of counts, the list of kmers and their
 counts, or can perform mathematical and set operations
 on the processed data files.
