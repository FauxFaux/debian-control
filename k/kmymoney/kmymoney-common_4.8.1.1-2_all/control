Description: KMyMoney architecture independent files
 KMyMoney is the Personal Finance Manager for KDE. It operates similar to
 MS-Money and Quicken, supports different account types, categorisation of
 expenses, QIF import/export, multiple currencies and initial online banking
 support.
 .
 This package contains architecture independent files needed for KMyMoney to
 run properly. It also provides KMyMoney documentation. Therefore, unless you
 have 'kmymoney' package installed, you will hardly find this package useful.
