Description: Graphical threaded news reader
 Knews is an X11 based thread-oriented news reader.  It is capable of
 representing threads as a graphical tree, represents quotations with
 different colors and much more.
 .
 Also included here is knewsd, a tiny NNTP daemon which can read news
 from a spool directory or even from a mail folder hierarchy, for use
 when you don't have a real server available.  There is no guarantee
 that it will work with any client other than knews, so it is not
 packaged separately.
