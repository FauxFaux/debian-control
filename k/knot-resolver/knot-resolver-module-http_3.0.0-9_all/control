Description: HTTP/2 module for Knot Resolver
 The Knot DNS Resolver is a caching full resolver implementation
 written in C and LuaJIT, including both a resolver library and a
 daemon. Modular architecture of the library keeps the core tiny and
 efficient, and provides a state-machine like API for
 extensions. There are three built-in modules - iterator, cache,
 validator, and many external.
 .
 This package contains HTTP/2 module for local visualization of the
 resolver cache and queries.
