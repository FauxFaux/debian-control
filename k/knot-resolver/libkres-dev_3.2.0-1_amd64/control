Description: caching, DNSSEC-validating DNS resolver (shared library development files)
 The Knot DNS Resolver is a caching full resolver implementation
 written in C and LuaJIT, including both a resolver library and a
 daemon. Modular architecture of the library keeps the core tiny and
 efficient, and provides a state-machine like API for
 extensions.
