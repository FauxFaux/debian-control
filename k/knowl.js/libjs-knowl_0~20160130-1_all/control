Description: JavaScript library for transclusion of supplementary information
 Like the familiar hyperlink, knowls can be used to provide relevant,
 supplementary information and are referenced from within the body of a web
 page. But unlike the hyperlink, which simply takes you to a new web page, the
 knowl conveniently serves up the information at your original location with the
 click of a mouse button. With a similar click, the knowl then disappears.
