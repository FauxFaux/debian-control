Description: RPM-based build system - server components
 The Fedora Project uses Koji for their build system, as do several other
 projects.
 .
 Koji's goal is to provide a flexible, secure, and reproducible way to build
 software.
 .
 Key features:
 .
  -  New buildroot for each build
  -  Robust XML-RPC APIs for easy integration with other tools
  -  Web interface with SSL and Kerberos authentication
  -  Thin, portable command line client
  -  Users can create local buildroots
  -  Buildroot contents are tracked in the database
  -  Versioned data
 .
 This package contains the server components of the koji build system.
 .
  - koji-hub, the center of all Koji operations. It is an XML-RPC server
    running under mod_wsgi in Apache.
  - kojid is the build daemon that runs on each of the build machines.
  - koji-web is a set of scripts that run in mod_wsgi and use the Cheetah
    templating engine to provide a web interface to Koji.
  - kojira is a daemon that keeps the build root repodata updated.
