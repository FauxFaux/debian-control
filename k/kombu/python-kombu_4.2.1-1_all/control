Description: AMQP Messaging Framework for Python
 The aim of Kombu is to make messaging in Python as easy as possible by
 providing an idiomatic high-level interface for the AMQP protocol. It is meant
 to replace the carrot library by providing a compatibility layer.
 .
 Features:
  * Allows application authors to support several message server solutions by
    using pluggable transports.
  * Supports automatic encoding, serialization and compression of message
    payloads.
  * The ability to ensure that an operation is performed by gracefully handling
    connection and channel errors.
