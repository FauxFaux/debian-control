Description: Complete and feature rich groupware solution - presence daemon
 A daemon for collecting and exporting user presence information across
 multiple protocols in a unified way.
 Supports XMPP and Spreed. Clients can both query the daemon with presence
 information (for example, the user is 'available' for XMPP and 'away' for
 Spreed) and update presence information (for example, make a user 'available'
 on Spreed). Queries and updates are performed with simple GET and PUT
 requests, respectively, using a simple (and identical) JSON format.
