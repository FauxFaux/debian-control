Description: command line interface to KeePassX password manager databases
 kpcli is an interactive command line shell to work with KeePass 1.x/2.x
 database files. Users can navigate and modify the database in imitated
 filesystem like shell syntax. This program was inspired by the interface
 provided by the KED password manager ("kedpm -c").
