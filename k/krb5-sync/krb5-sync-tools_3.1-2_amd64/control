Description: Kerberos Active Directory synchronization tools
 Provides tools to enable, disable, and set the password of an account in
 a Windows Active Directory using the same configuration used by the
 krb5-sync-plugin package.  These supporting tools are normally used to
 handle queued changes created by the plugin that failed due to a
 temporary error, but can be used on their own.
