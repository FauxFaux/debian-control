Description: MIT Kerberos key server (KDC) LDAP plugin
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a
 third party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").
 .
 This is the MIT reference implementation of Kerberos V5.
 .
 This package contains the LDAP plugin for the Kerberos key server (KDC)
 and supporting utilities.  This plugin allows the KDC data to be stored
 in an LDAP server rather than the default local database.  It should be
 installed on both master and slave KDCs that use LDAP as a storage
 backend.
