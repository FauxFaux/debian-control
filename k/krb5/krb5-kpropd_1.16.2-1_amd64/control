Description: MIT Kerberos key server (Slave KDC Support)
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a
 third party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").
 .
 This is the MIT reference implementation of Kerberos V5.
 .
 This package contains the Kerberos slave KDC update server (kpropd). The
 kpropd command runs on the slave KDC server. It listens for update requests
 made by the kprop program, and periodically requests incremental updates from
 the master KDC. This package should be installed on slave KDCs.
