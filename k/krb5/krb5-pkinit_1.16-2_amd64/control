Description: PKINIT plugin for MIT Kerberos
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a
 third party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").
 .
 This is the MIT reference implementation of Kerberos V5.
 .
 This package contains a plugin for the PKINIT protocol, which allows
 Kerberos tickets to be obtained using public-key credentials such as
 X.509 certificates or a smart card.  This plugin can be used by the
 client libraries and the KDC.
