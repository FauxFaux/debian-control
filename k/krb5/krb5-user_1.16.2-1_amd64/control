Description: basic programs to authenticate using MIT Kerberos
 Kerberos is a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
 Kerberos is a trusted third-party service.  That means that there is a
 third party (the Kerberos server) that is trusted by all the entities on
 the network (users and services, usually called "principals").
 .
 This is the MIT reference implementation of Kerberos V5.
 .
 This package contains the basic programs to authenticate to MIT Kerberos,
 change passwords, and talk to the admin server (to create and delete
 principals, list principals, etc.).
