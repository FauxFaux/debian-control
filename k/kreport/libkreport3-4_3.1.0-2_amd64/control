Description: report creation and generation framework -- shared library
 The KReport framework implements reporting functionality for creation
 of reports in MS Access style. They are also similar to SAP Crystal Reports
 and FileMaker reports.
 .
 Reports can be created interactively and programmatically. They can be
 previewed on screen, printed, and saved in a variety of formats such as
 HTML, PDF and OpenDocument.
 .
 Reports of this kind offer a way to view, format, and summarize the
 information. For example a simple report of contact phone numbers can be
 prepared, or a more complex report on sales for different products, regions,
 and periods of time.
 .
 A report is often filled with information from a database. There are many
 use cases:
  * The data can be displayed, summarized, sorted and grouped
  * Totals can be computed and displayed
  * Single or multiple records of data can be placed on a page
  * Details for individual data records can be placed in a layout
  * Labels can be created
  * The various report sections, such as title, header or footer, can be sized
    to suit
  * Reports can be generated on demand, thus eliminating saving them in files
    for further use
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

 This package is part of the Calligra Suite.
