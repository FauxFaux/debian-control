Description: kronosnet core switching implementation
 Kronosnet, often referred to as knet, is a network
 abstraction layer designed for High Availability use cases, where redundancy,
 security, fault tolerance and fast fail-over are the core requirements of
 your application.
 .
 Kronosnet is the new underlying network protocol for Linux HA components
 (Corosync), that features ability to use multiple links between nodes,
 active/active and active/passive link failover policies, automatic link
 recovery, FIPS compliant encryption (nss and/or openssl), automatic PMTUd and
 in general better performances compared to the old network protocol.
 .
 This package contains libraries that are used by libknet clients.
