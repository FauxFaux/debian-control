Description: Tycho-2 star catalog for KStars
 This package contains the data of the Tycho-2 star catalog for
 KStars, the desktop planetarium for KDE. It allows users to share a
 single centralized installation of the data instead of each needing
 to download their own personal copy of the whole catalog. It can
 also configure KStars to disable these user downloads.
