Description: Syntax highlighting Engine - translations
 This is a stand-alone implementation of the Kate syntax
 highlighting engine. It's meant as a building block for
 text editors as well as for simple highlighted text
 rendering (e.g. as HTML), supporting both integration
 with a custom editor as well as a ready-to-use
 QSyntaxHighlighter sub-class.
 .
 This package provides the translations.
