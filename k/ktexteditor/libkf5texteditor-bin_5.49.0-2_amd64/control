Description: provide advanced plain text editing services (binaries)
 The KTextEditor interfaces - also called KTE interfaces - are a set
 of well-defined interfaces which an application or library can
 implement to provide advanced plain text editing
 services. Applications which utilise this interface can thus allow
 the user to choose which implementation of the editor component to
 use. The only implementation right now is the Kate Editor Component
 (Kate Part).
 .
 This package contains the helper binaries.
