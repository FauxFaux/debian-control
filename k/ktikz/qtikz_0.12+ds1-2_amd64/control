Description: editor for the TikZ drawing language - Qt version
 QtikZ is a small application to assist in the creation of diagrams and
 drawings using the TikZ macros from the LaTeX package "pgf". It consists of
 a text editor pane in which the TikZ code for the drawing is edited and a
 preview pane showing the drawing as rendered by LaTeX. The preview pane can be
 updated in real-time. Common drawing tools, options and styles are available
 from the menus to assist the coding process.
 .
 This package contains the Qt version of the program.
 .
 TikZ is a user-friendly syntax layer for the PGF (portable graphics format)
 TeX macro package. Pictures can be created within a LaTeX document and
 included in the output using the most important TeX backend drivers including
 pdftex and dvips.
