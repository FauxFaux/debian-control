Description: command line interface to the KDE Wallet
 kwalletcli implements a command line interface tool to get and set
 password entries in the default KDE Wallet. Also included are a shell
 wrapper around pinentry, a pinentry-kwallet application checking the
 KDE Wallet for the passphrase requested before asking the user for
 use with the GnuPG Agent, which is also capable of running without
 a pinentry as backend, and kwalletaskpass, which can store SSH key
 passphrases in the KDE Wallet for use with the OpenSSH Agent, and
 is registered as ssh-askpass alternative.
