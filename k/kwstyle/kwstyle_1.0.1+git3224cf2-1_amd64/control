Description: Style checker for source code
 KWStyle is integrated in the software process to ensure that the code written
 by several users is consistent and can be viewed/printed as it was written by
 one person.
 .
 KWStyle is primarily checking C/C++ source code but can be easily extended to
 other languages. It assumes that the code is syntactically correct, i.e., it
 compiles on a standard compiler.
