Description: Key exchange daemon
 kxd is a key exchange daemon, which serves blobs of data (keys) over https.
 .
 It can be used to get keys remotely instead of using local storage. The main
 use case is to get keys to open dm-crypt devices automatically, without having
 to store them on the local machine.
