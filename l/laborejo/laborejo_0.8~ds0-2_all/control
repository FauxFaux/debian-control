Description: music notation workshop
 Laborejo, Esperanto for "Workshop", is used to craft
 music through notation. It is a Lilypond GUI frontend,
 a MIDI creator and finally a tool collection to inspire
 and help one to compose music. It works by reducing
 music-redundancy and by seperating layout and data.
 .
 Laborejo provides many features:
  * Unlimited tracks/staffs, voices, items.
  * Input via Keyboard, Mouse or MIDI.
  * Flexibel and fast shortcut and configuring system.
  * Portable, as few dependencies as possible.
  * PDF generation, ready-to-print, through Lilypond.
  * Separation of editing and note/data entry and layout.
  * MIDI file generation.
  * Playback through JACK.
  * Control over performance from a global level (e.g.
    change how long non-legato notes or fermatas are) to
    detailed, technical tweaks like MIDI CC messages as
    score items.
