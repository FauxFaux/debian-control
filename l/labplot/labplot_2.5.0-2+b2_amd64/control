Description: interactive graphing and analysis of scientific data
 LabPlot provides an easy way to create, manage and edit plots.  It allows you
 to produce plots based on data from a spreadsheet or on data imported from
 external files.  Plots can be exported to several pixmap and vector graphic
 formats.
 .
 Features include:
  - project-based management of data
  - project explorer for management and organization of created objects in
    different folders and sub-folders
  - spreadsheet with basic functionality for manual data entry or for
    generation of uniform and non-uniform random numbers
  - import of external ASCII data into the project for further editing and
    visualization
  - export of spreadsheet to an ASCII file
  - worksheet as the main parent object for plots, labels, etc; supports
    different layouts and zooming functions
  - export of worksheet to different formats (PDF, EPS, PNG, and SVG)
  - great variety of editing capabilities for properties of worksheet and its
    objects
  - cartesian plots, created either from imported or manually created data
    sets or via mathematical equation
  - definition of mathematical formulas is supported by syntax highlighting
    and completion and by the list of thematically grouped mathematical and
    physical constants and functions
  - analysis of plotted data is supported by many zooming and navigation
    features
  - linear and non-linear fits to data, several fit-models are predefined and
    custom models with arbitrary number of parameters can be provided
