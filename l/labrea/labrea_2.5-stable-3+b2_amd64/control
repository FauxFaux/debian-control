Description: a "sticky" honeypot and IDS
 LaBrea takes over unused IP addresses, and creates virtual servers
 that are attractive to worms, crackers, and other denizens of the
 Internet.
 .
 The program answers connection attempts in such a way that the
 machine at the other end gets "stuck", sometimes for a very long
 time.
