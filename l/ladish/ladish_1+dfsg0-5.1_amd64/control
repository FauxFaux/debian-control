Description: session management system for JACK applications
 LADI Session Handler or simply ladish is a session management
 system for JACK applications on GNU/Linux. Its aim is to allow
 you to have many different audio programs running at once, to
 save their setup, close them down and then easily reload the
 setup at some other time. ladish doesn't deal with any kind of
 audio or MIDI data itself; it just runs programs, deals with
 saving/loading (arbitrary) data and connects JACK ports
 together. It can also be used to move entire sessions between
 computers, or post sessions on the Internet for download.
