Description: the LADR deduction library
 LADR (Library for Automated Deduction Research) is a library for
 use in constructing theorem provers.  Among other useful routines it
 provides facilities for applying inference rules such as resolution
 and paramodulation to clauses.  LADR is used by the prover9 theorem
 prover, and by the mace4 countermodel generator.
