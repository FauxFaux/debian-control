Description: highly parametrizable pairwise global genome sequence aligner
 Lagan takes local alignments generated by CHAOS as anchors, and limits
 the search area of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm around these anchors.
 .
 Multi-LAGAN is a generalization of the pairwise algorithm to multiple
 sequence alignment.  M-LAGAN performs progressive pairwise alignments,
 guided by a user-specified phylogenetic tree. Alignments are aligned to
 other alignments using the sum-of-pairs metric.
