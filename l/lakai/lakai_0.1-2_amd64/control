Description: transfers samples between a PC and an AKAI sampler
 Lakai is a small set of tools (+ a link library) used to transfer sampler
 data (programs, samples) between a PC with a SCSI host adapter and an AKAI
 sampler (S1000, S2000..).
 .
 The current tools allow an easy way to create a full backup of the sampler's
 memory contents to the PC and a full restore of this data back from the PC to
 the sampler.
 .
 Future versions might contain more fine-grained control over the data you
 exchange, but this is still in planning stage.
