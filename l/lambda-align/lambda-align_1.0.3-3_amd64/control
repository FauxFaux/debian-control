Description: Local Aligner for Massive Biological DatA
 Lambda is a local biosequence aligner optimized for many query sequences
 and searches in protein space. It is compatible to the de facto standard tool
 BLAST, but often outperforms the best currently available alternatives at
 reproducing BLASTâ€™s results and is the fastest compared with the current
 state of the art at comparable levels of sensitivity.
