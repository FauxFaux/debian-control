Description: Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines 3, testing programs
 BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines) is a set of efficient
 routines for most of the basic vector and matrix operations.
 They are widely used as the basis for other high quality linear
 algebra software, for example lapack and linpack.  This
 implementation is the Fortran 77 reference implementation found
 at netlib.
 .
 This package contains a set of programs which test the integrity of an
 installed blas-compatible shared library. These programs may therefore be used
 to test the libraries provided by the blas package as well as those provided
 by the libatlas3-base and libopenblas-base packages. The programs are
 dynamically linked -- one can explicitly select a library to test by setting
 the libblas.so.3 alternative, or by using the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or LD_PRELOAD
 environment variables. Likewise, one can display the library selected using
 the ldd program in an identical environment.
