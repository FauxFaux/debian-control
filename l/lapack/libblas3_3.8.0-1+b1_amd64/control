Description: Basic Linear Algebra Reference implementations, shared library
 BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines) is a set of efficient
 routines for most of the basic vector and matrix operations.
 They are widely used as the basis for other high quality linear
 algebra software, for example lapack and linpack.  This
 implementation is the Fortran 77 reference implementation found
 at netlib.
 .
 This package contains a shared version of the library.
