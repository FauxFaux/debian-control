Description: Library of linear algebra routines 3 - static PIC version
 LAPACK version 3.X is a comprehensive FORTRAN library that does
 linear algebra operations including matrix inversions, least
 squared solutions to linear sets of equations, eigenvector
 analysis, singular value decomposition, etc. It is a very
 comprehensive and reputable package that has found extensive
 use in the scientific community.
 .
 Normally one would want to use non-PIC code for static linking.  In
 this case, install liblapack-dev.  This package is provided for other
 packages, such as ATLAS, needing access to PIC versions of the lapack
 objects in their own build process.
