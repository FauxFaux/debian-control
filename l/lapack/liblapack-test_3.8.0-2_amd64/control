Description: Library of linear algebra routines 3 - testing programs
 LAPACK version 3.X is a comprehensive FORTRAN library that does
 linear algebra operations including matrix inversions, least
 squared solutions to linear sets of equations, eigenvector
 analysis, singular value decomposition, etc. It is a very
 comprehensive and reputable package that has found extensive
 use in the scientific community.
 .
 These testing programs have been run against the
 shared library in the lapack package.  The results have been
 collected in the files test_results.  These
 programs are provided separately here so that the user can
 test and compare alternate versions of the lapack libraries,
 such as those provided by the ATLAS packages, and the lapack
