Description: deep learning library build on the top of Theano (Python2 modules)
 Lasagne is a Python library to build and train deep (multi-layered) artificial
 neural networks on the top of Theano (math expression compiler). In comparison
 to other abstraction layers for that like e.g. Keras, it abstracts Theano as
 little as possible.
 .
 Lasagne supports networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN, mostly used
 for image recognition resp. classification) and the Long Short-Term Memory type
 (LSTM, a subtype of Recurrent Neural Networks, RNN).
  .
 This package contains the modules for Python 2.
