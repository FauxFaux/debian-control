Description: A tool for developers to visualize system latencies
 LatencyTOP is a Linux tool for software developers (both kernel
 and userspace), aimed at identifying where in the system latency
 is happening, and what kind of operation/action is causing the
 latency to happen so that the code can be changed to avoid the
 worst latency hiccups.
