Description: type1 and tfm DNP Japanese fonts for latex-cjk
 This package installs Type1 and TFM fonts from a DNP font called "Wadalab".
 You'll get three flavours: Mincho, Gothic and Maru.
 .
 DNP stands for "Dai Nippon Printing" (a big printing company in Japan).
 DNP fonts are commercial fonts made by this company; if real DNP fonts have
 been already installed at your site, you should use them.  But watanabe-dnp
 fonts (like Wadalab), which are customized from watanabe-jfonts to emulate
 DNP fonts, are freeware.  The method of emulation is symbolic name linking.
 .
 These Type1 fonts differ from those in the gsfonts-wadalab package, because
 CJK author Werner Lemberg has introduced some fixes.
