Description: easy compiling of complex (and simple) LaTeX documents
 This package provides several tools that aim to simplify the
 compilation of LaTeX documents:
 .
 LaTeX.mk: a Makefile snippet to help compiling LaTeX documents in
 DVI, PDF, PS, ... format. Dependencies are automatically tracked: one
 should be able to compile documents with a one-line Makefile
 containing 'include LaTeX.mk'. Complex documents (with multiple
 bibliographies, indexes, glossaries, ...) should be correctly managed.
 .
 figlatex.sty: a LaTeX package to easily insert xfig figures (with
 \includegraphics{file.fig}). It can interact with LaTeX.mk so that the
 latter automatically invokes fig2dev if needed.
 .
 And various helper tools for LaTeX.mk
