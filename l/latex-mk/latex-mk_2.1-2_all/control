Description: tool for managing LaTeX projects
 LaTeX-Mk is a collection of Makefile fragments and shell scripts for
 managing small to large sized LaTeX projects. The typical LaTeX-Mk
 input file is simply a series of variable definitions in a Makefile
 for the project. After creating a simple Makefile the user can easily
 perform all required steps to do such tasks as: preview the document,
 print the document, or produce a PDF file. LaTeX-Mk will keep track
 of files that have changed and how to run the various programs that
 are needed to produce the output.
