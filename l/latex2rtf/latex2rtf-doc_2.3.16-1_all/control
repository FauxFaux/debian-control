Description: Converts documents from LaTeX to RTF - documentation
 Attempts to convert as much formatting information as possible from
 LaTeX to Microsoft's Rich Text Format (RTF).  While RTF has limited
 support for mathematical markup, it is widely supported as a "least
 common denominator" word processing format.
 .
 This package includes the documentation for LaTeX2RTF in HTML, Info
 and PDF formats.
