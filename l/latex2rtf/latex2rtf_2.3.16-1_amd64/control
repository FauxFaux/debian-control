Description: Converts documents from LaTeX to RTF format
 Attempts to convert as much formatting information as possible from
 LaTeX to Microsoft's Rich Text Format (RTF).  While RTF has limited
 support for mathematical markup, it is widely supported as a "least
 common denominator" word processing format.
 .
 The detailed documentation is in the latex2rtf-doc package.
