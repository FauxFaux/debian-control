Description: smart search launcher for installed programs or files
 Launchy is the most efficient way to open files, folders, websites,
 and programs on your computer. Instead of having to browse the menus
 to find an application, Launchy is a smart search program which tries
 to guess which program or file you are looking for and will launch
 it when you hit the enter key. It runs in background and appears when
 the configured key combination is pressed (Ctrl+Space by default) or
 the tray icon is clicked.
