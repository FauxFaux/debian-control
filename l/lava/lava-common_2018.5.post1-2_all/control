Description: Linaro Automated Validation Architecture common
 LAVA is a continuous integration system for deploying operating
 systems onto physical and virtual hardware for running tests.
 Tests can be simple boot testing, bootloader testing and system
 level testing, although extra hardware may be required for some
 system tests. Results are tracked over time and data can be
 exported for further analysis.
 .
 This package contains common Python code to support lava-server
 and lava-dispatcher.
