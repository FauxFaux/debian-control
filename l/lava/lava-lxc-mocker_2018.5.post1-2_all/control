Description: Linaro Automated Validation Architecture LXC Mocker
 LAVA is a continuous integration system for deploying operating
 systems onto physical and virtual hardware for running tests.
 Tests can be simple boot testing, bootloader testing and system
 level testing, although extra hardware may be required for some
 system tests. Results are tracked over time and data can be
 exported for further analysis.
 .
 This package contains set of mocker scripts that mocks each of
 the lxc commands that LAVA uses. It does not support all commands
 and options that lxc provides, but just the ones that LAVA uses.
 Test jobs using LXC can then be replicated in Docker.
