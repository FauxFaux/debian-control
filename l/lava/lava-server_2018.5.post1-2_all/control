Description: Linaro Automated Validation Architecture server
 LAVA is a continuous integration system for deploying operating
 systems onto physical and virtual hardware for running tests.
 Tests can be simple boot testing, bootloader testing and system
 level testing. Extra hardware may be required for some
 system tests. Results are tracked over time and data can be
 exported for further analysis.
 .
 This package provides the Apache and WSGI configuration and LAVA
 support files to run the validation server on the local Apache
 instance as a lava-server virtual host as well as the scheduler
 and dispatcher.
 .
 This package no longer supports configuration as a
 remote worker and needs to be removed from existing workers.
 Workers must only install lava-dispatcher.
 .
 This package no longer supports Python2.
