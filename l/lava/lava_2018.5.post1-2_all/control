Description: Linaro Automated Validation Architecture metapackage
 LAVA is a continuous integration system for deploying operating
 systems onto physical and virtual hardware for running tests.
 Tests can be simple boot testing, bootloader testing and system
 level testing, although extra hardware may be required for some
 system tests. Results are tracked over time and data can be
 exported for further analysis.
 .
 This metapackage brings in all LAVA components on a single
 machine. Some suggested packages may not be available for all
 architectures.
