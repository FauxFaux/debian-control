Description: Lazarus Components Library - no GUI backend dependency package
 Lazarus is an IDE to create (graphical and console) applications with Free
 Pascal, the (L)GPLed Pascal and Object Pascal compiler that runs on
 Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and more.
 .
 Lazarus is the missing part of the puzzle that will allow you to develop
 programs for all of the above platforms in a Delphi-like environment.
 The IDE is a RAD tool that includes a form designer.
 .
 Unlike Java's "write once, run anywhere" motto, Lazarus and Free Pascal
 strive for "write once, compile anywhere". Since the exact same compiler
 is available on all of the above platforms you don't need to do any recoding
 to produce identical products for different platforms.
 .
 In short, Lazarus is a free RAD tool for Free Pascal using its Lazarus
 Component Library (LCL).
 .
 This dependency package always depends on the latest available version of
 the package containing the part of the LCL for developing non-graphical
 applications and command line tools.
