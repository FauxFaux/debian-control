Description: easily write objects that delegate behavior
 The ``lazr.delegates`` package makes it easy to write objects that delegate
 behavior to another object. The new object adds some property or behavior on
 to the other object, while still providing the underlying interface, and
 delegating behavior.
 .
 This is the common documentation package.
