Description: Local Centre Authorization Service development files
 LCAS makes binary ('yes' or 'no') authorization decisions at the site
 and resource level. In making this decision, it can use a variety of
 inputs: the 'grid' name of the user (the Subject Distinguished Name),
 any VO attributes the user has (like VOMS FQANs), the name of the
 executable the user intends to execute. It supports basic black and
 white list functionality, but also more complex VOMS-based
 expressions, based on the GACL language.
 .
 This package contains the development libraries.
