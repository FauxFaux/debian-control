Description: extra drivers for the LCD display driver daemon
 Lcdproc is a client/server suite including drivers for all kinds of
 nifty LCD displays. The server supports several serial devices: Matrix
 Orbital, Crystal Fontz, Bayrad, LB216, LCDM001 (kernelconcepts.de),
 Wirz-SLI and PIC-an-LCD; and some devices connected to the LPT port:
 HD44780, STV5730, T6963, SED1520 and SED1330. As of 0.4.4 some USB
 displays are also supported by the drivers CFonz633, CwLnx, and USBLCD.
 .
 This package contains the LCD drivers which need extra libraries to
 run such as USB, LIRC, SVGA, and the X Window System.
