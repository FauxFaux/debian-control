Description: Jobrepository plugin for the LCMAPS authorization framework
 The Local Centre MAPping Service (LCMAPS) is a security middleware
 component that processes the users Grid credentials (typically X.509
 proxy certificates and VOMS attributes) and maps the user to a local
 account based on the site local policy.
 .
 This package contains the LCMAPS jobrepository plug-in, which stores
 credentials and the resulting account mappings into a relational
 database. This plugin will link up all the known in-process information
 from LCMAPS core memory and store it in a database. This plug-in uses
 ODBC (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODBC) to connect to the database.
 .
 The current state of the mappings between various credentials and
 Unix accounts is stored in an open database on disk, but this
 information can change over time through (regular) system
 administrative interventions. This state is now preserved in a
 relational database with the added benefit of being accessible by
 other systems, e.g. GridSAFE and build-up an easy to backup historic
 view on the mapping state.
