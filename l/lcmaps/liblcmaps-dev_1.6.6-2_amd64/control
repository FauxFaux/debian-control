Description: LCMAPS development libraries
 The Local Centre MAPping Service (LCMAPS) is a security middleware
 component that processes the users Grid credentials (typically X.509
 proxy certificates and VOMS attributes) and maps the user to a local
 account based on the site local policy.
 .
 It is a highly configurable pluggable interface, and many plugins are
 available to tailor almost every need. Since this is middleware, it
 does not interact with the user directly; to use it in a program please
 see the lcmaps-*-interface packages.
 .
 This package contains the development libraries.
