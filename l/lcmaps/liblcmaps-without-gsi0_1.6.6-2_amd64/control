Description: Grid mapping service without GSI
 The Local Centre MAPping Service (LCMAPS) is a security middleware
 component that processes the users Grid credentials (typically X.509
 proxy certificates and VOMS attributes) and maps the user to a local
 account based on the site local policy.
 .
 It is a highly configurable pluggable interface, and many plugins are
 available to tailor almost every need. Since this is middleware, it
 does not interact with the user directly; to use it in a program please
 see the lcmaps-interface package.
 .
 This package contains an implementation without GSI protocol support.
