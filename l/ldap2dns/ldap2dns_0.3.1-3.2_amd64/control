Description: LDAP based DNS management system
 ldap2dns is a program to create DNS (Domain Name Service) records directly
 from a LDAP directory. It can and should be used to replace the secondary
 name-server by a second primary one. ldap2dns reduces all kind of
 administration overhead: No more flat file editing, no more zone file
 editing. After having installed ldap2dns, the administrator only has to
 access the LDAP directory.
 .
 ldap2dns is designed to write ASCII data files used by tinydns from the
 djbdns package, but also may be used to write .db-files used by named as
 found in the BIND package.
