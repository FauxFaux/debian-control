Description: LDAP-like embedded database - development files
 ldb is a LDAP-like embedded database built on top of TDB.
 .
 What ldb does is provide a fast database with an LDAP-like API designed
 to be used within an application. In some ways it can be seen as a
 intermediate solution between key-value pair databases and a real LDAP
 database.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
