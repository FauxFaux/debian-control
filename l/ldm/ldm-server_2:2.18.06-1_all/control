Description: server components for LTSP display manager
 ldm is an X11 display manager similar to xdm, gdm and kdm, but unlike
 those it wraps the X11 traffic within an SSH tunnel to provide a
 secure login mechanism for remote X sessions.
 .
 This package includes the server components used by ldm to discover
 available sessions and locales on the server. It also recommends
 packages relevant for local device access, a login session, and remote
 sound.
 .
 LTSP stands for 'Linux Terminal Server Project'.
