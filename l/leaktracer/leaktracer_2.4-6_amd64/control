Description: Simple and efficient memory-leak tracer for C++ programs
 LeakTracer traces calls to new and delete, and reports
 inconsistencies in the C++-level memory-management.
 .
 It has limitations (eg. when you override the new and delete
 operators yourself), but is very easy to use (eg. compared to more
 complete tools like mpatrol), traces the C++ level (unlike most other
 tools), and gives pretty good results.
 .
 It uses gdb to display source-file information.
