Description: command-line tool for managing LEAP platform service provider infrastrucutre
 The leap command line tool is used by sysadmins to manage everything about a
 service providerâ€™s infrastructure, including:
 .
        * Create, initialize, and deploy nodes.
        * Manage keys and certificates.
        * Query information about the node configurations.
        * Everything about your provider is managed by editing JSON
          configuration files and running leap commands.
 .
 The leap command-line tool is run on your workstation, and never on a server
 you are deploying to.
 .
 It is also run from within a provider instance: The leap command requires that
 the current working directory is a valid provider instance, except when running
 leap new to create a new provider instance.
