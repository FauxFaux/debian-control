Description: Reminds you when you have to leave
 Leave waits until the specified time, then reminds you that you have
 to leave.  You are reminded 5 minutes and 1 minute before the actual
 time, at the time, and every minute thereafter.  When you log off,
 leave exits just before it would have printed the next message.
