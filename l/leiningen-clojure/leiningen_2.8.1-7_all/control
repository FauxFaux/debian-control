Description: Automation tool and dependency manager for Clojure projects
 Working on Clojure projects with tools designed for Java can be an
 exercise in frustration. With Leiningen, you describe your build with
 Clojure. Leiningen handles fetching dependencies, running tests, packaging
 your projects and can be easily extended with a number of plugins.
