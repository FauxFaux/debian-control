Description: Lemonldap::NG FastCGI server
 Lemonldap::NG is a complete Web-SSO system that can run with reverse-proxies
 or directly on application webservers. It can be used in conjunction with
 OpenID-Connect, CAS and SAML systems as identity or service provider. It can
 also be used as proxy between those federation systems.
 .
 It manages both authentication and authorization and provides headers for
 accounting. So you can have a full AAA protection. Authorization are built by
 associating a regular expression and a rule. Regular expression is applied on
 the requested URL and the rule calculates if the user is authorized.
 .
 Lemonldap::NG FastCGI server provides a Nginx auth_request server.
