Description: Lens Correction library - Runtime files
 Lensfun is an opensource database of photographic lenses and their
 characteristics. It contains three kinds of objects:
  * mounts
  * cameras
  * lenses
 .
 It is used in various photo-related software in which it allows the
 correction of various artifacts:
  * distortion
  * transveral (also known as lateral) chromatic aberrations
  * vignetting
  * colour contribution of the lens (correcting said "yellowish" or "blueish"
    images)
 .
 It provides a way to read and search for specific things in the database.
 .
 This package contains the runtime files to access the library.
