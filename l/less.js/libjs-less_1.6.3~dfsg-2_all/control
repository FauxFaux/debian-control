Description: LESS CSS meta-language - Javascript library
 LESS is a meta-language on top of CSS thatâ€™s used to describe the style
 of a document cleanly and structurally, with more power than flat CSS
 allows.  LESS both provides a simpler, more elegant syntax for CSS and
 implements various features that are useful for creating manageable
 stylesheets.
 .
 less.js is the reference implementation of LESS, written in JavaScript.
 .
 This package contains the less.js library usable for dynamic parsing of
 LESS in a web browser.
