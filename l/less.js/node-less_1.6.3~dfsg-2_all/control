Description: LESS CSS meta-language - compiler and Node module
 Node is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
 .
 LESS is a meta-language on top of CSS thatâ€™s used to describe the style
 of a document cleanly and structurally, with more power than flat CSS
 allows.  LESS both provides a simpler, more elegant syntax for CSS and
 implements various features that are useful for creating manageable
 stylesheets.
 .
 less.js is the reference implementation of LESS, written in JavaScript.
 .
 This package contains less.js usable as Node module, and the script
 lessc for statically compiling LESS data into CSS.
