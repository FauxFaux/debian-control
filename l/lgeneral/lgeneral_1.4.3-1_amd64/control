Description: strategy game in the tradition of Panzer General
 LGeneral is a turn-based strategy game heavily inspired by Panzer General.
 You play single scenarios or whole campaigns turn by turn against a human
 player or the AI.
 .
 Entrenchment, rugged defense, defensive fire, surprise contacts, surrender,
 unit supply, weather influence, reinforcements and other implementations
 contribute to the tactical and strategic depth of the game.
 .
 This is the game engine only. LGeneral requires lgeneral-data or lgc-pg, which
 converts the game data of the original Panzer General game, to function
 properly.
