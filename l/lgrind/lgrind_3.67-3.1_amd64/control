Description: A pretty printer for various programming languages
 LGrind is a pretty printer for a large number of programming languages
 using LaTeX. It is in the form of a separate preprocessor.
 .
 The licence is non-free, as it contains a no-sale clause.
 You might consider using the listings package instead, which is free;
 it also claims to be able to read the language definitions of LGrind.
 LGrind's output tends to be prettier, though, especially if you prefer
 non-monospaced fonts.
