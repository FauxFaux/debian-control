Description: lzh archive decompressor
 Lhasa lha is a tool for parsing LHA (.lzh) archives and a free
 replacement for the Unix LHA tool.
 .
 Currently it is only possible to read from (ie. decompress) archives;
 generating (compressing) LHA archives may be an enhancement for future
 versions. The aim is to be compatible with as many different variants
 of the LHA file format as possible, including LArc (.lzs) and
 PMarc (.pma).
 .
 The command line tool aims to be interface-compatible with the non-free
 Unix LHA tool (command line syntax and output), for backwards
 compatibility with tools that expect particular output.
