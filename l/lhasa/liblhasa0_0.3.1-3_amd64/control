Description: lzh archive decompression library
 Lhasa is a library for parsing LHA (.lzh) archives and a free
 replacement for the Unix LHA tool.
 .
 Currently it is only possible to read from (ie. decompress) archives;
 generating (compressing) LHA archives may be an enhancement for future
 versions. The aim is to be compatible with as many different variants
 of the LHA file format as possible, including LArc (.lzs) and PMarc
 (.pma).
