Description: Very functional script for epic
 LiCe is a script designed for the ircII and EPIC irc clients; it
 radically improves the usability of these clients, providing features
 and enhancements that pioneered the way for a whole crowd of
 imitators. Though there is now much diversity, thousands of LiCe users
 still declare it the best script ever.
