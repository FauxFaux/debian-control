Description: IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client for Emacs
 Liece is based on Irchat, simple IRC client running under Emacsen,
 nevertheless nothing to do with irchat-2.4jp which has various features added
 by Japanese contributers (e.g. Mule support, channel buffers).
 We are going to full-replace to redesign thoroughly, and to stand up to
 extension against arbitrary protocol backend. The most recent version of this
 program has been almost completely rewritten from Irchat.
