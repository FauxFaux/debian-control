Description: Integration and functional testing framework
 Lift provides an integration/functional test platform which handles executable
 tests easily and generically.
 .
  * Lift only deals with executables and their return code
    - A particular test can be written in the language that fit it the most
  * Test declaration in a simple YAML syntax
    - No need to learn a programming language to integrate a test in a suite
  * Easily declare a test as running locally or on a remote machine
  * Remote tests: upload needed assets automatically and cleanup afterward
  * Naturally organize a test suite in multiple sub-folders/sub-test suites
  * Easily run a sub-test suite or specific tests from the command line
  * Pass environment variables to tests
  * Inheritance of remotes and environment across sub-test suites
    - For example, remotes can be defined in the top folder and used below
  * Only one command to run all or specific tests: lift
  * Export XUnit reports, for easy integration with Jenkins & friends
