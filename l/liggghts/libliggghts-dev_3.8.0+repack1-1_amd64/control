Description: Open Source DEM Particle Simulation Software. Development files
 LIGGGHTS stands for LAMMPS improved for general granular and granular
 heat transfer simulations.
 .
 LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics simulator. It is widely used in
 the field of Molecular Dynamics. Thanks to physical and algorithmic analogies,
 LAMMPS is a very good platform for DEM simulations. LAMMPS offers a GRANULAR
 package to perform these kind of simulations. LIGGGHTS aims to improve those
 capability with the goal to apply it to industrial applications.
 Development version.
