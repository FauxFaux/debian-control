Description: Library for lightweight image registration [development files]
 Liblimereg automatically aligns two images with similar content to each other.
 Given two 2D images the algorithm returns the rigid transformation
 parameters detected for the best possible alignment (shift, rotation). There
 are also functions for a rigid image transformation (shift, rotation) and
 for creating a difference image out of two images.
 .
 This package contains the static library and the header file.
