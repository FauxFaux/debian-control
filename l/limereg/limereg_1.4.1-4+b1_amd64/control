Description: Lightweight Image Registration
 Command line application for image registration.
 Automatically finds an optimal alignment of two input images, that makes both
 most similar to each other. Outputs the rigid transformation parameters
 (shift and rotation) and/or the registered (transformed/aligned) image.
 .
 Fast algorithm based on analytical derivative based optimization with a
 multilevel approach and without expensive sparse-matrices.
