Description: robust and user-friendly Python IRC bot
 A robust, full-featured Python IRC bot with a clean and flexible plugin API.
 Equipped with a complete ACL system for specifying user permissions with as
 much as per-command granularity. Batteries are included in the form of
 numerous plugins already written.
 .
 Limnoria is robust (it doesn't crash), user friendly (it's easy to configure)
 and programmer friendly (plugins are *extremely* easy to write).  It aims to
 be an adequate replacement for most existing IRC bots.
 .
 It is the maintained fork of supybot.
 .
 This package provides Python 3-only modules and scripts.
