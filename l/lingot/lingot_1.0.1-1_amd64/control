Description: accurate and easy to use musical instrument tuner
 Lingot is a musical instrument tuner. It's accurate, easy to use, and
 highly configurable. Originally conceived to tune electric guitars,
 it can now be used to tune any instrument.
 .
 It looks like an analogic tuner, with a gauge indicating the relative
 shift to a certain note indicating that note and its frequency.
