Description: Carnegie Mellon University's link grammar parser (all dictionaries)
 In Sleator, D. and Temperley, D. "Parsing English with a Link Grammar"
 (1991), the authors defined a new formal grammatical system called a
 "link grammar". A sequence of words is in the language of a link
 grammar if there is a way to draw "links" between words in such a way
 that the local requirements of each word are satisfied, the links do
 not cross, and the words form a connected graph. The authors encoded
 English grammar into such a system, and wrote this program to parse
 English using this grammar.
 .
 link-grammar can be used for linguistic parsing for information
 retrieval or extraction from natural language documents. It can also be
 used as a grammar checker.
 .
 This package contains all dictionaries bundled with link-grammar.
