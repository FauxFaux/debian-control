Description: program for operating PSK31/RTTY modes with X GUI
 linpsk is a program for operating on amateur radio digital modes.
 linpsk currently supports BPSK, QPSK, and RTTY modes,
 and it provides an X user interface.  linpsk's main features are:
   - simultaneous decoding of up to four channels
   - different digital modes may be mixed
   - trigger text can be defined on each channel
   - each channel can be logged to a file
   - user-defined macros and two files for larger texts
   - spectrum and waterfall displays, both scalable in the frequency domain.
 At the Moment RTTY only supports 45 baud and 1.5 stopbits.
