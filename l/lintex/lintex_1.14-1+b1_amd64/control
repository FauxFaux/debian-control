Description: automatic cleanup of old TeX-related files
 Removes unneeded files after a (La)TeX run: .aux, .log, .dvi, etc, if their
 timestamp is more recent than the TeX file's. Also removes the backup files
 created by your text editor. This keeps a directory containing multiple (La)TeX
 documents from becoming unmanageable.
