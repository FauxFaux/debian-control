Description: File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server
 This is the netkit ftp server. You are recommended to use one of its
 alternatives, such as vsftpd, proftpd, or pure-ftpd.
 .
 This server supports IPv6, and can be used in standalone mode as well
 as in inetd-slave mode, but other servers have better long-term
 security screening.
 .
 The server can be used with GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd.
