Description: firmware files used by the linux-wlan-ng driver
 linux-wlan-ng is a set of drivers and utilities that is intended to
 provide the full range of IEEE 802.11 MAC management capabilities for use
 in user-mode utilities and scripts. The package currently supports the
 Intersil 802.11b Prism2, Prism2.5, and Prism3 reference designs for
 PCMCIA, PCI, and USB. Additionally, the package includes support for the
 PLX9052 based PCI to PCMCIA adapter with a few different PCMCIA cards.
 .
 This package doesn't contain the firmware files, but a script to download
 the upstream source tree and build a deb that contains them. Note that
 only some adapters really need a firmware file and that firmware files are
 not completely free (in the sense of freely redistributable), that's why
 this package exists.
 .
 This package is only relevant for PCMCIA and PCI cards, if you have a USB
 card, install the prism2-usb-firmware-installer package instead.
