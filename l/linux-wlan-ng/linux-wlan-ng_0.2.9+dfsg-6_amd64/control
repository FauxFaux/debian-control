Description: utilities for wireless prism2 cards
 linux-wlan-ng is a set of drivers and utilities that is intended to
 provide the full range of IEEE 802.11 MAC management capabilities for use
 in user-mode utilities and scripts. The package currently supports the
 Intersil 802.11b Prism2, Prism2.5, and Prism3 reference designs for
 PCMCIA, PCI, and USB. Additionally, the package includes support for the
 PLX9052 based PCI to PCMCIA adapter with a few different PCMCIA cards.
 .
 Please note that you probably do not need this package: The prism2_usb
 driver is included in the default kernel packages since 2.6.31.
 If you need firmware loading for your prism2_usb device, please just
 install the prism2-usb-firmware-installer package.
 .
 This package ships legacy utilities and scripts for advanced
 configuration and user-space firmware downloading (support for
 non-USB devices).
