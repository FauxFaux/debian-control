Description: Support daemons for Linux running on Hyper-V
 Suite of daemons for Linux guests running on Hyper-V, consisting of
 hv_fcopy_daemon, hv_kvp_daemon and hv_vss_daemon.
 .
 hv_fcopy_daemon provides the file copy service, allowing the host to copy
 files into the guest.
 .
 hv_kvp_daemon provides the key-value pair (KVP) service, allowing the host
 to get and set the IP networking configuration of the guest.  (This
 requires helper scripts which are not currently included.)
 .
 hv_vss_daemon provides the volume shadow copy service (VSS), allowing the
 host to freeze the guest filesystems while taking a snapshot.
