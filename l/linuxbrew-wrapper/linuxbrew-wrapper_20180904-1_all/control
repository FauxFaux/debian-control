Description: Homebrew package manager for Linux
 Linuxbrew is a fork of Homebrew, the Mac OS package manager, for Linux.
 .
 It can be installed in your home directory and does not require root
 access. The same package manager can be used on both your Linux server
 and your Mac laptop. Installing a modern version of glibc and gcc in
 your home directory on an old distribution of Linux takes five minutes.
 .
 Features:
  * Can install software to a home directory and so does not require sudo
  * Install software not packaged by the native distribution
  * Install up-to-date versions of software when the native distribution is old
  * Use the same package manager to manage both your Mac and Linux machines
 .
 This package provides Linuxbrew install scripts instead of linuxbrew itself.
