Description: Precision Time Protocol (PTP, IEEE1588) implementation for Linux
 Linuxptp is an implementation of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
 according to IEEE standard 1588 for Linux. Features include:
  - support for hardware and software time stamping via the Linux
    SO_TIMESTAMPING socket option.
  - support for the Linux PTP Hardware Clock (PHC) subsystem by using the
    clock_gettime family of calls, including the new clock_adjtimex
    system call
  - implementation of Boundary Clock (BC) and Ordinary Clock (OC)
  - transport over UDP/IPv4, UDP/IPv6, and raw Ethernet (Layer 2)
  - support for IEEE 802.1AS-2011 in the role of end station
 .
 PTP provides higher precision and faster synchronization than NTP even
 without hardware support. With hardware support, sub-microsecond
 accuracy can be expected. Whereas NTP is intended for WAN use, PTP is
 designed for LAN environments and makes use of UDP multicast.
