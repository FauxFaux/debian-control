Description: signal processing library for software defined radio
 liquid-dsp is a free and open-source digital signal processing (DSP)
 library designed specifically for software defined radios on embedded
 platforms. The aim is to provide a lightweight DSP library that does not
 rely on a myriad of external dependencies or proprietary and otherwise
 cumbersome frameworks. All signal processing elements are designed to be
 flexible, scalable, and dynamic, including filters, filter design,
 oscillators, modems, synchronizers, and complex mathematical operations.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
