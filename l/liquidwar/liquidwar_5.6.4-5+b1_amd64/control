Description: truly original multiplayer wargame
 Liquid War is an original multiplayer wargame. There are no weapons, the only
 thing you have to do is to move a cursor in a 2-D battlefield. This cursor is
 followed by your army, which is composed by a  great many little fighters,
 represented by small colored squares. When fighters from different teams meet,
 they eat each other, it is as simple as that.
 .
 A single player mode is available, but the game is definitely designed to be
 multiplayer, and has network support.
