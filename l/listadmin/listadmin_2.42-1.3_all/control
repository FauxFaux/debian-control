Description: command line mailman moderator queue manipulation
 listadmin is a command line tool to manipulate the queues of messages
 held for moderator approval by mailman.  It is designed to keep user
 interaction to a minimum, in theory you could run it from cron to
 prune the queue. It can use the score from a header added by
 SpamAssassin to filter, or it can match specific senders, subjects, or
 reasons.
