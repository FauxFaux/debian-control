Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Litecoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that
 is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or
 trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and
 transact directly with each other, with the help of a P2P network to
 check for double-spending. Litecoin is a fork of Bitcoin.
 .
 By default connects to an IRC network to discover other peers.
 .
 Full transaction history is stored locally at each client.
 This requires 5+ GB of space, slowly growing.
 .
 This package provides the daemon (litecoind), and the CLI tool to
 interact with the daemon.
