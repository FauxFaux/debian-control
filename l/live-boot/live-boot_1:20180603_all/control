Description: Live System Boot Components
 The Live Systems project maintains the components to build Debian based Live
 systems and the official Debian Live images themselves.
 .
 live-boot contains the components to configure a live system during the boot
 process (early userspace). Do not install this package on your regular system,
 it is only meant to be used in a live image.
 .
 In addition to live-boot, a backend for the initrd generation is required, such
 as live-boot-initramfs-tools.
