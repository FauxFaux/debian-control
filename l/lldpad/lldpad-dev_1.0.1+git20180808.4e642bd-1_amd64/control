Description: Link Layer Discovery Protocol Implementation (Development headers)
 The lldpad package is an implementation of the Link Layer Discovery
 Protocol (LLDP).  It originated from Intel's Data Center Bridging (DCB)
 software - the dcbd package.  The lldpad package adds LLDP support
 for all ports in addition to DCB Exchange protocol (DCBX) support on DCB
 capable ports (as was provided by dcbd).  Also, support for additional
 LLDP TLVs has been added.
 .
 DCB is a collection of emerging standards-based technologies designed to
 allow Ethernet to support multiple types of traffic classes in the Data
 Center.  The DCBX functionality of this package is designed to work with
 the DCB kernel interface (dcbnl in rtnetlink) that is included in the Linux
 kernel 2.6.29 or higher.  The Intel ixgbe driver supports the dcbnl interface.
 .
 This package contains lldpad development headers.
