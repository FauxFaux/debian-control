Description: command line document converter using LibreOfficeKit
 A command line document format converter which uses LibreOffice (via
 its LibreOfficeKit API) to do all the hard work.  It should support
 the same formats which LibreOffice does.
 .
 LibreOfficeKit was formerly known as liblibreoffice, hence the name
 "lloconv".
