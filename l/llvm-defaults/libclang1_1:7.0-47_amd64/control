Description: C, C++ and Objective-C compiler (LLVM based)
 Clang project is a C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-end
 for the LLVM compiler. Its goal is to offer a replacement to the GNU Compiler
 Collection (GCC).
 .
 Clang implements all of the ISO C++ 1998, 11 and 14 standards and also
 provides most of the support of C++17.
 .
 This is a dependency package providing the default clang libraries.
 .
 The C Interface to Clang provides a relatively small API that exposes
 facilities for parsing source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST),
 loading already-parsed ASTs, traversing the AST, associating physical source
 locations with elements within the AST, and other facilities that support
 Clang-based development tools.
