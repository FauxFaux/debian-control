Description: clang library
 Clang project is a C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-end

 Clang fully implements all published ISO C++ standards including C++11, as
 well as the upcoming C++14 standard, and some parts of the fledgling C++1z
 standard, and is considered a production-quality C++ compiler.
