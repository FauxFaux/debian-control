Description: clang library - Common development package
 Clang project is a C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-end
 for the LLVM compiler. Its goal is to offer a replacement to the GNU Compiler
 Collection (GCC).
 .
 Clang fully implements all published ISO C++ standards including C++11, as
 well as the upcoming C++14 standard, and some parts of the fledgling C++1z
 standard, and is considered a production-quality C++ compiler.
 .
 This package contains the clang generic headers and some libraries
 (profiling, etc).
