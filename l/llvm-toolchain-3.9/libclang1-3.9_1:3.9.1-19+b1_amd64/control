Description: C interface to the clang library
 Clang project is a C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-end
 for the LLVM compiler. Its goal is to offer a replacement to the GNU Compiler
 Collection (GCC).
 .
 Clang fully implements all published ISO C++ standards including C++11, as
 well as the upcoming C++14 standard, and some parts of the fledgling C++1z
 standard, and is considered a production-quality C++ compiler.
 .
 This package contains the clang library.
 .
 The C Interface to Clang provides a relatively small API that exposes
 facilities for parsing source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST),
 loading already-parsed ASTs, traversing the AST, associating physical source
 locations with elements within the AST, and other facilities that support
 Clang-based development tools.
