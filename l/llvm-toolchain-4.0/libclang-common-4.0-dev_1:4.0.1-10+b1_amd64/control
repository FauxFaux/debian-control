Description: clang library - Common development package
 Clang project is a C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-end

 GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).
 .
 Clang implements all of the ISO C++ 1998, 11 and 14 standards and also
 provides most of the support of C++17.
 .
 This package contains the clang generic headers and some libraries
 (profiling, etc).
