Description: clang library - Development package
 Clang project is a C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-end

 Clang implements all of the ISO C++ 1998, 11 and 14 standards and also
 provides most of the support of C++17.
 .
 This package contains the clang headers to develop extensions over
 libclang1-5.0.
