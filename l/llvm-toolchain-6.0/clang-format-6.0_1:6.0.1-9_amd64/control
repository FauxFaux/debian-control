Description: Tool to format C/C++/Obj-C code
 Clang-format is both a library and a stand-alone tool with the goal of
 automatically reformatting C++ sources files according to configurable
 style guides. To do so, clang-format uses Clang's Lexer to transform an
 input file into a token stream and then changes all the whitespace around
 those tokens. The goal is for clang-format to both serve both as a user
 tool (ideally with powerful IDE integrations) and part of other
 refactoring tools, e.g. to do a reformatting of all the lines changed
 during a renaming.
 .
 This package also provides vim and emacs plugins.
