Description: C interface to the clang library
 Clang project is a C, C++, Objective C and Objective C++ front-end
 based on the LLVM compiler. Its goal is to offer a replacement to the
 GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).
 .
 Clang implements all of the ISO C++ 1998, 11 and 14 standards and also
 provides most of the support of C++17.
 .
 This package contains the clang library.
 .
 The C Interface to Clang provides a relatively small API that exposes
 facilities for parsing source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST),
 loading already-parsed ASTs, traversing the AST, associating physical source
 locations with elements within the AST, and other facilities that support
 Clang-based development tools.
