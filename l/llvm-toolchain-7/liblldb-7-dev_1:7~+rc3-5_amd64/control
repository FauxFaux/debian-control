Description: Next generation, high-performance debugger, header files
 LLDB is a next generation, high-performance debugger. It is built as a set of
 reusable components which highly leverage existing libraries in the larger LLVM
 Project, such as the Clang expression parser and LLVM disassembler.
 .
 This package provides the header files to build extension over lldb.
