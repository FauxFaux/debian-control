Description: Lightning Memory-Mapped Database Utilities
 This package provides tools for manipulating LMDB databases:
  * mdb_stat - LMDB environment status tool
  * mdb_copy - LMDB environment copy tool
 .
 Lighting Memory-Mapped Database (LMDB) is an ultra-fast, ultra-compact
 key-value embedded data store developed for the OpenLDAP Project.  It uses
 memory-mapped files, so it has the read performance of a pure in-memory
 database while still offering the persistence of standard disk-based
 databases, and is only limited to the size of the virtual address space, (it
 is not limited to the size of physical RAM).
