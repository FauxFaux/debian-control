Description: OpenType fonts based on Computer Modern
 The Latin Modern fonts, also known as "lm fonts", are a set of
 scalable fonts in PostScript Type 1 and OpenType formats. They are
 based on the PostScript Type 1 version of the Computer Modern fonts
 and contain many additional characters (mostly accented ones).
 .
 This package provides the OpenType variant of these fonts. For support
 for TeX and Type 1 (PostScript) fonts, see the lmodern package.
 .
 The Latin Modern fonts were generated using MetaType1, a program
 based on MetaPost for generating PostScript Type 1 fonts
 (ftp://bop.eps.gda.pl/pub/metatype1/). Their size is reasonable and
 they are usually considered to be of good quality (compared to
 cm-super, for instance; however, cm-super contains font families
 that have no equivalent in this package; additionally, there are
 character sets that are supported by cm-super and not by the Latin
 Modern fonts).
