Description: scalable PostScript and OpenType fonts based on Computer Modern

 scalable fonts in PostScript Type 1 and OpenType formats. They are
 based on the PostScript Type 1 version of the Computer Modern fonts
 and contain many additional characters (mostly accented ones).

 This package provides TeX support and Type1 (PostScript) fonts. If only
 the OpenType fonts are needed, please see the package fonts-lmodern.
