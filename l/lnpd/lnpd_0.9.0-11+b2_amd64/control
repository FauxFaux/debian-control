Description: daemon for LNP communication with BrickOS
 The lnpd package provides a daemon capable of being started at boot time
 that enables communication with a LEGO(r) Mindstorms RCX which is running
 BrickOS. This package also provides a library so that you can build
 client programs which talk via LNP to applications running under brickOS
 on the RCX.  See the examples provided.
