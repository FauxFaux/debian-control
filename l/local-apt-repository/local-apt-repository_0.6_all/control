Description: Ready to use local apt repository
 With this package installed, every Debian package (i.e. a *.deb file) dropped
 into /srv/local-apt-repository (which you need to create first) will be
 available to apt.
 .
 This package does not provide an apt repository to be used by other hosts. For
 that, look at more serious repository solutions like reprepro and
 apt-ftparchive.
