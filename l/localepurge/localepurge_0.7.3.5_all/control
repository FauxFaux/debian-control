Description: reclaim disk space by removing unneeded localizations
 This package provides a script to recover disk space wasted for unneeded
 locales, GNOME/KDE localizations and localized man pages. Depending on
 the installation, it is possible to save hundreds of megabytes of disk
 space taken up by localization you will most probably never have any
 use for. It is run automatically upon completion of any APT installation
 actions.
 .
 This tool is a hack which is *not* integrated with the system's
 package management system and therefore is not for the faint of heart.
 Its interference can provoke strange, but usually harmless, behavior in
 programs related to apt/dpkg, such as dpkg-repack, reportbug, etc.
 Responsibility for its usage and possible breakage of the system
 therefore lies in the system administrator's hands.
 .
 Please do abstain from reporting any such bugs blaming localepurge if you
 break the system by using it. If you don't know what you are doing and
 can't handle any resulting breakage, you should not install this package.
