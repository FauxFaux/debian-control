Description: log4j-style configurable logging library for C++ (API docs)
 log4shib provides a library of C++ classes for flexible
 logging to files, syslog, and other destinations.  It is modeled after the
 log4j Java library, staying as close to that API as is reasonable.
 .
 log4shib is a fork of the log4cpp library with additional fixes and
 modifications to improve its thread safety and robustness.  It is
 primarily intended for use by the Shibboleth web authentication
 system.
 .
 This package contains the log4shib library API documentation generated
 by Doxygen.
