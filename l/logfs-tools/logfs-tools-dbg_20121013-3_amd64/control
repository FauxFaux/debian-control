Description: Tools to manage logfs filesystems (debug)
 LogFS is a scalable flash filesystem. It is aimed to replace JFFS2 for most
 uses, but focuses more on large devices. JFFS2 works well enough on small
 devices, it just gets slow and uses up too much memory on larger ones.
 .
 This package contains the debugging symbols for the utilities needed to
 create logfs filesystems.
