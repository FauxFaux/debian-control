Description: Logging service for distributed applications
 Monitoring distributed applications that are spread over a network is not an
 easy task.  Information from several sources must be gathered,  filtered and
 distributed to visualisation tools.
 .
 LogService is a system that simplifies this task.
 It acts as a common base between an application and it's visualisation tools.
 It also provides a mechanism to classify and filter messages in a general
 way and other functions are needed to monitor distributed applications.
 .
 The service is named LogCentral.
