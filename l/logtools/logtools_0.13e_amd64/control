Description: Russell's misc tools for managing log files.
 clfmerge - merge common-log-format web logs in order without sorting (good for
 when you have a gig of logs).
 .
 logprn - like "tail -f" but after a specified time period of inactivity will
 run a program (such as lpr) and pipe the new data to it)
 .
 funnel - pipe one stream of data to several files or processes.
 .
 clfsplit - split CLF format web logs by client IP address.
 .
 clfdomainsplit - split CLF logs by server domain.
