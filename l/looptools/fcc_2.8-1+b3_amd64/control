Description: Script to compile C/C++ programs and link to Fortran libraries
 LoopTools is a package for evaluation of scalar and tensor one-loop
 integrals based on the FF package by G.J. van Oldenborgh. It features
 an easy Fortran, C++, and Mathematica interface to the scalar
 one-loop functions of FF and in addition provides the 2-, 3-, and
 4-point tensor coefficient functions.
 .
 This package provides a script, fcc, to compile C and C++ programs
 and link them with Fortran libraries.
