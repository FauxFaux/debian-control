Description: development files for the LORENE framework for numerical relativity
 LORENE is a set of C++ classes to solve various problems arising in
 numerical relativity, and more generally in computational
 astrophysics. It provides tools to solve partial differential
 equations by means of multi-domain spectral methods.
 .
 This package contains the static libraries and include files
 necessary to build LORENE codes or applications using LORENE.
 .
 Compiling LORENE codes (including some that are shipped in the
 lorene-codes-src package) often requires a Fortran compiler. LORENE
 is configured to use gfortran.
