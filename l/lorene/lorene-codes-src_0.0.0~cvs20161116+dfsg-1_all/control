Description: source files of LORENE-based codes
 LORENE is a set of C++ classes to solve various problems arising in
 numerical relativity, and more generally in computational
 astrophysics. It provides tools to solve partial differential
 equations by means of multi-domain spectral methods.
 .
 This package contains the source files of several LORENE codes that
 need to be recompiled for each use case. The liblorene-dev package is
 necessary to compile those codes.
