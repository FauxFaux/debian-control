Description: framework for numerical relativity
 LORENE is a set of C++ classes to solve various problems arising in
 numerical relativity, and more generally in computational
 astrophysics. It provides tools to solve partial differential
 equations by means of multi-domain spectral methods.
 .
 This metapackage depends on all of the LORENE software
 components. The reference guide is available in the lorene-doc
 package.
