Description: simple and automated Usenet downloader for Newzbin (NZB) files
 LottaNZB aims to simplify and automate the download of files from the Usenet.
 You can tell LottaNZB what to download using NZB files, which are created
 by many Usenet search engines. LottaNZB integrates nicely with GNOME desktops,
 but is not limited to them and uses the mature SABnzbd software as its
 foundation.
