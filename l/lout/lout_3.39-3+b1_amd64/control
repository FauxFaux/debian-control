Description: Typesetting system, an alternative to (La)TeX
 Lout is a document formatting system similar in style to LaTeX, i.e.
 it works with mark-up files - plain text files containing commands to
 control the formatting.
 .
 Lout offers a very full range of features, including
  * PostScript, PDF, and plain text output
  * optimal paragraph and page breaking
  * automatic hyphenation
  * PostScript EPS file inclusion and generation
  * equation formatting, tables, diagrams
  * rotation and scaling
  * sorted indexes, bibliographic databases
  * running headers and odd-even pages, automatic cross referencing
  * multilingual documents including hyphenation (most European languages are
    supported, including Russian),
  * formatting of C/C++ programs.
 .
 Lout may be extended by writing definitions which are much simpler than
 the equivalent troff or TeX macros.
 .
 Lout has several advantages over (La)TeX.  It is much smaller, and it is
 much easier to understand how to do things in Lout (including writing
 definitions) than in TeX or LaTeX.  Lout's PostScript output is very small
 and clean.
 .
 However, it is much less widely used than (La)TeX, so there are
 fewer add-on definition packages for Lout than for (La)TeX and fewer
 local experts around to ask about problems.  You are unlikely to
 find many Lout documents floating around the 'net.
