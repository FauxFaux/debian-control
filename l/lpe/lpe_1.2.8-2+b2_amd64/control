Description: Lightweight Programmer's Editor
 lpe stands for "lightweight programmer's editor", and is exactly that.
 It is designed to provide at the same time all the features that might
 be required in a decent code editor and a light, intuitive feel that
 makes it a pleasure to work with, making all necessary commands
 accessible as easily as possible.
