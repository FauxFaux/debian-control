Description: library for calculating Littlewood-Richardson coefficients - development files
 The "Littlewood-Richardson Calculator" is a package of C programs for
 computing Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, providing fast calculation of
 single LR coefficients, products of Schur functions, and skew Schur functions.
 Its interface uses the same notation as the SF package of John Stembridge, to
 make it easier to use both packages at the same time.
 .
 This package contains the development files for the library.
