Description: The Lovely Sister Database (email rolodex) for Emacs
 LSDB (The Lovely Sister Database) is a rolodex-like database program
 for SEMI based MUA.  It's intended to be a lightweight relacement for
 BBDB (The Insidious Big Brother Database).  Unfortunately, it
 currently doesn't support the all features of BBDB.
