 as lsh-keygen, lsh-writekey (both programs for public/private key
 generation), lsh-authorize (for automatic remote key authentication),
 ssh-conv (utilities for converting between various public and private
 key formats), and a number of other utilities for use with both the
 lsh server and client.

 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
