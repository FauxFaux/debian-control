Description: Fuse based remote filesystem hooks for LTSP thin clients
 LtspFS is a remote filesystem consisting of two parts:
 1) A network server daemon that runs on the LTSP terminal.
 2) A FUSE module that runs in userspace on the server, that connects with
 the daemon on the client.
 .
 This package contains hooks to automount devices in LTSP sessions,
 specifically logins using LDM.
