Description: Lua-5.3-style APIs for Lua 5.2 and 5.1
 This is a small module that aims to make it easier to write code in a
 Lua-5.3-style that is compatible with Lua 5.1, Lua 5.2, and Lua
 5.3. This does not make Lua 5.2 (or even Lua 5.1) entirely compatible
 with Lua 5.3, but it brings the API closer to that of Lua 5.3.
Lua-Versions: 5.2 5.1
