Description: Lua state creation and control library for the Lua language
 Rings is a library which provides a way to create new Lua states from within
 Lua. It also offers a simple way to communicate between the creator (master)
 and the created (slave) states.
 .
 This mechanism can be used to run chunks of code in an isolated
 Lua state, obtaining what is usually called a sandbox.
