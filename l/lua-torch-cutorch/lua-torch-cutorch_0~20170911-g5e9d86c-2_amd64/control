Description: CUDA backend for Torch framework
 Cutorch provides a CUDA backend for torch7. It provides the following:
 .
  - a new tensor type: `torch.CudaTensor` that acts like `torch.FloatTensor`,
    but all it's operations are on the GPU. Most of the tensor operations are
    supported by cutorch. There are a few missing ones, which are being
    implemented. The missing list can be found here:
      https://github.com/torch/cutorch/issues/70
  - several other GPU tensor types, with limited functionality. Currently
    limited to copying/conversion, and several indexing and shaping operations.
  - `cutorch.*` - Functions to set/get GPU, get device properties, memory
    usage, set/get low-level streams, set/get random number generator's seed,
    synchronization etc. They are described in more detail below.
 .
 This package ships the Lua interface of Cutorch.
