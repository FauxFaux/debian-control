Description: Neural Network Graph Package for Torch Framework
 This package provides graphical computation for `nn` library in Torch.
 The aim of this library is to provide users of `nn` package with tools to
 easily create complicated architectures. Any given `nn` `module` is going
 to be bundled into a graph node. The `__call__` operator of an instance of
 `nn.Module` is used to create architectures as if one is writing function
 calls.
Lua-Versions: 5.1
