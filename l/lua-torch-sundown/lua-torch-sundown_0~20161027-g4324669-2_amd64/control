Description: Sundown Library (a Markdown implementation) for Torch Framework
 This is a LuaJIT interface to the Sundown library (a Markdown implementation).

 To render into HTML, the easiest is to use the provided `renderHTML()`
 function (aliased to `render()`), which interfaces Sundown renderer with
 Houdini HTML default renderer.
 .
 This package also provides an extra renderer `renderASCII()` which outputs
 pretty colored ASCII for Markdown pages.
