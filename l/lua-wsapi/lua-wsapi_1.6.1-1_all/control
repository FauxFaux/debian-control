Description: Web server API abstraction layer for the Lua language
 WSAPI is an API that abstracts the web server for Lua web applications,
 allowing the same application to be used in different web servers.
 .
 This package contains the WSAPI utility libraries (for common tasks like url
 encoding/decoding) as well as the following backends (server implementations):
 .
  - CGI (the regular environment-variables based protocol)
  - xavante (for the Xavante web server)
 .
 The fastcgi backends is available in the separate package lua-wsapi-fcgi.
