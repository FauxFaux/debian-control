Description: Lua 5.1 Debian policy - template and scripts
 This package contains some template/support files (like a generic Makefile, a
 generic test application...) that can be used by Lua libraries at compile
 time. It also includes a simple script that sets up an svn directory
 conforming to svn-buildpackage and populates it with the standard files needed
 to use lua5.1-policy-dev at build time. Obviously packages made using
 lua5.1-policy-dev will conform to the policy contained in lua5.1-policy.
