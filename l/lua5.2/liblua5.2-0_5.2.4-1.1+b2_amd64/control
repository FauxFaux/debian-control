Description: Shared library for the Lua interpreter version 5.2
 Lua is a powerful, light-weight programming language designed for extending
 applications.  The language engine is accessible as a library, having a C
 API which allows the application to exchange data with Lua programs and also
 to extend Lua with C functions.  Lua is also used as a general-purpose,
 stand-alone language through the simple command line interpreter provided.
 .
 This package contains runtime libraries.  You shouldn't need to install it
 explicitly.
