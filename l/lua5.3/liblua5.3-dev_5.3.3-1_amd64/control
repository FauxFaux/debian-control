Description: Development files for the Lua language version 5.3
 Lua is a powerful, light-weight programming language designed for extending
 applications.  The language engine is accessible as a library, having a C
 API which allows the application to exchange data with Lua programs and also
 to extend Lua with C functions.  Lua is also used as a general-purpose,
 stand-alone language through the simple command line interpreter provided.

 Install it if you are developing programs which use the Lua C API.
