Description: Small embeddable language with simple procedural syntax
 Lua is a programming language originally designed for extending
 applications, but also frequently used as a general-purpose,
 stand-alone language.
 .
 Lua combines simple procedural syntax (similar to Pascal) with
 powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and
 extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, interpreted from
 bytecodes, and has automatic memory management, making it ideal for
 configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping. Lua is implemented
 as a small library of C functions, written in ANSI C, and the
 implementation goals are simplicity, efficiency, portability, and low
 embedding cost.
