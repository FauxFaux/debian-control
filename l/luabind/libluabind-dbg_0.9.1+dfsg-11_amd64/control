Description: luabind c++ binding for lua: unstripped binaries
 Luabind is a library that helps you create bindings between C++ and Lua.
 It has the ability to expose functions and classes, written in C++, to
 Lua. It will also supply the functionality to define classes in lua and
 let them derive from other lua classes or C++ classes. Lua classes can
 override virtual functions from their C++ baseclasses. It is written
 towards Lua 5.0, and does not work with Lua other Lua versions.
 .
 This package contains the luabind unstripped binaries, for debugging
 applications developed with luabind.
