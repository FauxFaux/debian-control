Description: Just in time compiler for Lua - library version
 LuaJIT implements the full set of language features defined by Lua 5.1. The
 virtual machine (VM) is API- and ABI-compatible to the standard Lua interpreter
 and can be deployed as a drop-in replacement.
 .
 This package contains an embeddable version of LuaJIT that can be used as a
 replacement of the standard liblua-5.1 shared library.
