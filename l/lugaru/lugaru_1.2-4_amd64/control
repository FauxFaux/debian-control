Description: third person ninja rabbit fighting game
 Lugaru (pronounced Loo-GAH-roo) is a cross-platform third-person action game.
 The main character, Turner, is an anthropomorphic rebel bunny rabbit with
 impressive combat skills. In his quest to find those responsible for
 slaughtering his village, he uncovers a far-reaching conspiracy involving the
 corrupt leaders of the rabbit republic and the starving wolves from a nearby
 den. Turner takes it upon himself to fight against their plot and save his
 fellow rabbits from slavery.
 .
 Lugaru HD is developed by the OSS Lugaru project and is based on the original
 Lugaru HD by Wolfire Games.
