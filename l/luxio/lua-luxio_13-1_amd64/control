Description: Posix bindings for Lua
 Lightweight UNIX I/O and POSIX binding for Lua
 .
  * Reasonably good coverage of POSIX and BSD Sockets, including IPv6,
    and some GNU extensions.
  * Low-level.  You get the return values and the errno for the bound
    functions where possible.  Others take a table to fill in, or
    may return tables.
  * High-level wrapper library providing nice IO access and to misc.
    utility functions.  Generates useful errors in assert()able form,
    and provides meaningful __tostring metamethods to aid debugging.
  * A high-level poll()-based event dispatch library.
  * Sub-process handling library (read/write io.popen with job control).
  * A prototype POSIX Message Queue-based IPC scheme that can serialise
    most simple Lua values.  (No closures, userdata, etc)
