Description: library and tools for LV2 plugins
 These are some tools and libraries that may come in handy
 when writing LV2 plugins in C++.
 .
 The following static libraries are provided:
  * liblv2-plugin is a C++ library that you can use to write LV2
    plugins by inheriting from a plugin base class and overriding
    a small number of functions.
  * liblv2-gui is a C++ library that you can use to write LV2
    plugin GUIs.
 .
 This package also contains the binaries lv2peg and lv2soname:
  * lv2peg is a program that generates C header files from
    Turtle files containing LV2 plugin data.
  * lv2soname is a program that generate the RDF triples needed
    to tell hosts that the library with that soname must never be
    unloaded even after your plugin GUI library has been unloaded.
 .
 This package provides runtime objects and development files.
