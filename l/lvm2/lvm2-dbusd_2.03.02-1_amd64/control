Description: LVM2 D-Bus daemon
 This is LVM2, the rewrite of The Linux Logical Volume Manager.  LVM
 supports enterprise level volume management of disk and disk subsystems
 by grouping arbitrary disks into volume groups. The total capacity of
 volume groups can be allocated to logical volumes, which are accessed as
 regular block devices.
 .
 This package includes the D-Bus daemon.
