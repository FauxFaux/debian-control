Description: small implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite - documentation
 lwIP is a small independent implementation of the TCP/IPv4/IPv6 protocol
 suite that has been developed by Adam Dunkels at the Computer and
 Networks Architectures (CNA) lab at the Swedish Institute of Computer
 Science (SICS).
 .
 The focus of the lwIP TCP/IP implementation is to reduce the RAM usage
 while still having a full scale TCP. This making lwIP suitable for use
 in embedded systems with tens of kilobytes of free RAM and room for
 around 40 kilobytes of code ROM.
 .
 This package contains the documentation.
