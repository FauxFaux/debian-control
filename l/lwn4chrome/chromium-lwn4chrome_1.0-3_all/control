Description: Chromium extension for making LWN.net slightly easier to read
 When faced with an LWN article that links to another LWN article, with
 perhaps a word of anchor text, it's hard to tell if the new article is worth
 opening in a tab, is indeed already open in a tab, or has been previously
 read.
 .
 This package adds a adds title attributes to LWN links, which helps to solve
 this problem.
