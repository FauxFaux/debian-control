Description: cooperative GLib bindings for OCaml
 Lwt is a library for cooperative threads implemented in a monadic style.
 Unlike preemptive threads, cooperative threads do not use a scheduler to
 distribute processor time between threads. Instead, each thread must
 announce that it wants to let the others run.
 .
 This package contains all the development stuff you need to use Lwt
 with cooperative GLib in your programs.
