Description: cooperative light-weight thread library (documentation)
 Lwt is a library for cooperative threads implemented in a monadic style.
 Unlike preemptive threads, cooperative threads do not use a scheduler to
 distribute processor time between threads. Instead, each thread must
 announce that it wants to let the others run.
 .
 This package contains the complete API reference for Lwt, including
 OpenSSL, GLib bindings, and examples.
