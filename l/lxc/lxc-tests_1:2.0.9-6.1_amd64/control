Description: Linux Containers userspace tools (test binaries)
 Containers are insulated areas inside a system, which have their own namespace
 for filesystem, network, PID, IPC, CPU and memory allocation and which can be
 created using the Control Group and Namespace features included in the Linux
 kernel.
 .
 This package contains the test binaries. Those binaries are primarily
 used for autopkgtest and by some developers. They are not meant to be
 installed on regular user systems.
