Description: PAM module for managing cgroups for LXC
 LXCFS provides a FUSE based filesystem to improve the LXC experience
 within the containers.
 .
 This provides a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) to provide
 logged-in users with a set of cgroups which they can administer.
 This allows for instance unprivileged containers, and session
 management using cgroup process tracking.
