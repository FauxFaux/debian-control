Description: Server for the LysKOM conference system
 LysKOM has a lot in common with netnews, but LysKOM is
 intended for local discussions (instead of worldwide).
 LysKOM consists of a server process and several client
 programs. The server process maintains a data base of
 persons, conferences and articles. The clients connect to
 the server and let the users browse the database for
 unread articles.
 .
 LysKOM is much faster than netnews - almost as fast as irc
 or ICQ! - but like in netnews the articles are saved so
 that you don't have to be logged in to receive the news.
