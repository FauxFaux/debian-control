Description: Tools for working with LZ4 compression algorithm.
 LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed > 500 MB/s
 per core, scalable with multi-cores CPU. It features an extremely fast
 decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core, typically reaching RAM speed
 limits on multi-core systems.
 .
 Speed can be tuned dynamically, selecting an "acceleration" factor which
 trades compression ratio for faster speed. On the other end, a high
 compression derivative, LZ4_HC, is also provided, trading CPU time for
 improved compression ratio. All versions feature the same decompression speed.
 .
 LZ4 is also compatible with dictionary compression, and can ingest any input
 file as dictionary, including those created by Zstandard Dictionary Builder.
