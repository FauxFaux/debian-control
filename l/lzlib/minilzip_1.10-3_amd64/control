Description: minified, lossless data compressor based on the LZMA algorithm
 Lzip is a lossless data compressor based on the LZMA algorithm, with very safe
 integrity checking and a user interface similar to the one of gzip or bzip2.
 Lzip decompresses almost as fast as gzip and compresses better than bzip2,
 which makes it well suited for software distribution and data archiving.
 .
 Minilzip is a minimal version of lzip using the lzip file format; the files
 produced by Minilzip are fully compatible with lzip.
 .
 Minilzip is intended as a test program for the lzlib library.
