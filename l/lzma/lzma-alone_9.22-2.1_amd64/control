Description: Compression and decompression in the LZMA format - legacy utility
 The Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain Algorithm is a compression method based on
 the famous LZ77 algorithm, and was first introduced by 7-Zip for use in
 7z archives.
 .
 Its main characteristics are a very high compression ratio, with high RAM
 usage, and fast decompression, with low RAM usage. These properties make
 it well suited to embedded uses, such as for ROM (firmware) compression.
 .
 This package provides only the old lzma_alone compression utility, which
 has an interface more like that of zip.
