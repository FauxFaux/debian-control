Description: Perl module to create accessor methods in caller's package
 The accessors pragma lets you create simple accessors at compile-time.
 .
 This saves you from writing them by hand, which tends to result in
 cut-n-paste errors and a mess of duplicated code. It can also help you reduce
 the ammount of unwanted direct-variable access that may creep into your
 codebase when you're feeling lazy. accessors was designed with laziness in
 mind.
 .
 Method-chaining accessors are generated by default. Note that you can still
 use accessors::chained directly for reasons of backwards compatibility.
 .
 See accessors::classic for accessors that always return the current value if
 you don't like method chaining.
