Description: Perl module for really clean programs
 The first time you run a program under use Acme::Bleach, the module removes all
 the unsightly printable characters from your source file.

 This package also installs the Acme::DWIM and Acme::Morse modules. Acme::DWIM
 replaces all the unsightly operators et al. from your source file with the new
 DWIM operator: ... (pronounced "yadda yadda yadda"). Acme::Morse converts your
 program to Morse code.
