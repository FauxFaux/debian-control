Description: module that makes inconstant constants, except actually not
 Acme::constant lets you make inconstant constants, just like the constants the
 users of Ruby or Opera (before Opera 14, that is) already enjoyed.
 .
 Unlike Perl constants, that are replaced at compile time, Acme constants, in
 true dynamic programming language style, can be modified even after
 declaration.
 .
 Just like constants generated with standard use constant pragma, the
 constants declared with use Acme::Constant don't have any sigils. This makes
 using constants easier, as you don't have to remember what sigil do constants
 use.
