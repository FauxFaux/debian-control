Description: Time sliced pony race using the POE event loop
 POE::Knee is a homophone of "Pony".  We all like ponies. And wouldn't we
 love to race ponies? Well, that's what Acme::POE::Knee is for!
 .
 Using the POE event driven component architecture, you specify a distance the
 ponies must run, and a maximum delay before the pony will reach the next
 step. So, the bigger the delay, the bigger the distance between multiple
 ponies can be.
