Description: Java based library supporting AJAX in Java Server Pages
 The AJAX Tag Library is a set of JSP tags that simplify the use of
 Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) technology in JavaServer Pages.
 .
 This tag library does not force J2EE developers to write the necessary
 JavaScript to implement an AJAX-capable web form. The tag library provides
 support for live form updates for the following use cases:
  - autocomplete based on character input to an input field
  - select box population based on selections made from another field
  - callout or balloon popups for highlighting content
  - refreshing form fields
  - toggling images and form field states on/off.
