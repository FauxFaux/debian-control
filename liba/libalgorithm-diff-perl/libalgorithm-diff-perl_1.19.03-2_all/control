Description: module to find differences between files
 Algorithm::Diff is a Perl module that allows users to analyze text based on a
 Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm. It can compare two files and find
 the differences between them, which can produce the same information as the
 common Unix tool 'diff'.
 .
 There is an XS-optimized implementation of the core loop, which accelerates
 some types of diff output (see libalgorithm-diff-xs-perl).
