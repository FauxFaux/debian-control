Description: Perl interface to an L-BFGS non-linear optimization algorithm
 Algorithm::LBFGS is an interface to liblbfgs, a C implementation of L-BFGS.
 .
 L-BFGS (Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) is a quasi-Newton
 method for unconstrained optimization. This method is especially efficient on
 problems involving a large number of variables.
 .
 Generally, it solves a problem described as following:
 .
 min f(x), x = (x1, x2, ..., xn)
