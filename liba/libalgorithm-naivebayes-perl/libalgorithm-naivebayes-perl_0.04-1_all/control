Description: module to make bayesian prediction of categories
 Algorithm::NaiveBayes implements the classic "Naive Bayes" machine learning
 algorithm. It is a well-studied probabilistic algorithm often used in
 automatic text categorization. Compared to other algorithms (kNN, SVM,
 Decision Trees), it's pretty fast and reasonably competitive in the quality
 of its results.
