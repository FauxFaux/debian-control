Description: module for accessing perl variables through aliases
 You may find the Alias module useful if you:
 .
   * are tired of dereferencing hash-based object attributes
 .
   * wish perl could make-do with fewer $, -> and {} things
 .
   * are a little scared of using typeglobs
 .
   * want the freedom to put what you want, when you want in
     the symbol table without having to deal with weird syntax
 .
   * need to use scalar constants in your program since you don't
     trust yourself from changing $PI
