Description: helper  to build  Perl program using SDL libraries
 Perl's idea of a metapackage to provide C library dependencies for
 Perl SDL application.
 .
 When building from source, this package can be used to detect and get
 configuration settings from an installed SDL and related libraries. As
 a binary package, it provides information on native libs used when
 building this package.
 .
 Regarding the native C libraries, all packages built with
 libalien-sdl-perl must have at least the same build dependencies than
 libalien-sdl-perl. Since this list if not fun to maintain, this
 metapackage depends on all packages used to build libalien-sdl-perl
 (and also depends on libalien-sdl-perl).
