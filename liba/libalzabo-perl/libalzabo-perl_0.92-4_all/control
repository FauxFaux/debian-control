Description: Data modelling tool and RDBMS-OO mapper
 Alzabo is a suite of modules with two core functions. Its first use is as a
 data modelling tool. Through either a schema creation GUI, a perl program, or
 reverse engineering, you can create a set objects to represent a schema.
 .
 Its second function is as an RDBMS to object mapping system. Once you have
 created a schema, you can use the Alzabo::Runtime::Table and
 Alzabo::Runtime::Row classes to access its data.
