Description: AMBIsonics eXchange objects for Pure Data
 libambix is a library of C routines for reading and writing files following the
 "ambix" (AMBIsonics eXchange) conventions.
 .
 Ambisonics is a periphonic (3D) surround sound technique, with a scalable
 spatial resolution (put simply: "the more audio channels you use, the better").
 The ambix convention defines an extensible format for exchanging soundfiles
 containing Higher Order Ambisonics data.
 .
 This package contains a set of Pure Data (Pd) objects to interact with
 ambix-files:
  - [ambix_info]: information about ambix files
  - [ambix_read~]: play an ambix file (simple mode)
  - [ambix_readX~]: play an ambix file (extended mode)
  - [ambix_write~]: record an ambix file
