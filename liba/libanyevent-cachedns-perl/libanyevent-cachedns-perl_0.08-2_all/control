Description: simple DNS resolver with caching for AnyEvent
 AnyEvent::CacheDNS provides a very simple DNS resolver that caches its
 results and can improve the connection times to remote hosts.
 .
 It's possible to register this class as AnyEvent's main DNS resolver by
 passing the tag :register in the use statement.
 .
 This module is very basic and has no policies for clearing or invalidating
 the DNS cache.
