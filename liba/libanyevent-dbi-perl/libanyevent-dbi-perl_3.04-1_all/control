Description: module supporting asynchronous DBI access
 AnyEvent::DBI is an AnyEvent extension, you need to make sure that you use
 and run a supported event loop. This module implements asynchronous DBI access
 by forking or executing separate "DBI-Server" processes and sending them
 requests. It means that you can run DBI requests in parallel to other tasks.
 The overhead for very simple statements ("select 0") is somewhere around 100%
 to 120% (dual/single core CPU) compared to an explicit
 prepare_cached/execute/fetchrow_arrayref/finish combination.
