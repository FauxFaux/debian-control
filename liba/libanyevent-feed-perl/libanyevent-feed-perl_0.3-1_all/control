Description: Perl module to retrieve new entries in an RSS/Atom feed
 AnyEvent::Feed implements some glue between AnyEvent::HTTP and XML::Feed. It
 can fetch an RSS/Atom feed on a regular interval as well as at customized
 times. It also keeps track of already fetched entries so that you will only
 get the new entries.
