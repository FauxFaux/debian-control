Description: module to create new processes
 AnyEvent::Fork allows you to create new processes, without actually forking
 them from your current process (avoiding the problems of forking), but
 preserving most of the advantages of fork.
 .
 It can be used to create new worker processes or new independent subprocesses
 for short- and long-running jobs, process pools (e.g. for use in pre-forked
 servers) but also to spawn new external processes (such as CGI scripts from a
 web server), which can be faster (and more well behaved) than using fork+exec
 in big processes.
 .
 Special care has been taken to make this module useful from other modules,
 while still supporting specialised environments such as App::Staticperl or
 PAR::Packer.
