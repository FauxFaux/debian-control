Description: simple non-blocking HTTP/HTTPS client
 AnyEvent::HTTP is a simple non-blocking HTTP/HTTPS client implementation,
 which uses AnyEvent under the hood for asynchronous I/O. It supports GET,
 POST and other request methods, cookies and more. It is well suited to most
 HTTP tasks, while retaining fine-grained control over request and response
 headers to cater to more complex requirements.
