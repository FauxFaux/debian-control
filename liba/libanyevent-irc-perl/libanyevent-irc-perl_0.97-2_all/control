Description: Perl module for handling IRC connections
 AnyEvent::IRC is a Perl module that can be conceptualized as a toolbox for
 handling Internet Relay Chat (IRC) connections and communications. It won't
 do everything for you, and you still need to have a basic understanding of
 the internal protocol.
