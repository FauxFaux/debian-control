Description: Perl module that implements a non-blocking Redis client
 AnyEvent::Redis is a non-blocking (event-driven) Redis client based
 on the AnyEvent event loop framework.

 Redis is a key-value database in a similar vein to memcache but the dataset
 is non-volatile. Redis additionally provides native support for atomically
 manipulating and querying data structures such as lists and sets.
