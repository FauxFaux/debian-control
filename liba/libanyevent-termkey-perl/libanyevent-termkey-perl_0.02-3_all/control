Description: module for terminal key input using libtermkey with AnyEvent
 AnyEvent::TermKey implements an asynchronous perl wrapper around the
 libtermkey library, which provides an abstract way to read keypress events in
 terminal-based programs. It yields structures that describe keys, rather than
 simply returning raw bytes as read from the TTY device.
 .
 It internally uses an instance of Term::TermKey to access the underlying C
 library. For details on general operation, including the representation of
 keypress events as objects, see the documentation on that class.
 .
 Proxy methods exist for normal accessors of Term::TermKey, and the usual
 behaviour of the getkey or other methods is instead replaced by the on_key
 event.
