Description: module to read/write Apache like configuration files
 Apache::Admin::Config provides an object oriented interface to read
 and write Apache configuration files without affecting comments,
 indentation, or truncated lines.
 .
 You can easily extract information from Apache configuration files, or
 manage htaccess files.  An advantage over Apache::ConfigFile is that
 you can modify configuration files on disk, and generate new ones.
 .
 The class was specifically written for a hosting provider, where it is
 used to add new clients, activate features, (un)lock directories using
 htaccess, etc. It can also come in handy for writing a one-shot
 migration script in a few lines.
