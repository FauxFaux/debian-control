Description: perl Apache::ASP - Active Server Pages for Apache with mod_perl
 Apache::ASP provides an Active Server Pages port to the Apache Web
 Server with perl as the host scripting language. Active Server Pages is
 a web application platform that originated with the Microsoft NT/IIS
 server. Under Apache for Unix and Win32 platforms it allows a developer
 to create dynamic web applications with session management and embedded
 perl code.
 .
 This module works under the Apache Web Server with the mod_perl
 module enabled. See http://www.apache.org and http://perl.apache.org
 for further information.  It can also work under a standard CGI call
 interface using the asp-perl command.  See README.Debian in this
 package for more details.
 .
 This is a portable solution, similar to ActiveState's PerlScript for
 NT/IIS ASP. Work has been done and will continue to make ports to and
 from this implementation as smooth as possible.
