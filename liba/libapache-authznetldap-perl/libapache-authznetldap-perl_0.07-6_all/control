Description: Apache-Perl module that enables to authorize a user with LDAP attributes
 After you have authenticated a user (perhaps with Apache::AuthNetLDAP ;)
 you can use Apache::AuthzNetLDAP to determine whether they are authorized to
 access  the Web resource under this modules control.
 .
 You can control authorization via one of four methods. The first two are
 the pretty standard user and valid-user require, the second two are group or
 ldap-url which are unique to LDAP.
