Description: interface connecting Apache server to database via perl's DBI
 Apache::DBI and Apache::AuthDBI are to be used with the Apache server and
 an embedded perl interpreter like mod_perl. They provide support for basic
 authentication and authorization as well as support for persistent database
 connections via Perl's Database Independent Interface (DBI).
 .
  o AuthDBI.pm provides authentication and authorization:
    - optional shared cache for passwords to minimize database load
    - configurable cleanup-handler deletes outdated entries from the cache
 .
  o DBI.pm provides persistent database connections:
    - connections can be established during server-startup
    - configurable rollback to ensure data integrity
    - configurable verification of the connections to avoid time-outs.
