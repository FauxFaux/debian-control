Description: Perl module for tracking what's being transferred in a DBI database
 Apache::DBILogger tracks what's being transferred by the Apache web server
 in a SQL database (everything with a DBI/DBD driver). This allows one to
 get statistics (of almost everything) without having to parse the log
 files (like the Apache::Traffic module, just in a "real" database,
 and with a lot more logged information).
