Description: module to manage Unix crypt-style password file
 The Apache::Htpasswd module comes with a set of methods to use with htaccess
 password files. These files (and htaccess) are used to do Basic
 Authentication on a web server.
 .
 The passwords file is a flat-file with login name and their associated
 crypted password. You can use this for non-Apache files if you wish, but
 it was written specifically for .htaccess style files.
