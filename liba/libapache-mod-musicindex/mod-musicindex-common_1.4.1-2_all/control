Description: Common files for mod-musicindex
 mod_musicindex is aimed at being a C alternative to the Perl module
 Apache::MP3 (http://search.cpan.org/dist/Apache-MP3/).
 It allows nice displaying of directories containing MP3 or Ogg Vorbis and
 FLAC files, including sorting them on various fields, streaming/downloading
 them, constructing playlists and searching.
 .
 This package includes platform independent data for libapache2-mod-musicindex
 and is useless without it.
