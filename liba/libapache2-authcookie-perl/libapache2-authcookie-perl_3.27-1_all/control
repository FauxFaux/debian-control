Description: Perl Authentication and Authorization via cookies
 This module is for mod_perl version 2. If you are running mod_perl version 1,
 you should be using Apache::AuthCookie instead.
 .
 Apache2::AuthCookie allows you to intercept a user's first unauthenticated
 access to a protected document. The user will be presented with a custom form
 where they can enter authentication credentials. The credentials are posted
 to the server where AuthCookie verifies them and returns a session key.
 .
 The session key is returned to the user's browser as a cookie. As a cookie,
 the browser will pass the session key on every subsequent accesses. AuthCookie
 will verify the session key and re-authenticate the user.
