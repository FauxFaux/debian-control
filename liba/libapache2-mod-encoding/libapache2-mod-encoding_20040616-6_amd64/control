Description: Apache2 module for non-ascii filename interoperability
 This module improves non-ascii filename interoperability of
 apache (and mod_dav).
 .
 It seems many WebDAV clients send filename in its platform-local
 encoding. But since mod_dav expects everything, even HTTP request
 line, to be in UTF-8, this causes an interoperability problem.
 .
 I believe this is a future issue for specification (RFC?) to
 standardize encoding used in HTTP request-line and HTTP header,
 but life would be much easier if mod_dav (and others) can handle
 various encodings sent by clients, TODAY. This module does just that.
