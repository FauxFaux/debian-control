Description: FastCGI interface module for Apache 2
 This package contains mod_fcgid, a high-performance alternative to mod_cgi
 or mod_cgid. It starts a sufficient number of instances of the CGI program
 to handle concurrent requests. These programs remain running to handle
 further incoming requests.
 .
 It is a binary-compatible alternative to Apache module mod_fastcgi.
