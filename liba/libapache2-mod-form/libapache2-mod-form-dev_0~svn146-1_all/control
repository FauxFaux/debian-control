Description: Apache module to decode data submitted from Web forms (development files)
 mod_form is an Apache module to decode data submitted from Web forms.
 The decoded data is made available to other Apache modules through
 two optional functions exported by mod_form with
 APR_DECLARE_OPTIONAL_FN.
 .
 It deals with both GET and POST methods where the data are encoded
 using the default content type application/x-www-form-urlencoded.
 .
 This package contains the development files for Apache modules that
 wish to rely on mod_form.
