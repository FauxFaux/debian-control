Description: Apache module for logging of slow requests handling
 Provide measures of the time period used for handling each request by the
 current process. Logging is done after processing a request if the request
 takes more than certain period of time that you specify. The idea of this
 module comes from MySQL's slow-query-log, and its logging logic is partially
 based on mod_log_forensic.
