Description: module for reloading Perl modules when changed on disk
 Apache2::Reload reloads modules that change on the disk.
 .
 When Perl pulls a file via "require", it stores the filename in the global
 hash %INC. The next time Perl tries to "require" the same file, it sees the
 file in %INC and does not reload from disk. This module's handler can be
 configured to iterate over the modules in %INC and reload those that have
 changed on disk. It can also monitor only specific modules that have
 registered themselves with Apache2::Reload. It is possible to trigger the
 check only when a special touch-file has been modified, minimizing the number
 of stat() calls per request.
