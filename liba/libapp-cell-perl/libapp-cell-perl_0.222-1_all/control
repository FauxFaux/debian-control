Description: configuration, error-handling, localization, and logging "framework"
 App::CELL is the Configuration, Error-handling, Localization, and
 Logging (CELL) framework for applications written in Perl.
 .
 In the author's experience, applications written for "users" (however
 that term may be defined) frequently need to:
 .
  * be configurable by the user or site administrator
  * handle errors robustly, without hangs and crashes
  * potentially display messages in various languages
  * log various types of messages to syslog
 .
 Since these basic functions seem to work well together, CELL is
 designed to provide them in an integrated, well-documented,
 straightforward, and reusable package.
