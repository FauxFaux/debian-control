Description: Perl module to start an Application as a Daemon
 App::Daemon helps running an application as a daemon. The idea to prepend
 scripts with functions provided by this module to 'daemonize' it.
 .
 Along with the common features offered by similar modules on CPAN, it
  * supports logging with Log4perl: In background mode, it logs to a logfile. In
    foreground mode, log messages go directly to the screen.
  * detects if another instance is already running and ends itself
    automatically in this case.
  * shows with the 'status' command if an instance is already running and
    which PID it has.
