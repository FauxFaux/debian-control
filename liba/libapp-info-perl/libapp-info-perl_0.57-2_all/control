Description: module to provide metadata about software packages installed
 App::Info provides a generalized interface for providing metadata about
 software packages installed on a system. The idea is that App::Info
 subclasses can be used in Perl application installers in order to determine
 whether software dependencies have been fulfilled, and to get necessary
 metadata about those software packages.
