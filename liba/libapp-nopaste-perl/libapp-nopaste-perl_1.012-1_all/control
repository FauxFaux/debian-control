Description: application for easy access to any pastebin
 App::Nopaste is a Perl module and application collection to upload arbitrary
 text, usually code, to pastebins (also known as nopaste sites) for public
 viewing. They're used a lot in IRC channels to show code that would normally
 be too long to give directly in the channel.
 .
 Each pastebin is slightly different; this program attempts to encapsulate the
 differences between them and provide a unified, redundant interface to upload
 code. If one site doesn't work, it simply tries a different one.
