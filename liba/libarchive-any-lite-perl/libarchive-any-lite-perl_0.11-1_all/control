Description: simple CPAN package extractor
 Archive::Any::Lite is a fork of Archive::Any by Michael Schwern and
 Clint Moore. The main difference is that Archive::Any::Lite works
 properly even when you fork(), and may require less memory to extract a
 tarball. On the other hand, Archive::Any::Lite isn't pluggable (it only
 supports file formats used in the CPAN toolchains), and doesn't check
 mime types (at least as of this writing).
