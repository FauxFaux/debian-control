Description: API wrapper around the 'tar' utility
 Archive::Tar::Wrapper is an API wrapper around the 'tar' command line
 utility. It never stores anything in memory, but works on temporary directory
 structures on disk instead. It provides a mapping between the logical paths
 in the tarball and the 'real' files in the temporary directory on disk.
