Description: transitional dummy package for moving bsdtar to libarchive-tools
 The bsdtar program is the default system 'tar' program used on FreeBSD. bsdtar
 uses the libarchive library as a backend which does all of the work for reading
 and writing archives in various formats.
 .
 This is a transitional package for the migration of the bsdtar tool to
 the libarchive-tools package.
