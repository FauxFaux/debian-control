Description: module that converts an array into array of arrayrefs of uniform size N
 Array::Group is a module for converting a list into a list of arrayrefs
 of the same size. It exports two methods:
 .
  The ngroup method reformats a list into a list of arrayrefs. It is often
  used for formatting data into HTML tables, amongst other things.
 .
  dissect() returns a list of lists where the first element of each sublist
  will be one of the first elements of the source list, and the last element
  will be one of the last. This behaviour is much more useful when the input
  list is sorted.
 .
 The key difference between the two methods is that dissect() takes elements
 from the start of the list provided and pushes them onto each of the
 subarrays sequentially, rather than simply dividing the list into discrete
 chunks.
