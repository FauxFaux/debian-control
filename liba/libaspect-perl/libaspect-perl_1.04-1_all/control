Description: module for Aspect-Oriented Programming in Perl
 Aspect-oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming method developed by Xerox
 PARC and others. The basic idea is that in complex class systems there are
 certain aspects or behaviors that cannot normally be expressed in a coherent,
 concise and precise way. One example of such aspects are design patterns,
 which combine various kinds of classes to produce a common type of behavior.
 Another is logging. For more information, see <URL:http://www.aosd.net>.
 .
 The Perl Aspect module is focused on subroutine matching and wrapping. It
 allows you to select collections of subroutines using a flexible pointcut
 language, and modify their behavior in any way you want.
