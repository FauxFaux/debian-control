Description: asynchronous DNS resolver (development files)
 libasr provides a simple interface for asynchronous address resolution and
 nameserver querying. It should be used in place of the classical resolver
 functions of libc when blocking is not desirable. libasr is thread-safe and
 lock-free internally except for the two atypical use cases listed in
 asr_run(3).
 .
 This package provides the development files for libasr0.
