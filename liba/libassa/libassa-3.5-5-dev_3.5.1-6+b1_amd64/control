Description: object-oriented C++ networking library (development files)
 libASSA is an object-oriented C++ networking library based on Adaptive
 Communication Patterns. It features a simplistic implementation of the set
 of communication patterns such as Service Configurator, Reactor, Acceptor,
 Connector, and others described in various papers published by
 Dr. D. C. Schmidt.
 .
 libASSA happily co-exists with other frameworks such as GUI toolkits and
 various CORBA implementations
 .
 This package contains the header files and static libraries which are
 needed for developing applications and a program that generates
 skeleton files for RAD development with ASSA library.
