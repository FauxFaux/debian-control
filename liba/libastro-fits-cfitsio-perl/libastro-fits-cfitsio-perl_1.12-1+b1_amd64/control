Description: Perl extension for using the cfitsio library
 Astro::Fits::Cfitsio is a Perl interface to William Pence's cfitsio
 subroutine library. For more information on cfitsio, see
 http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio.
 .
 This module attempts to provide a wrapper for nearly every cfitsio routine,
 while retaining as much cfitsio behavior as possible. As such, one should
 be aware that it is still somewhat low-level, in the sense that handing an
 array which is not the correct size to a routine like fits_write_img()
 may cause SIGSEGVs.
 .
 The goal is to eventually use these routines to build a more Perl-like
 interface to many common tasks such as reading and writing of images and
 ASCII and binary tables.
