Description: module to allow C/XS libraries to interrupt perl
 Async::Interrupt is a Perl module that implements asynchronous interruptions,
 similar in nature to UNIX signals, in a cross-platform manner. Modules might
 want to run code asynchronously (in another thread or from a signal handler)
 and then signal the interpreter on certain events. One common way is to write
 data to a pipe and use an event handling toolkit to watch for I/O events.
 Another way is to send a signal. Those methods are slow, and in the case of a
 pipe, also not asynchronous - it won't interrupt a running Perl interpreter.
 .
 This module implements asynchronous notifications that enable you to signal
 running Perl code from another thread, asynchronously, and sometimes even
 without using a single syscall.
