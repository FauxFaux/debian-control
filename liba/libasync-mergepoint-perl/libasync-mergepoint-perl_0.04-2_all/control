Description: Perl module to resynchronize multiple control flows
 Async::Mergepoint is a module designed to provide a way to resynchronize
 multiple parallel control flows. Often in program logic, multiple different
 steps need to be taken that are independent of each other, but their total
 result is needed before the next step can be taken. In synchronous code, the
 usual approach is to do them sequentially.
 .
 An asynchronous or event-based program could do this, but if each step
 involves some IO idle time, better overall performance can often be gained by
 running the steps in parallel. A Async::MergePoint object can then be used to
 wait for all of the steps to complete, before passing the combined result of
 each step on to the next stage.
