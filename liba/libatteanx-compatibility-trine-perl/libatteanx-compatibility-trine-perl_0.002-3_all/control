Description: compatibility layer between RDF::Trine and Attean
 AtteanX::Compatibility::Trine provides a tiny shim
 for code written for RDF::Trine to instead use Attean.
 .
 RDF::Trine and Attean are both Perl frameworks
 for working with RDF data and SPARQL queries,
 the former using Moose and deprecated
 in favor of the latter using Moo.
 .
 SPARQL is an RDF query language,
 that is, a semantic query language for databases,
 able to retrieve and manipulate data
 stored in Resource Description Framework format.
 .
 Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard model
 for data interchange on the Web.
