Description: Perl interface to FLAC file header metadata
 Audio::FLAC::Header provides an object-oriented interface to FLAC file header
 and metadata, it returns a hash containing basic information about a FLAC
 file, a representation of the embedded cue sheet if one exists, as well as tag
 information contained in the FLAC file's Vorbis tags.
 .
 There is no complete list of tag keys for Vorbis tags, as they can be
 defined by the user; the basic set of tags used for FLAC files include:
 ALBUM, ARTIST, TITLE, DATE, GENRE, TRACKNUMBER, COMMENT.
