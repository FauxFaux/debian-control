Description: Audio masking threshold estimation library
 Evaluates the simultaneous masking threshold for audio. The masking threshold
 is a psychoacoustics property of the perception of sound. This threshold
 determines the cut-off in perception. Any Fourier signal below the threshold is
 not perceived by listeners.
 .
 Simultaneous masking is the basis of mp3 audio compression. This GPL
 implementation allows arbitrary sample rate and window sizes. It is extremely
 simple to use, rather cheap in computation complexity and gives great results.
 To alter the degree of masking (quality of the playback after compression),
 simply shift the threshold this library generates up and down.
