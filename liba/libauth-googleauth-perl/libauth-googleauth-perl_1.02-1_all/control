Description: Google Authenticator TOTP Abstraction
 Auth::GoogleAuth provides a simplified interface to supporting typical
 two-factor authentication with Google Authenticator using the TOTP
 Algorithm as defined by RFC 6238. Although Google Authenticator supports
 both TOTP and HOTP, at the moment, this module only supports TOTP.
