Description: Perl extension for creating captcha's
 Authen::Captcha provides an object oriented interface to captcha file
 creations. Captcha stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to
 tell Computers and Humans Apart. A Captcha is a program that can generate
 and grade tests that:
 .
   - Most humans can pass.
   - Current computer programs can't pass.
 .
 The most common form is an image file containing distorted text, which
 humans are adept at reading, and computers (generally) do a poor job.
 This module currently implements that method.
