Description: authentication module for NTLM
 Authen::NTLM provides methods to use NTLM authentication. It can
 be used as an authenticate method with the Mail::IMAPClient module
 to perform the challenge/response mechanism for NTLM connections
 or it can be used on its own for NTLM authentication with other
 protocols (eg. HTTP).
 .
 The implementation is a direct port of the code from fetchmail
 which, itself, has based its NTLM implementation on samba. As
 such, this code is not especially efficient, however it will still
 take a fraction of a second to negotiate a login on a PII which is
 likely to be good enough for most situations.
