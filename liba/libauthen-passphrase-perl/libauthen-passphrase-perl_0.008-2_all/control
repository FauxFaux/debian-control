Description: Perl module encapsulating hashed passwords/passphrases as objects
 Authen::Passphrase is the base class for a system of objects that encapsulate
 passphrases.  An object of this type is a passphrase recogniser: its
 job is to recognise whether an offered passphrase is the right one.
 For security, such passphrase recognisers usually do not themselves know
 the passphrase they are looking for; they can merely recognise it when
 they see it.  There are many schemes in use to achieve this effect,
 and the intent of this class is to provide a consistent interface to
 them all, hiding the details.
 .
 This package contains implementations of several specific passphrase schemes
 in addition to the base class.
