Description: Authen::SASL - SASL Authentication framework
 SASL is a generic mechanism for authentication used by several network
 protocols. Authen::SASL provides an implementation framework that all
 protocols should be able to share.
 .
 The framework allows different implementations of the connection class
 to be plugged in. At the time of writing there were two such plugins:
  - Authen::SASL::Perl
    This module implements several mechanisms and is implemented
    entirely in Perl.
  - Authen::SASL::Cyrus
    This module uses the Cyrus SASL C-library (both version 1 and 2 are
    supported).
