Description: module providing automatic methods for core functions
 This module provides automatic methods which wrap perl's built-in
 functions for minipulating numbers, strings, arrays, hashes, and code
 references. It can be handy to use built-in functions as methods to avoid
 messy dereferencing syntaxes and parentheses pile ups.
 .
 autobox::Core is what you'd call a stub module. It is merely glue, presenting
 existing functions with a new interface. Most of the methods read like sub
 hex ($) { hex($_[0]) }. Besides built-ins that operate on hashes, arrays,
 scalars, and code references, some Perl 6-ish things were thrown in, and some
 keywords like foreach have been turned into methods.
