Description: Perl pragma for method calls on native types
 autobox is a Perl pragma that enables method calls on Perl's native data types
 including numeric values (integers and floats), strings, arrays, hashes and
 even code references in a simple and consistent way.
 .
 When a method is invoked on something which is not a blessed object reference,
 autobox looks for the method in a package whose name corresponds to the ref()
 type of the value. This design means extending the default functionality for
 new methods on a type-by-type basis is very simple.
