Description: Ada Web Server utilities
 AWS is a complete framework to develop Web based applications. The
 main part of the framework is the embedded Web server. This small yet
 powerful Web server can be embedded into your application so your
 application will be able to talk with a Web browser. Around this Web
 server a lot of services have been developed.
 .
 This package contains utility programs to help develop web applications
 with AWS:
 .
 awsres transforms any text or binary file into an Ada unit which you
 can compile into your application, thereby making your application
 completely independent of any external files (think: embedded)
 .
 ada2wsdl, an ASIS program, reads Ada unit specifications and creates
 descriptions in the Web Service Description Language, so that you can
 advertise your web service application to the world.
 .
 wsdl2aws does the opposite job: it creates an Ada unit (spec and
 skeleton body) conforming to a specified description in WSDL.
