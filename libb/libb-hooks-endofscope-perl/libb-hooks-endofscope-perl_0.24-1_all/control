Description: module for executing code after a scope finished compilation
 B::Hooks::EndOfScope allows you to execute code when perl finished
 compiling the surrounding scope. It exports a single function,
 'on_scope_end $codeblock', which can be used e.g. for introspection in
 the constructor of your class.
