Description: module to allow annotation and delegation of hooked OPs
 B::Hooks::OP::Annotation provides a way for XS code that hijacks OP op_ppaddr
 functions to delegate to (or restore) the previous functions, whether they
 are assigned by perl or by another module. Typically this should be used in
 conjunction with B::Hooks::OP::Check (see libb-hooks-op-check-perl).
 .
 B::Hooks::OP::Annotation makes its types and functions available to XS code
 by means of ExtUtils::Depends (libextutils-depends-perl). Modules that wish
 to use these exports in their XS code should use B::OP::Hooks::Annotation in
 the Perl module that loads the XS.
