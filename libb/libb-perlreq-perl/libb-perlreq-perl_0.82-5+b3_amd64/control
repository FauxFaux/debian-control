Description: Perl module to determine Perl module dependencies
 B::PerlReq is a backend module for the Perl compiler that determines the
 dependencies of Perl source code, based on the internal structure that Perl
 creates itself after parsing a program source file. The output of this module
 is suitable for automatic dependency detection, tracking and organization,
 particularly for building and maintaining binary packages.
