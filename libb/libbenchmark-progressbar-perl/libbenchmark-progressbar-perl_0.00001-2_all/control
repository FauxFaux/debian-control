Description: Perl module that displays progress bar during benchmarking
 Benchmark::ProgressBar is a combination of Benchmark and Term::ProgressBar
 that produces a simple progress bar illustrating execution of benchmark
 runs. As such, it is particularly useful for heavy benchmarking tests
 that take a long time to complete.
 .
 You can use it as a drop-in replacement for Benchmark, but the only functions
 that would display a progress bar are: cmpthese, timethese and timeit.
 .
 This module is not compatible for use with Benchmark in the same script. The
 author doesn't know of any case where this would make sense.
