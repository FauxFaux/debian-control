Description: Perl module which reads ISIS databases
 This module will read ISIS databases created by DOS CDS/ISIS, WinIsis or
 IsisMarc.
 .
 Biblio::Isis is a Perl module which reads ISIS databases produced by
 CDS/ISIS programs, such as MicroISIS, WinISIS and IsisMARC. ISIS was a
 popular family of integrated library systems provided as freeware by
 UNESCO, and this module provides methods to parse full databases and
 use them in a Perl program in order to migrate them to other formats.
 .
 It can create hash values from data in ISIS database (using to_hash),
 ASCII dump (using to_ascii) or just hash with field names and packed
 values (like ^asomething^belse).
 .
 Unique feature of this module is ability to include_deleted records.
 It will also skip zero sized fields (OpenIsis has a bug in XS bindings, so
 fields which are zero sized will be filled with random junk from memory).
 .
 It also has support for identifiers (only if ISIS database is created by
 IsisMarc), see to_hash.
