Description: parser for BIND Config files
 BIND::Config::Parser provides a lightweight parser to the configuration file
 syntax of BIND v8 and v9 using a Parse::RecDescent grammar.
 .
 It is in a similar vein to BIND::Conf_Parser. However, as it has no knowledge
 of the directives, it doesn't need to be kept updated as new directives are
 added, it simply knows how to carve up a BIND configuration file into logical
 chunks.
