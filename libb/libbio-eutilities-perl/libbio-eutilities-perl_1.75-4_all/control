Description: BioPerl interface to the Entrez Programming Utilities (E-utilities)
 The Bioperl project is a coordinated effort to collect computational
 methods routinely used in bioinformatics into a set of standard
 CPAN-style, well-documented, and freely available Perl modules.  This
 package provides a programmatic interface to NCBI's Entrez Programming
 Utilities commonly referred to as E-utilities.  Namely, it provides the
 Bio::DB::EUtilities and Bio::Tools::EUtilities perl modules.
 .
 Entrez is a federated search engine at the National Center for
 Biotechnology Information (NCBI) for a large number of databases
 covering a variety of biomedical data, including nucleotide and
 protein sequences, gene records, three-dimensional molecular
 structures, and the biomedical literature.  E-utilities are a set of
 eight server-side programs that provide a stable interface into the
 Entrez query and database system at the National Center for
 Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
