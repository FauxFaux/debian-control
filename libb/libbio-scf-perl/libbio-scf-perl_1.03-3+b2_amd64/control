Description: Perl extension for reading and writing SCF sequence files
 The Bio::SCF (Standard Chromatogram Format) module allows you to read and
 update (in a restricted way) SCF chromatographic sequence files. It is an
 interface to Roger Staden's io-lib. It has both tied hash and an
 object-oriented interfaces. It provides the ability to read fields from SCF
 files and limited ability to modify them and write them back.
