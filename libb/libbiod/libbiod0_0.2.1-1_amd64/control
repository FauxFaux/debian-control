Description: bioinformatics library in D
 BioD is a fast and memory efficient bioinformatics library written in
 the D programming language. BioD aims to:
  * Provide a platform for writing high-performance bioinformatics
    applications in D. BioD achieves this by:
    - automatic parallelization of tasks where possible for example
      reading and writing BAM files.
    - reducing the GC overhead by avoiding unnecessary memory allocations
  * Offer support for manipulating common biological data formats.
  * Write clear documented and maintainable codebase.
 .
 This package contains the dynamic library.
