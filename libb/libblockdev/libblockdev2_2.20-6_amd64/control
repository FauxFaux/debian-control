Description: Library for manipulating block devices
 libblockdev is a C library with GObject introspection support that can be used
 for doing low-level operations with block devices like setting up LVM, BTRFS,
 LUKS or MD RAID.
 .
 The library uses plugins (LVM, BTRFS,...) and serves as a thin wrapper around
 its plugins' functionality. All the plugins, however, can be used as
 standalone libraries. One of the core principles of libblockdev is that it is
 stateless from the storage configuration's perspective (e.g. it has no
 information about VGs when creating an LV).
