Description: Bloom filter implemented in Perl
 A Bloom filter is a probabilistic algorithm for doing existence tests
 in less memory than a full list of keys would require.  The tradeoff to
 using Bloom filters is a certain configurable risk of false positives.
 .
 Bloom::Filter is a Perl library implementing a simple Bloom filter with
 configurable capacity and false positive rate.
