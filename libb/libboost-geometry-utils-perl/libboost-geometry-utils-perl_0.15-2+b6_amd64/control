Description: Perl module providing bindings to the Boost Geometry library
 Boost::Geometry::Utils provides bindings to perform some geometric
 operations using the Boost Geometry library. It does not aim at
 providing full bindings for such library, which is why the
 Boost::Geometry namespace was left free.
