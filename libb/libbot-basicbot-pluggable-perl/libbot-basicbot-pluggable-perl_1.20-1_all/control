Description: extended simple IRC bot for pluggable modules
 Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable started as Yet Another Infobot replacement,
 but now is a generalized framework for writing infobot-type bots that
 lets you keep each specific function separate. You can have separate modules
 for factoid tracking, 'seen' status, karma, googling, etc.
 Included default modules are:
 .
  Auth    - user authentication and main access.
  DNS     - host lookup (e.g. nslookup and dns).
  Google  - search Google for things.
  Infobot - handles infobot-style factoids.
  Join    - joins and leaves channels.
  Karma   - tracks the popularity of things.
  Loader  - loads and unloads modules as bot commands.
  Seen    - tells you when people were last seen.
  Title   - gets the title of URLs mentioned in channel.
  Vars    - changes module variables.
