Description: text training material for bots
 Markov bots like Hailo and AI::MegaHAL are fun. But to get them
 working you either need to train them on existing training material or
 make your own.
 .
 Bot::Training provides a pluggable way to install already existing
 training files via the CPAN. It also comes with a command-line
 interface called bot-training.
