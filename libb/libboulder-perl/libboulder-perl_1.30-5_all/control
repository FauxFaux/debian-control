Description: Perl module for hierarchical tag/value structures
 Boulder provides a simple stream-oriented format for transmitting data
 objects between one or more processes.  It does not provide for the
 serialization of Perl objects the way FreezeThaw or Data::Dumper do,
 but it does provide the advantage of being language independent.
 .
 In addition to a stream-oriented interface, Boulder comes with a
 simple record-oriented database-oriented interface, Boulder::Store,
 which provides query and search capabilities comparable to many flat
 file DBMS systems.
