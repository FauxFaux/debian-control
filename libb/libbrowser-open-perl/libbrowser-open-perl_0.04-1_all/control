Description: Perl module to open a browser in a given URL
 The functions optionaly exported by Browser::Open allows you to open URLs in
 the user browser.
 .
 A set of known commands per OS-name is tested for presence, and the first one
 found is executed. With an optional parameter, all known commands are
 checked.
 .
 The "open_browser" uses the system() function to execute the command. If you
 want more control, you can get the command with the "open_browser_cmd" or
 "open_browser_cmd_all" functions and then use whatever method you want to
 execute it.
