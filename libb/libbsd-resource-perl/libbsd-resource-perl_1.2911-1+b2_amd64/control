Description: BSD process resource limit and priority functions
 The BSD::Resource module provides the BSD process resource limit functions
 getrusage(), getrlimit(), setrlimit() and the BSD process priority functions.
 .
 These are also available via core Perl but here the PRIO_* constants are
 available: getpriority(), setpriority().
 .
 Also provided is times() which provides the same functionality as the one
 in core Perl, only with better time resolution.
