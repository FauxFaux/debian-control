Description: Perl XS implementation of MongoDB's BSON serialization
 The BSON class implements a BSON encoder/decoder ("codec"). It consumes
 "documents" (typically hash references) and emits BSON strings and vice versa
 in accordance with the BSON Specification (http://bsonspec.org).
 .
 BSON is the primary data representation for MongoDB. While this module has
 several features that support MongoDB-specific needs and conventions, it can
 be used as a standalone serialization format.
 .
 BSON::XS contains an XS implementation for BSON encoding and decoding.
 There is no public API. Use the BSON module and it will choose the best
 implementation for you.
