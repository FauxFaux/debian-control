Description: command line CD/DVD/BD writing tool
 cdrskin strives to be a second source for the services traditionally
 provided by cdrecord. It writes data sessions to CD, DVD, or BD media.
 To CD media it may also write audio sessions.
 Multi-session is possible on all media types except DVD-R DL and
 fastly blanked DVD-RW.
 .
 This is a burner-only application. If you want a burner and ISO 9660 image
 manipulation application, please install the xorriso package.
