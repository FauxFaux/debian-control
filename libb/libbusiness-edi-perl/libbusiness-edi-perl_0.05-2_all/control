Description: class for generating U.N. EDI interchange objects
 The focus of Business::EDI is to provide object based access to EDI messages
 and subelements. At present, the EDI input processed by Business::EDI objects
 is JSON from the edi4r ruby library, and there is no EDI output beyond the
 perl objects themselves.
