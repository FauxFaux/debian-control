Description: data pack for Business::ISBN
 Business::ISBN::Data contains the data for Business::ISBN to do its work. It
 is current as per the version of this package.
 .
 You can update Business::ISBN::Data independently of this module as the
 various ISBN organizations assign new publisher codes. The ISBN agency lists
 these data on their website at http://www.isbn-international.org/, and a
 current RangeMessage.xml file can be downloaded from
 http://www.isbn-international.org/agency?rmxml=1 and will be used by this
 module in preference of the included data when pointed to by the
 ISBN_RANGE_MESSAGE environment variable.
 .
 Note, that as a historical artifact, some countries are actually language
 areas. For instance, country code 2 is "French", and includes several
 French-speaking countries.
