Description: Perl extension for online payment processing
 Business::OnlinePayment is a generic module for processing payments through
 online credit card processors, online check acceptance houses, etc.  (If you
 like buzzwords, call it an "multiplatform ecommerce-enabling middleware
 solution").
 .
 IMPORTANT: Business::OnlinePayment only defines the frontend interface to the
 system, in order to use it you also need to have at least one backend
 processing module installed.
