Description: helper library for packaging JRuby
 This library provides the org.jruby.util.ByteList byte container.

 ByteList is simple a collection of bytes in the same way a Java
 String is a collection of characters. However, its API resembles
 StringBuffer/StringBuilder more than String because it is a mutable
 object.
