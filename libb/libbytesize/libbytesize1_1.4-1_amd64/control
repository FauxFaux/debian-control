Description: library for common operations with sizes in bytes
 Many projects need to work with sizes in bytes (be it sizes of storage
 space, memory,...) and all of them need to deal with the same issues
 like:
 .
  * How to get a human-readable string for the given size?
  * How to store the given size so that no significant information is lost?
  * If we store the size in bytes, what if the given size gets over the
    MAXUINT64 value?  How to interpret sizes entered by users according
    to their locale and typing conventions?
  * How to deal with the decimal/binary units (MB vs. MiB) ambiguity?
  .
  This library aims to be as much generally usable as possible, small, fast and
  be easily interfaced from other languages.
