Description: Virtual Common Access Card (CAC) Emulator (runtime library)
 This emulator is designed to provide emulation of actual smart cards to a
 virtual card reader running in a guest virtual machine. The emulated smart
 cards can be representations of real smart cards, where the necessary
 functions such as signing, card removal/insertion, etc. are mapped to real,
 physical cards which are shared with the client machine the emulator is
 running on, or the cards could be pure software constructs.
 .
 This package provides the runtime library.
