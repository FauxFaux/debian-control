Description: simple data caching service with time history
 Cache::Historical provides simple methods to store and search text values
 that are tied to a time and a key, like user or category. Each caching
 operation sets a time stamp, thus making it possible to search according
 to events in time. Like the name suggests, it was originally conceived
 for recording of historic events such as stock trading.
 .
 This module uses SQLite3 as database backend, thus leaving ample space
 for costumized additional tools to the same cached historic data.
