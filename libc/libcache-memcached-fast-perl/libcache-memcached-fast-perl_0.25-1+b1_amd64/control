Description: Perl client for memcached, in C language
 Cache::Memcached::Fast is a Perl client for memcached, a memory cache
 daemon (http://www.danga.com/memcached/). Module core is implemented in
 C and tries hard to minimize number of system calls and to avoid any
 key/value copying for speed. As a result, it has very low CPU
 consumption.
 .
 API is largely compatible with Cache::Memcached, original pure Perl
 client, most users of the original module may start using this module
 by installing it and adding "::Fast" to the old name in their scripts.
