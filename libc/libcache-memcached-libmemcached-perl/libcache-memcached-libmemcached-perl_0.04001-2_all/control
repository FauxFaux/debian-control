Description: cache interface to Memcached::libmemcached
 Cache::Memcached::libmemcached is the Cache::Memcached compatible interface to
 libmemcached, a C library to interface with memcached.
 .
 Cache::Memcached::libmemcached is built on top of Memcached::libmemcached.
 While Memcached::libmemcached aims to port libmemcached API to perl,
 Cache::Memcached::libmemcached attempts to be API compatible with
 Cache::Memcached, so it can be used as a drop-in replacement.
 .
 Cache::Memcached::libmemcached inherits from Memcached::libmemcached. While you
 are free to use the Memcached::libmemcached specific methods directly on the
 object, doing so will mean that your code is no longer compatible with the
 original Cache::Memcached API therefore losing some of the portability in case
 you want to replace it with some other package.
