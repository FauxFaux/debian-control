Description: Perl module for using memcached servers
 Cache::Memcached is a module that interfaces with the memcached distributed
 memory cache daemon. Danga Interactive's memcached is a generic memory object
 caching system, often used to accelerate dynamic web sites by reducing load
 on slower databases. (See the memcached package)
 .
 This module allows Perl authors to quickly set and retrieve key/data pairs
 from memcached servers, even clusters of multiple daemons. As such, it is
 used to power several large-scale and high-performance web sites, including
 LiveJournal and Slashdot.
