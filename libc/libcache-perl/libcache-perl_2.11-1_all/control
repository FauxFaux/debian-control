Description: Cache interface
 Cache is designed to assist a developer in persisting data for a
 specified period of time.  Often these modules are used in web applications to
 store data locally to save repeated and redundant expensive calls to remote
 machines or databases.
 .
 The Cache interface is implemented by derived classes that store cached data
 in different manners (such as files on a filesystem, or in memory).
