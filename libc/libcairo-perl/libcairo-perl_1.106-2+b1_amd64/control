Description: Perl interface to the Cairo graphics library
 libcairo-perl provides access to the Cairo library.
 .
 Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple
 output devices. It is designed to produce consistent output
 on all output media while taking advantage of display hardware
 acceleration when available (eg. through the X Render Extension).
 .
 The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing
 operators of PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo including
 stroking and filling cubic BÃ©zier splines, transforming and compositing
 translucent images, and antialiased text rendering. All drawing
 operations can be transformed by any affine transformation (scale,
 rotation, shear, etc.)
 .
