Description: PDF manipulation library
 CAM::PDF reads and writes any document that conforms to the PDF specification

 2013).
 .
 The file format through PDF 1.5 is well-supported, with the exception of the
 "linearized" or "optimized" output format, which this module can read but not
 write. Many specific aspects of the document model are not manipulable with
 this package (like fonts), but if the input document is correctly written,
 then this module will preserve the model integrity.
 .
 The PDF writing feature saves as PDF 1.4-compatible. That means that
 compressed object streams cannot be written. The consequence is that reading
 and then writing a PDF 1.5+ document may enlarge the resulting file by a fair
 margin.
