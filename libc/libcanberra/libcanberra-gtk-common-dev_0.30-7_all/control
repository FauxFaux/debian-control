Description: simple interface for playing event sounds (GTK+ shared development files)
 libcanberra-gtk provides a few functions that simplify
 libcanberra usage from GTK+.
 .
 Contextual information is needed to play event sound. This library
 can help to compile directly event sounds property lists based on
 active GtkWidget objects or GdkEvent events.
 .
 This package contains common headers for developing
 applications using libcanberra-gtk and libcanberra-gtk3
