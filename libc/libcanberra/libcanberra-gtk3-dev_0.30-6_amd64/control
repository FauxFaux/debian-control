Description: simple interface for playing event sounds (GTK+ 3 development files)
 libcanberra-gtk3 provides a few functions that simplify
 libcanberra usage from GTK+ 3.0.
 .
 Contextual information is needed to play event sound. This library
 can help to compile directly event sounds property lists based on
 active GtkWidget objects or GdkEvent events.
 .
 This package contains headers and libraries for developing
 applications that play event sounds with libcanberra-gtk.
