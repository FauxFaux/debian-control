Description: Perl enhancement to Carp error logging facilities
 Carp::Clan is a Perl module designed to report errors from the perspective
 of the caller of a "clan" of modules, similar to "Carp" itself. Instead of
 giving it a number of levels to skip on the calling stack, you give it a
 pattern to characterize the package names of the "clan" of modules which
 shall never be blamed for any error.
 .
 These modules stick together like a "clan" and any error which occurs will
 be blamed on the "outsider" script or modules not belonging to this clan.
