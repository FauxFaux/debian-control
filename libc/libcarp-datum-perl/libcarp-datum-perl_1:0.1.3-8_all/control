Description: Debugging And Tracing Ultimate Module (for perl)
 Carp::Datum implements the following features:
 .
  * Programming by contract: pre-conditions, post-conditions, assertions.
  * Flow control tracing: routine entry, arguments, returned values
  * Dynamic (i.e. runtime) configuration via mini language to tailor
    debugging and/or tracing at the routine / file / package / type level.
  * Ability to statically remove all assertions and flow control tracing
    hooks in modules making use of Carp::Datum.
  * Cooperation with Log::Agent for tracing.
