Description: module for applying roles to action instances
 Catalyst::Controller::ActionRole allows one to apply Moose::Roles to the
 Catalyst::Actions for different controller methods.
 .
 As of version 5.90013, Catalyst has merged this functionality into the core
 Catalyst::Controller. You should no longer use this module for new
 development and it is recommended to switch to the core controller as soon as
 practical.
