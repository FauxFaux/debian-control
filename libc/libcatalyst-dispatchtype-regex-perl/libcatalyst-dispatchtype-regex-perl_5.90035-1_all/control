Description: Regex DispatchType for Catalyst
 Catalyst::DispatchType::Regex has been deprecated and removed from Catalyst
 core. If your application depends on regex dispatch, you can install this
 package to keep things working while migrating to Chained methods or other
 techniques.
 .
 Please note that as part of the refactoring, the dispatch priority of
 Regex vs Regexp vs LocalRegex vs LocalRegexp may have changed. Priority
 is now influenced by when the dispatch type is first seen in your
 application.
