Description: Database model class for Catalyst
 Catalyst::Model::DBI is the DBI model class for Catalyst.
 .
 There are two options for doing custom models with Catalyst. Either by using
 this model and any related modules as needed or by having a custom model
 decoupled from Catalyst and glued on using Catalyst::Model::Adaptor
 .
 Some general rules are as follows. If you do not wish to use DBIx::Connector
 or DBI directly and setup connections in your custom models or have glue
 models, then use this model. If you however need models that can be re-used
 outside of your application or simply wish to maintain connection code
 yourself outside of the Catalyst, then use Catalyst::Model::Adaptor which
 allows you to glue outside models into your Catalyst app.
 .
 Catalyst is an elegant Model-View-Controller web application framework
 written in Perl.
 .
 DBI is a Perl database interface.
