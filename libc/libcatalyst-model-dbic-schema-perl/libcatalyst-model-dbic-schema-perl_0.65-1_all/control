Description: DBIx::Class::Schema-based database model for Catalyst
 Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema is a Catalyst database model class for
 DBIx::Class::Schema-based Models. See the documentation for
 Catalyst::Helper::Model::DBIC::Schema for information on generating these
 Models via Helper scripts.
 .
 When a Catalyst app starts up, a thin Model layer is created as an interface
 to the DBIC Schema. It should be clearly noted that the model object returned
 by $c->model('FilmDB') is NOT itself a DBIC schema or resultset object, but
 merely a wrapper proving methods to access the underlying schema.
 .
 In addition to this model class, a shortcut class is generated for each
 source in the schema, allowing easy and direct access to a resultset of the
 corresponding type. These generated classes are even thinner than the model
 class, providing no public methods but simply hooking into Catalyst's model()
 accessor via the ACCEPT_CONTEXT mechanism.
 .
 Catalyst is an elegant Model-View-Controller web application framework
 written in Perl.
