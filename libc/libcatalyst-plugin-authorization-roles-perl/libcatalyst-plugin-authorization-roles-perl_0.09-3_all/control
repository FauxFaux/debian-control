Description: Role based authorization plugin for Catalyst
 Catalyst::Plugin::Authorization::Roles provides role-based authorization
 (access control) for Catalyst applications.
 .
 Role based access control is very simple: every user has a list of roles,
 which that user is allowed to assume, and every restricted part of the app
 makes an assertion about the necessary roles.
 .
 With assert_user_roles, if the user is a member in all of the required roles
 access is granted. Otherwise, access is denied. With assert_any_user_role it
 is enough that the user is a member of one role.
 .
 There are alternative approaches to do this on a per action basis, see
 Catalyst::ActionRole::ACL.
 .
 Catalyst is an elegant Model-View-Controller web application framework
 written in Perl.
