Description: flexible caching support for Catalyst
 Catalyst::Plugin::Cache gives you access to a variety of systems for caching
 data. It allows you to use a very simple configuration API, while maintaining
 the possibility of flexibility when you need it later.
 .
 Among its features are support for multiple backends, segmentation based on
 component or controller, keyspace partitioning, and so more, in various
 subsidiary plugins.
 .
 Catalyst is an elegant Model-View-Controller web application framework
 written in Perl.
