Description: module providing configurable URIs for Catalyst
 Configure whether $c->uri_for and $c->req->uri_with return absolute, hostless
 or relative URIs, or URIs based on the 'Host' header. Also allows configuring
 which URI class to use. Works on application-wide or per-request basis.
 .
 Catalyst::Plugin::SmartURI is useful in situations where you're for example,
 redirecting to a lighttpd from a firewall rule, instead of a real proxy, and
 you want your links and redirects to still work correctly.
 .
 To use your own URI class, just subclass URI::SmartURI and set uri_class, or
 write a class that follows the same interface.
 .
 This plugin installs a custom $c->request_class, however it does so in a way
 that won't break if you've already set $c->request_class yourself, ie. by
 using Catalyst::Action::REST (thanks mst!).
