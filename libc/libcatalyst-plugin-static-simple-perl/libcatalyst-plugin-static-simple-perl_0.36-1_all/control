Description: Catalyst plugin for easy serving of static pages
 Catalyst::Plugin::Static::Simple is designed to make serving static content
 in your application during development quick and easy, without requiring a
 single line of code from you.
 .
 This plugin detects static files by looking at the file extension in the URL
 (such as .css or .png or .js). The plugin uses the lightweight MIME::Types
 module to map file extensions to IANA-registered MIME types, and will serve
 your static files with the correct MIME type directly to the browser, without
 being processed through Catalyst.
 .
 Catalyst is an elegant Model-View-Controller web application framework
 written in Perl.
