Description: Unicode support for Catalyst (old style)
 At request time Catalyst::Plugin::Unicode decodes all params from UTF-8
 octets into a sequence of logical characters. On response, encodes body into
 UTF-8 octets.
 .
 Note that this plugin tries to autodetect if your response is encoded into
 characters before trying to encode it into a byte stream. This is *bad*
 as sometimes it can guess wrongly and cause problems.
 .
 As an example, latin1 characters such as Ã© (e-accute) will not actually
 cause the output to be encoded as utf8.
 .
 Using Catalyst::Plugin::Unicode::Encoding (part of Catalyst 5.90042, packaged
 in libcatalyst-perl) is much more recommended, and that also does additional
 things (like decoding file upload filenames and request parameters which this
 plugin does not).
 .
 This plugin should be considered deprecated, but is maintained as a large
 number of applications are using it already.
 .
 Catalyst is an elegant Model-View-Controller web application framework
 written in Perl.
