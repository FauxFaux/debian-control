Description: Use subincludes in your Catalyst views
 Catalyst::View::Component::SubInclude allows you to include content in
 your templates (or, more generally, somewhere in your view's render
 processing) which comes from another action in your application. It's
 implemented as a Moose::Role, so using Moose in your view is required.
