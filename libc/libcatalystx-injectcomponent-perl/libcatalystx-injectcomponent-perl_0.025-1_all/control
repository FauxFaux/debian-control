Description: module for injecting components into Catalyst applications
 CatalystX::InjectComponent will inject Controller, Model, and View
 components into Catalyst applications at setup (run)time. It does
 this by creating a new package on-the-fly, having that package extend
 the given component, and then having Catalyst setup the new component
 (via "->setup_component").
