Description: modules for handling RDF data within the Catmandu framework
 Catmandu provides a suite of Perl modules to ease the import, storage,
 retrieval, export and transformation of metadata records.
 .
 Catmandu::RDF contains modules for handling RDF data within the Catmandu
 framework.  RDF data is encoded/decoded in aREF as implemented with
 RDF::aREF.  Please keep in mind that RDF is a graph-based data
 structuring format with specialized technologies such as SPARQL and
 triple stores.  Using Catmandu::RDF to transform RDF to RDF (e.g.
 conversion from one RDF serialization to another) is possible but
 probably less performant than decent RDF tools.  Catmandu::RDF,
 however, is more conventient to convert between RDF and other data
 formats.
