Description: CCP4 core functionality - fortran runtime
 The CCP4 software suite is based around a library of routines which
 cover common tasks, such as file opening, parsing keyworded input,
 reading and writing of standard data formats, applying symmetry
 operations, etc. Programs in the suite call these routines which, as
 well as saving the programmer some effort, ensure that the varied
 programs in the suite have a similar look-and-feel.
 .
 The library contains several sub components:
 .
  * CMTZ library -- Contains a variety of functions for manipulating
    the data structure, for example adding crystals, datasets or
    columns. The data structure can be dumped to an output MTZ data
    file.
 .
  * CMAP library -- Functions defining the C-level API for accessing
   CCP4 map files.
 .
  * CSYM library -- a collection of functions centered around a data
   file syminfo.lib which is auto-generated from sgtbx (the Space
   Group Toolbox of cctbx).
 .
  * CCP4 utility library -- many utility functions which either give
   specific CCP4 or platform independent functionality.
 .
  * CCP4 Parser library -- provides CCP4-style parsing, as used for
   processing keywords of CCP4 programs, MTZ header records, etc.
 .
  * CCP4 resizable arrays -- defines an object and methods which looks
   just like a simple C array, but can be resized at will without
   incurring excessive overheads. This package contains the shared
   library components needed for programs that have been compiled with
   the libccp4 library.
 .
 This package provides the runtime of the CCP4 fortran library.
