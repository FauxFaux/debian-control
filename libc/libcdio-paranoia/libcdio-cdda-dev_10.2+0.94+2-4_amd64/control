Description: library to read and control digital audio CDs (development files)
 This package contains development files (headers and static library)
 for the libcdio-cdda library.
 .
 This library is made to read and control digital audio CDs. It does
 not play such CDs, it only reads them digitally. As it uses libcdio as
 a backend, it supports the same kind of CDROM drives (and images) as
 libcdio.
