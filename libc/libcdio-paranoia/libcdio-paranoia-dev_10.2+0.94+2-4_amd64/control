Description: library to read digital audio CDs with error correction (development files)
 This package contains development files (headers and static library)
 for the libcdio-paranoia library.
 .
 This library is made to read digital audio CDs, with error
 correction. It does its best to correct errors and jitter that happen
 when reading such discs. As it uses libcdio as a backend, it supports
 the same kind of CDROM drives (and images) as libcdio.
