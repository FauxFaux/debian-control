Description: C-based curses widget library
 CDK stands for "Curses Development Kit". CDK sits on top of the curses
 library and provides 22 ready to use widgets for rapid application
 development of text-based interfaces. CDK delivers many of the common
 widget types required for a robust interface. Widgets can be combined
 to create complex widgets if needed.
