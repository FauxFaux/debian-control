Description: C++11 library for serialization HTML documentation
 cereal is a header-only C++11 serialization library. cereal takes arbitrary
 data types and reversibly turns them into different representations, such as
 compact binary encodings, XML, or JSON. cereal was designed to be fast,
 light-weight, and easy to extend - it has no external dependencies and can be
 easily bundled with other code or used standalone.
 .
 This package contains the HTML documentation.
