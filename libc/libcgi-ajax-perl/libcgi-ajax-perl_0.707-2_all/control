Description: Perl-specific system for writing Asynchronous web applications
 CGI::Ajax is an object-oriented module that provides a unique mechanism
 for using Perl code asynchronously from JavaScript-enhanced HTML pages.
 CGI::Ajax unburdens the user from having to write extensive JavaScript,
 except for associating an exported method with a document-defined event
 (such as onClick, onKeyUp, etc.). CGI::Ajax also mixes well with HTML
 containing more complex JavaScript.
 .
 CGI::Ajax supports methods that return single results or multiple
 results to the web page, and supports returning values to multiple
 DIV elements on the HTML page.
 .
 Using CGI::Ajax, the URL for the HTTP GET/POST request is automatically
 generated based on HTML layout and events, and the page is then
 dynamically updated with the output from the perl function.  Additionally,
 CGI::Ajax supports mapping URL's to a CGI::Ajax function name, so you
 can separate your code processing over multiple scripts.
 .
 A primary goal of CGI::Ajax is to keep the module streamlined and
 maximally flexible. We are trying to keep the generated javascript code
 to a minimum, but still provide users with a variety of methods for
 deploying CGI::Ajax. And VERY little user JavaScript.
