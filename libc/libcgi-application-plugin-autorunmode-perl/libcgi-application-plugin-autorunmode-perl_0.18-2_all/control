Description: CGI::App plugin to automatically register runmodes
 The CGI::Application::Plugin::AutoRunmode plugin for CGI::Application
 provides easy ways to setup run modes. You can just write the method that
 implements a run mode. You do not have to explicitly register it with
 CGI::Application anymore.
 .
 You can either flag methods in your CGI::App subclass with the "Runmode" or
 "StartRunmode" attributes or simply declare that every method in a class is a
 run mode. You can also assign a delegate object, all whose methods will
 become runmodes. You can also mix both approaches.
