Description: plugin adding database support to CGI::Application
 CGI::Application::Plugin::DBH adds access to a DBI database handle to
 your CGI::Application modules. Lazy loading is used to prevent a database
 connection from being made if the dbh method is not called during the
 request.  In other words, the database connection is not created until it is
 actually needed.
