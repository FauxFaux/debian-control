Description: plugin that adds Log::Dispatch support to CGI::Application
 CGI::Application::Plugin::LogDispatch adds logging support to your
 CGI::Application modules by providing a Log::Dispatch dispatcher object that
 is accessible from anywhere in the application.
 .
 If you have CGI::Application::Plugin::DevPopup installed, a "Log Entries"
 report is added to the popup window, containing all of the entries that were
 logged during the execution of the runmode.
