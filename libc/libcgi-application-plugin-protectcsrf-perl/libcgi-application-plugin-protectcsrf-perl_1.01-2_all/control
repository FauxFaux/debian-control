Description: plugin to generate and verify anti-CSRF challenges
 CGI::Application::Plugin::ProtectCSRF is a CGI::Application plugin that
 helps protect against CSRF attacks. It works by tying back the processing
 of a form to the display of a form.
 .
 A cross-site request forgery is a form of online attack in which Mr Attacker
 posts what appears to be an image in, say, a forum. However the image src
 attribute is carefully crafted to undertake some action desired by Mr Attacker
 on the target website. The trap is sprung when Mr Victim, logs on to the
 target website and then views the image set up by Mr Attacker in the same
 browser.
