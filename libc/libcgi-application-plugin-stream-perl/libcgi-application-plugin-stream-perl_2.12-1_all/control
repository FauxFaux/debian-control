Description: plugin that adds file streaming support to CGI::Application
 CGI::Application::Plugin::Stream provides a way to stream a file back to the
 user from a CGI::Application module. This is useful if you are creating a PDF
 or Spreadsheet document dynamically to deliver to the user. The file is read
 and printed in small chunks to keep memory consumption down. If you pass
 along a filehandle it will be automatically closed on completion.
