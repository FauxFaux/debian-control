Description: plugin that adds Template Toolkit support to CGI::Application
 CGI::Application::Plugin::TT adds support for the popular Template Toolkit
 engine to your CGI::Application modules by providing several helper methods
 that allow you to process template files from within your runmodes. It
 compliments the support for HTML::Template that is built into CGI::Application
 through the 'load_tmpl' method.
 .
 This package also bundles in the CGI::Application::Plugin::TT::LastModified
 module, which adds support for setting a "Last-Modified" header based on the
 most recent modification time of all the components of a template that
 was processed with TT.
