Description: module for compiling .cgi scripts to a code reference
 CGI::Compile is an utility to compile CGI scripts into a code reference that
 can run many times on its own namespace, as long as the script is ready to
 run on a persistent environment.
 .
 NOTE: for best results, load CGI::Compile before any modules used by your
 CGIs.
 .
 Combined with CGI::Emulate::PSGI, your CGI script can be turned into a
 persistent PSGI application.
