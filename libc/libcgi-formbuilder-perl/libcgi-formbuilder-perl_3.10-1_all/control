Description: Easily generate and process stateful CGI forms
 CGI::FormBuilder is a Perl module for generating, processing, and validating
 CGI forms. It's an extremely fast and robust module with a ridiculous set of
 features.
 .
 Highlights:
 .
  * DWIMmery
 FormBuilder tries to do what you mean. Tell it the fields you care
 about, and it takes care of all the stupid HTML and JavaScript
 generation and processing for you. It also gives you back the correct
 values that you want. It will even label your fields automatically with
 human-readable names.
 .
  * Input field abstraction
 Simply define your fields and their options, and FormBuilder will
 take care of figuring out what the best HTML representation is. It will
 then generate the appropriate input fields (text, select, radio, etc),
 even changing any JavaScript actions appropriately.
 .
  * Easy handling of defaults
 Just specify a hash of values to use as the defaults for your fields.
 This will be searched case-insensitively and displayed in the form.
 What's more, if the user enters something via the CGI that overrides a
 default, when you use the field() method to get the data you'll get the
 correct value.
 .
  * Correct stickiness
 Stickiness is a PITA. FormBuilder correctly handles even multiple
 values selected in a multiple select list, completely integrated with
 proper handling of defaults.
 .
  * Robust field validation
 Form validation sucks, and this is where FormBuilder is a big help. It
 has tons of builtin patterns, and will even generate gobs of JavaScript
 validation code for you. It is possible to specify your own regexps as well,
 and FormBuilder will even check multivalued select lists correctly.
 .
  * Multiple submit mode support
 FormBuilder allows one to reliably tell whether the person clicked on
 the "Update" or "Delete" button of your form, normally a big pain.
 .
  * Template driver support
 FormBuilder can natively "drive" several major templating engines:
  * HTML::Template
  * CGI::FastTemplate
  * Text::Template
  * Template Toolkit
 FormBuilder can help building a complete form application with a template in
 less that 20 lines of Perl.
 .
  * Internationalized, Customizable Messaging
 FormBuilder allows customization of every single message that ot outputs for
 given locale.
 .
  * Simple Interface
 The author has specialized in User Interface Design.
 .
  * Extensive Documentation
