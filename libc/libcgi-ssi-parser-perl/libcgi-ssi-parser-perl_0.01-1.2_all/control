Description: used in CGI scripts for parsing SSI directives
 in files or string variables, and fully implements
 the functionality of apache's mod_include module.
 .
 It is an alternative to famous Apache::SSI modules, but it
 doesn't require mod_perl. This is an advantage to those who are
 using public hosting services. There is a disadvantage, however
 - the module consumes much memory, and I don't recommend using
 it on heavy-loaded sites (currently it's being used on a site
 with 10000 hits, and I consider this as a limit). I hope to get
 rid of this disadvantage by the time the release comes out
 (currently it's beta).
