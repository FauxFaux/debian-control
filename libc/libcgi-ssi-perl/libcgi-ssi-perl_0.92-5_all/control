Description: Perl module to use SSI from CGI scripts
 CGI::SSI is meant to be used as an easy way to filter shtml through CGI
 scripts in a loose imitation of Apache's mod_include. If you're using
 Apache, you may want to use either mod_include or the Apache::SSI module
 instead of CGI::SSI. Limitations in a CGI script's knowledge of how the
 server behaves make some SSI directives impossible to imitate from a CGI
 script.
