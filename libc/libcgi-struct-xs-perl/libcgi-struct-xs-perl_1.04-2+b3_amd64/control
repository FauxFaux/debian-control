Description: Perl module to build structures from CGI data, XS version
 CGI::Struct::XS is the XS implementation of CGI::Struct, a module for
 transforming CGI GET/POST data into intricate data structures. This is
 reminiscent of PHP's building arrays from form data, but with a perl
 twist.
 .
 CGI::Struct::XS is fully compatible with CGI::Struct, except for error
 messages. At the same time, it is 3-15 (5-25 with dclone disabled) times
 faster than original module.
