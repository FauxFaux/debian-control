Description: CGI::Untaint input handler for date validation
 CGI::Untaint::date is an input handler for CGI::Untaint that verifies that it
 is dealing with a reasonable date. Reasonably means anything that Date::Manip
 thinks is sensible, so you could use any of (for example): "December 12,
 2001" "12th December, 2001" "2001-12-12" "next Tuesday" "third Wednesday in
 March".
