Description: module to process CGI input parameters
 Dealing with large web based applications with multiple forms is a
 minefield. It's often hard enough to ensure you validate all your
 input at all, without having to worry about doing it in a consistent
 manner. If any of the validation rules change, you often have to alter
 them in many different places. And, if you want to operate taint-safe,
 then you're just adding even more headaches.
 .
 CGI::Untaint provides a simple, convenient, abstracted and extensible
 manner for validating and untainting the input from web forms.
 .
 You simply create a handler with a hash of your parameters (usually
 $q->Vars), and then iterate over the fields you wish to extract,
 performing whatever validations you choose. The resulting variable is
 guaranteed not only to be valid, but also untainted.
