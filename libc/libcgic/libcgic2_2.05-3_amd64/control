Description: C library for developing CGI applications
 Cgic is an ANSI-C library for the creation of CGI-based World Wide Web
 applications.  Cgic provides the following:
 .
   * Parses form data, correcting for defective and/or inconsistent
     browsers
   * Transparently accepts both GET and POST form data
   * Handles line breaks in form fields in a consistent manner
   * Provides string, integer, floating-point, and single- and
     multiple-choice functions to retrieve form data
   * Provides bounds checking for numeric fields
   * Loads CGI environment variables into C strings which are always
     non-null
   * Provides a way to capture CGI situations for replay in a debugging
     environment
 .
 This package provides a shared library version of cgic.
