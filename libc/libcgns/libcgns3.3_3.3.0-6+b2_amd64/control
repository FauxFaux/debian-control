Description: CFD General Notation System library
 The CFD General Notation System (CGNS) provides a general, portable, and
 extensible standard for the storage and retrieval of computational fluid
 dynamics (CFD) analysis data. It consists of a collection of conventions, and
 free and open software implementing those conventions. It is self-descriptive,
 machine-independent, well-documented, and administered by an international
 steering committee. It is also an American Institute of Aeronautics and
 Astronautics (AIAA) Recommended Practice.
