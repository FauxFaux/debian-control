Description: universal charset detection library - shared library
 libchardet is based on Mozilla Universal Charset Detector library and
 detects the character set used to encode data.
 .
 The original code was written by Netscape for the Mozilla Browser.
 Later, the code was turned into the Encode::Detect Perl module, known
 in Debian as libencode-detect-perl. This library switches the Perl
 wrapper API, to form a C library with a libtool build environment.
 .
 This package provides the shared libraries needed to run
 programs using libchardet.
