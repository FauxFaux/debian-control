Description: clone of the classic Eliza program
 Chatbot::Eliza implements the classic Eliza algorithm. The original Eliza
 program was written by Joseph Weizenbaum and described in the Communications
 of the ACM in 1966. Eliza is a mock Rogerian psychotherapist. It prompts for
 user input, and uses a simple transformation algorithm to change user input
 into a follow-up question. The program is designed to give the appearance of
 understanding.
 .
 This program is a faithful implementation of the program described by
 Weizenbaum. It uses a simplified script language (devised by Charles Hayden).
 The content of the script is the same as Weizenbaum's.
