Description: IP addresses and netblocks manipulation library
 libcidr is a C library implementing a variety of functions to
 manipulate IP addresses and netblocks. It handles both IPv4 and IPv6
 networks, will transform them to and from text strings in a variety of
 formats, cram them into and lever them out of in_addr and in6_addr
 structures, and give you all sorts of stats about them.
 Functions are provided also to tell you a few things about the network
 any given CIDR block is in, what its parent and child networks are, and
 so on. If you're really nice, may even cook you breakfast.
 .
 This package contains include files and development documentation.
