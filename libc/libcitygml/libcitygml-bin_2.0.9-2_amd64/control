Description: Utils of libcitygml - citygmltest
 libcitygml is a small and easy to use open source C++ library for parsing
 CityGML files in such a way that data can be easily exploited by 3D
 rendering applications (geometry data are tesselated and optimized for
 rendering during parsing). For instance, it can be used to develop readers
 of CityGML files in many 3D based applications (OpenGL, OpenSceneGraph, ...)
 Most metadata are not lost, they are available through a per-node hashmap.
 .
 CityGML (City Geography Markup Language) is an XML-based schema for the
 modelling and exchange of georeferenced 3D city and landscape models that
 is quickly being adopted on an international level.
 .
 This package contains the citygmltest utility.
