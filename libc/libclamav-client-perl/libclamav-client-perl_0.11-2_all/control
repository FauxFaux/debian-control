Description: Perl client for the ClamAV virus scanner daemon
 This package supplies ClamAV::Client, a Perl interface to
 the ClamAV virus scanner via the clamd daemon.  It allows
 connection either over a UNIX domain socket to a local
 clamd, via TCP to a remote one.
 .
 The client package fully implements the clamd socket protocol,
 with both scanning and daemon management calls provided.
