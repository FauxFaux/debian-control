Description: anti-virus utility for Unix - unrar support
 Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for Unix. The main purpose of
 this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
 scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable
 multi-threaded daemon in the clamav-daemon package, a command-line
 scanner in the clamav package, and a tool for automatic updating via
 the Internet in the clamav-freshclam package. The programs are based
 on libclamav7, which can be used by other software.
 .
 This package provides support for RAR packaged files or mail attachments.
 Support will be available once this package is installed and clamd or a local
 clamscan is restarted.
