Description: Perl module providing minimalist, fast accessors
 Class::Accessor::Classy provides an extremely small-footprint accessor/mutator
 declaration scheme for fast and convenient object attribute setup. Its intent
 is to be a simple and speedy mechanism for preventing hash-key typos rather
 than a full-blown object system with type checking and so on.
 .
 The accessor ('foo') and mutator ('set_foo') methods appear as a hidden parent
 class of your package and stay out of your way otherwise.
