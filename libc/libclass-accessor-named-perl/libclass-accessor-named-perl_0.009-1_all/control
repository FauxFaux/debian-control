Description: module to better profiling output for Class::Accessor
 Class::Accessor is a great way to automate the tedious task of generating
 accessors and mutators. One small drawback is that due to the details of
 the implemenetation, you only get one __ANON__ entry in profiling output.
 That entry contains all your accessors, which can be a real pain if you're
 attempting to figure out which of your accessors is being called six billion
 times.
 .
 Class::Accessor::Named is a development aid which uses Hook::LexWrap and
 Sub::Name to talk your accessors into identifying themselves. While it
 shouldn't add much additional runtime overhead (as it acts only
 Class::Accessor's generator functions), it has not been designed for
 production deployment.
