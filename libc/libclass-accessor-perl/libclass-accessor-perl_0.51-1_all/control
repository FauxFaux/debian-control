Description: Perl module that automatically generates accessors
 Class::Accessor automagically generates accessor/mutator methods for your
 class. Most of the time, writing accessors is an exercise in cutting and
 pasting. If you make your module a subclass of Class::Accessor and declare
 your accessor fields with mk_accessors() then you will find yourself with a
 set of automatically generated accessors which can even be customized.
