Description: module managing conflict between AUTOLOAD, can and inheritance
 Class::AutoloadCAN solves a fundamental conflict between AUTOLOAD, can and
 inheritance. The problem is that while you can implement anything in
 AUTOLOAD, UNIVERSAL::can is not aware that it is there. Attempting to modify
 UNIVERSAL::can to document those methods is very hard. And if a parent class
 uses AUTOLOAD then subclasses have to do a lot of work to make their
 AUTOLOADs cooperate with the parent one. It is harder still if 2 parent
 classes in a multiple inheritance tree wish to cooperate with each other. Few
 try to do this, which may be good since those who try usually get it wrong.
 See http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=342804 for a fuller discussion.
 .
 With this module instead of writing AUTOLOADs, you write CANs. Based on what
 they return, Class::AutoloadCAN will decide whether you handle the call or it
 needs to search higher up the inheritance chain.
