Description: module for deferring loading ('use'ing) of a class until run time
 Class::Autouse allows you to specify a class the will only load when a
 method of the class is called. For large classes that might not be used
 during the running of a program, such as Date::Manip, this can save
 you large amounts of memory, and decrease the script load time.
