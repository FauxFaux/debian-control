Description: drop-in replacement for NEXT, using Class::C3 to do the hard work
 Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT is intended as a drop-in replacement for NEXT,
 supporting the same interface, but using Class::C3 to do the hard work. You
 can then write new code without NEXT, and migrate individual source files to
 use Class::C3 or method modifiers as appropriate, at whatever pace you're
 comfortable with.
