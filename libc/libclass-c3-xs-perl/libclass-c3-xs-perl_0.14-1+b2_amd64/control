Description: Perl module to accelerate Class::C3
 Class::C3::XS is a Perl module designed to enhance the performance of the
 Class::C3 package (see libclass-c3-perl). It does so automatically and is not
 designed to be used directly; once installed, it should accelerate all programs
 that make use of Class::C3 itself.
