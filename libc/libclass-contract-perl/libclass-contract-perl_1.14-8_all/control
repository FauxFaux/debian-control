Description: Perl Design-by-Contract OO module
 The Class::Contract module implements strong encapsulation, static
 inheritance, and design-by-contract condition checking for object-oriented
 Perl. The module provides a declarative syntax for attribute, method,
 constructor, and destructor definitions at both the object and class level.
 Pre-conditions, post-conditions, and class invariants are also fully
 supported.
