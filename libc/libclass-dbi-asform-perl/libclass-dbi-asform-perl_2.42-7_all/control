Description: module to produce HTML form elements for database columns using Class::DBI
 The Class::DBI::AsForm module helps to generate HTML forms for creating new
 database rows or editing existing rows. It maps column names in a database
 table to HTML form elements which fit the schema. Large text fields
 are turned into textareas, and fields with a has-a relationship to
 other Class::DBI tables are turned into select drop-downs populated
 with objects from the joined class.
