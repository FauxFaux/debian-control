Description: Perl module to update Class::DBI data using CGI::Untaint
 Lots of times, Class::DBI is used in web-based applications. (In
 fact, coupled with a templating system that allows you to pass
 objects, such as Template::Toolkit, Class::DBI is very much your
 friend for these.)
 .
 One of the most irritating things about writing web-based applications
 is the monotony of writing much of the same stuff over and over again.
 And, where there's monotony there's a tendency to skip over stuff that
 is really important, but is a pain to write - like Taint Checking and
 sensible input validation. (Especially as you can still show a 'working'
 application without it!). CGI::Untaint can take care of a lot of that
 for us.
 .
 It so happens that CGI::Untaint also plays well with Class::DBI. All
 you need to do is to 'use Class::DBI::FromCGI' in your class (or in
 your local Class::DBI subclass that all your other classes inherit
 from. You do that, don't you?).
