Description: Perl module to make static calls apply to a default instantiation
 Class::Default provides a mechanism to allow your class to take static method
 calls and apply it to a default instantiation of an object. It provides a
 flexibility to an API that allows it to be used more comfortably in
 different situations.
 .
 This technique appears to be especially useful when writing modules that you
 want to be used in either a single use or a persistent environment. In a CGI
 like environment, you want the simplicity of a static interface. You can
 call Class->method directly, without having to pass an instantiation
 around constantly.
