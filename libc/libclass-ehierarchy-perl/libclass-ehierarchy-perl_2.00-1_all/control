Description: module that provides a base class for hierarchally ordered objects
 Class::EHierarchy is intended for use as a base class for custom objects, but
 objects that need one or more of the following features: orderly bottom-up
 destruction of objects, opaque objects, class-based access restrictions for
 properties and methods, primitive strict property type awareness, alias-based
 object retrieval.
