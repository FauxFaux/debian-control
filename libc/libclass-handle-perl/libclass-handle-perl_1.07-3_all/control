Description: module to create objects which are handles to classes
 Class::Handle is a Perl module that attempts to provide a convenient object
 wrapper around the various different types of functions that can be performed
 on a class. It provides what is effectively a combined API from UNIVERSAL,
 Class::ISA and Class::Inspector for obtaining information about a class, and
 some additional task methods.
