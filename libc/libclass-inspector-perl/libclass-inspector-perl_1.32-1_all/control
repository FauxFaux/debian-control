Description: Perl module that provides information about classes
 Class::Inspector allows you to get information about a loaded class.
 Most or all of this information can be found in other ways, but they
 aren't always very friendly, and usually involve a relatively high level
 of Perl wizardry, or strange and unusual looking code. Class::Inspector
 attempts to provide an easier, more friendly interface to this
 information.
