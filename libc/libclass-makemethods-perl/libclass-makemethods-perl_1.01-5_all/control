Description: Perl module for generating common types of methods
 The Class::MakeMethods framework allows Perl class developers to
 quickly define common types of methods. When a module uses
 Class::MakeMethods or one of its subclasses, it can select from a
 variety of supported method types, and specify a name for each method
 desired. The methods are dynamically generated and installed in the
 calling package.
