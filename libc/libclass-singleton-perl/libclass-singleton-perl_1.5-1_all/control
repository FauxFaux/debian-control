Description: implementation of a "Singleton" class
 The Class::Singleton module implements a Singleton class from which other
 classes can be derived.  A Singleton describes an object class that can have
 only one instance in any system.  An example of a Singleton might be a print
 spooler or system registry.
 .
 By itself, the Class::Singleton module does very little other than manage the
 instantiation of a single object.  In deriving a class from Class::Singleton,
 your module will inherit the Singleton instantiation method and can implement
 whatever specific functionality is required.
 .
 For a description and discussion of the Singleton class, see
