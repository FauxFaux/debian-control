Description: module for creating standard "inside-out" classes
 Class::Std is a Perl module that provides tools to implement the "inside out
 object" class structure in a convenient and standardized way. This approach,
 which is also known as flyweight scalars, warehoused attributes and inverted
 indices, is discussed further in the documentation for this package.
