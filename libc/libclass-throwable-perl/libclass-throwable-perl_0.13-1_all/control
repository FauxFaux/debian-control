Description: minimal lightweight exception class
 Class::Throwable implements a minimal lightweight exception object. It is
 meant to be a compromise between more basic solutions like Carp which can
 only print information and cannot handle exception objects, and more
 complex solutions like Exception::Class which can be used to define
 complex inline exceptions and has a number of module dependencies.
