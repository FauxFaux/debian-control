Description: Implementation of Traits in Perl
 Traits are a simple composition mechanism for structuring
 object-oriented programs. A Trait is essentially a parameterized set of
 methods, which serves as a building block for classes and is the primitive
 unit of code reuse. Unlike mixins and multiple inheritance, Traits do not
 use inheritance as the composition operator. Instead, Trait composition
 is based on a set of operators that are  complementary to single
 inheritance and result in better composition properties.
 .
 Traits are a core part of Perl 6 (called Roles there), and Class::Trait
 implements traits for Perl 5.
