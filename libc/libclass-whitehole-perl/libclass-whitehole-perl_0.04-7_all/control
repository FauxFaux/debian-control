Description: base class to treat unhandled method calls as errors
 It is possible to accidentally inherit an AUTOLOAD method. Often this
 will happen if a class somewhere in the chain uses AutoLoader or
 defines one of their own. This can lead to confusing error messages
 when method lookups fail.
 .
 Sometimes you want to avoid this accidental inheritance. In that
 case, inherit from Class::WhiteHole. All unhandled methods will
 produce normal Perl error messages.
