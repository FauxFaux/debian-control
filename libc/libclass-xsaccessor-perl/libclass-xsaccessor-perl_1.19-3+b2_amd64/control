Description: Perl module providing fast XS accessors
 Class::XSAccessor implements fast XS accessors both for getting at and setting
 an object attribute. Additionally, the module supports mutators and simple
 predicates like those for testing the truth value of a variable. It works only
 with objects that are implemented as ordinary hashes.
 .
 The XS accessor methods were between 1.6 and 2.5 times faster than typical
 pure-perl accessors in some simple benchmarking. If you usually write clear
 code, a factor of two speed-up is a good estimate.
 .
 Refer to Class::XSAccessor::Array (also included in libclass-xsaccessor-perl)
 for an implementation that works with array-based objects.
