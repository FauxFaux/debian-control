Description: language parser library
 Libcleri is a powerful tool to build languages. From a built language,
 libcleri can automatically create parse trees, which are data structures
 representing how a grammar matches input. It also provides feedback in case
 the input does not match the language. This can be useful for auto-completion,
 suggestions or error handling.
