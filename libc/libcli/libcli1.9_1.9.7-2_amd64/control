Description: emulates a cisco style telnet command-line interface
 libcli provides a consistent Cisco style command-line environment for
 remote clients, with a few common features between every implemtation.
 .
 The library is not accessed by itself, rather the software which uses
 it listens on a defined port for a Telnet connection. This connection
 is handed off to libcli for processing.
 .
 libcli includes support for command history, command line editing and
 filtering of command output.
