Description: unified Python interface into the cloud (Python3 version)
 libcloud is a pure Python client library for interacting with many of the
 popular cloud server providers using a unified API. It was created to make it
 easy for developers to build products that work between any of the services
 that it supports.
 .
  * Avoid vendor lock-in

  * More than 30 supported providers total
  * Four main APIs: Compute, Storage, Load Balancers, DNS
