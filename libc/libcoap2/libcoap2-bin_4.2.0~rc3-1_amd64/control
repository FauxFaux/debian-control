Description: C-Implementation of CoAP - example binaries API version 2
 The libcoap provides some example binary files to show the usage of a CoAP
 Server, CoAP Client and a Resource Directory implementation. These examples
 heavily rely on the libcoap as the core functionality is based there.
 .
 This package provides the following example binaries without DTLS functions:
  * coap-client
    A command-line client that allows you to interact with CoAP reasources.
 .
  * coap-server
    Simple server that can provide CoAP resources for simple testing cases.
 .
  * coap-rd
    This binary let you simulate various CoAP resources mostly for testing
    purpose.
 .
 This package providesthe following example binaries with DTLS functions:
  * coap-client-openssl
    A command-line client that allows you to interact with CoAP reasources
    based on TLS functions by OpenSSL.
 .
  * coap-server-openssl
    Simple server that can provide CoAP resources for simple testing cases
    based on TLS functions by OpenSSL.
 .
  * coap-rd-openssl
    This binary let you simulate various CoAP resources mostly for testing
    purpose based on TLS functions by OpenSSL.
 .
 You can use these files without any exception no matter as they named
 examples. Please see the respectives man pages for usage instructions.
