Description: your all-in-one code tidier and validator
 There are a lot of great code tidiers and validators out there. tidyall
 makes them available from a single unified interface.
 .
 You can run tidyall on a single file or on an entire project hierarchy,
 and configure which tidiers/validators are applied to which files.
 tidyall will back up files beforehand, and for efficiency will only
 consider files that have changed since they were last processed.
 .
 This package provides commandline tool tidyall and Perl module
 Code::TidyAll.
 .
 Includes hooks for git and subversion, and plugin for php-codesniffer,
 requiring corresponding packages installed.
