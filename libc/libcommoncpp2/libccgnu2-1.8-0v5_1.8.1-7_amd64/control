Description: GNU package for creating portable C++ programs
 Common C++ "2" is a GNU package which offers portable "abstraction"
 of system services such as threads, networks, and sockets.  Common
 C++ also offers individual frameworks generally useful to developing
 portable C++ applications including a object persistence engine, math
 libraries, threading, sockets, etc.  Common C++ is small, and highly
 portable.  Common C++ will support most Unix operating systems as
 well as Win32, in addition to GNU/Linux.
 .
 This package contains the runtime libraries.
