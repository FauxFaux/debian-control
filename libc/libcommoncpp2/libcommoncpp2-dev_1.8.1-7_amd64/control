Description: Header files and static libraries for Common C++ "2"
 Common C++ is a GNU package which offers portable "abstraction" of system
 services such as threads, networks, and sockets.  Common C++ also offers
 individual frameworks generally useful to developing portable C++
 applications including a object persistence engine, math libraries,
 threading, sockets, etc.  Common C++ is small, and highly portable.
 Common C++ will support most Unix operating systems as well
 as Win32, in addition to GNU/Linux.
