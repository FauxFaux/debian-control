Description: File upload capability to your servlets and web applications
 The Commons FileUpload package makes it easy to add robust, high-performance,
 file upload capability to your servlets and web applications.
 .
 FileUpload parses HTTP requests which conform to RFC 1867, "Form-based File
 Upload in HTML". That is, if an HTTP request is submitted using the POST
 method, and with a content type of "multipart/form-data", then FileUpload
 can parse that request, and make the results available in a manner easily
 used by the caller.
