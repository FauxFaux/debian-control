Description: Apache Commons Launcher - Cross platform Java application launcher
 Commons-launcher eliminates the need for a batch or shell script to
 launch a Java class. Some situations where elimination of a batch or
 shell script may be desirable are:
 .
  * You want to avoid having to determining where certain application
    paths are e.g. your application's home directory, etc. Determining this
    dynamically in a Windows batch scripts is very tricky on some versions
    of Windows or when softlinks are used on Unix platforms.
 .
  * You want to avoid having to handle native file and path separators
    or native path quoting issues.
 .
  * You need to enforce certain system properties
    e.g. java.endorsed.dirs when running with JDK 1.4.
 .
  * You want to allow users to pass in custom JVM arguments or system
    properties without having to parse and reorder arguments in your
    script. This can be tricky and/or messy in batch and shell scripts.
 .
  * You want to bootstrap system properties from a configuration file
    instead hard-coding them in your batch and shell scripts.
 .
  * You want to provide localized error messages which is very tricky
    to do in batch and shell scripts.
