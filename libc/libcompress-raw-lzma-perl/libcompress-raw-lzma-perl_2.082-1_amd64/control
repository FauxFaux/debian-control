Description: low-level interface to lzma compression library
 Compress::Raw::Lzma provides a low-level Perl interface for reading and
 writing of lzma and xz files/buffers.
 .
 Although the primary purpose for the existence of Compress::Raw::Lzma is for
 use by the IO::Compress::Lzma, IO::Uncompress::UnLzma, IO::Compress::Xz and
 IO::Uncompress::UnXz modules (packaged as libio-compress-lzma-perl), it can
 be used on its own for simple compression/uncompression tasks.
