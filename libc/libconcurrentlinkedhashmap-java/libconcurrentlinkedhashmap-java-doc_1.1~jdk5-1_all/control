Description: Documentation for libconcurrentlinkedhashmap-java
 Documentation for concurrentlinkedhashmap that is a
 Java library that provides a hash table supporting full
 concurrency of retrievals, adjustable expected
 concurrency for updates, and a maximum capacity to bound
 the map by. This implementation differs from
 java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap in that it
 maintains a page replacement algorithm that is
 used to evict an entry when the map has exceeded its
 capacity. Unlike the Java Collections Framework, this
 map does not have a publicly visible constructor and
 instances are created through a Builder.
