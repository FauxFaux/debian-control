Description: grammar-based user-friendly config parser
 Config::Grammar is a module to parse configuration files. The configuration
 may consist of multiple-level sections with assignments and tabular data. The
 parsed data will be returned as a hash containing the whole configuration.
 Config::Grammar uses a grammar that is supplied upon creation of a
 Config::Grammar object to parse the configuration file and return helpful
 error messages in case of syntax errors. Using the makepod method you can
 generate documentation of the configuration file format.
 .
 The maketmpl method can generate a template configuration file. If your
 grammar contains regexp matches, the template will not be all that helpful as
 Config::Grammar is not smart enough to give you sensible template data based
 in regular expressions. The related function maketmplmin generates a minimal
 configuration template without examples, regexps or comments and thus allows
 an experienced user to fill in the configuration data more efficiently.
