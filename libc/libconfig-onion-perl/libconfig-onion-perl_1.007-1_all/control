Description: layered configuration
 Config::Onion stores all configuration settings in four layers:
 Defaults, Main, Local, and Override. Each layer can be added to as many
 times as you like. Within each layer, settings which are given multiple
 times will take the last specified value, while those which are not
 repeated will remain untouched.
