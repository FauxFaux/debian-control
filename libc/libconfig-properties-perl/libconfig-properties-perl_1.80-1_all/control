Description: Perl module to read and write Java-style property files
 Config::Properties is a near implementation of the java.util.Properties API.
 It is designed to allow easy reading, writing and manipulation of Java-style
 property files in Perl applications.
 .
 The format of a Java-style property file is that of a key-value pair
 separated by either whitespace, the colon (:) character, or the equals (=)
 character. Whitespace before the key and on either side of the separator is
 ignored. Lines that begin with either a hash (#) or a bang (!) are considered
 comment lines and ignored.
