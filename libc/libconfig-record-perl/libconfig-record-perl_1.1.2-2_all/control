Description: Perl module for configuration file access
 Config::Record provides an API for loading and saving of simple configuration
 file records. Entries in the configuration file are essentially key, value
 pairs, with the key and values separated by a single equals symbol. The key
 consists only of alphanumeric characters. There are three types of values:
 scalar values, array values and hash values.
