Description: Load and save configuration files in a standard format
 Config::Std implements yet another damn configuration-file system.
 .
 The configuration language is deliberately simple and limited, and the
 module works hard to preserve as much information (section order,
 comments, etc.) as possible when a configuration file is updated.
