Description: Read/Write .ini style files with as little code as possible
 Config::Tiny is a perl class to read and write .ini style configuration files
 with as little code as possible, reducing load time and memory overhead.
 .
 This module is primarily for reading human written files, and anything
 written into shouldn't need to have documentation/comments. If something with
 more power is needed, move up to Config::Simple, Config::General or one of
 the many other Config:: modules. Config::Tiny does not preserve comments,
 whitespace, or the order of the file contents.
