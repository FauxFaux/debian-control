Description: module for manipulating YAML-based configuration files
 Config::YAML is a somewhat object-oriented wrapper around the YAML module
 designed to make reading and writing configuration files simple. It handles
 multiple configuration files (e.g. system and per-user configuration or a
 gallery application with per-directory configuration) with ease.
