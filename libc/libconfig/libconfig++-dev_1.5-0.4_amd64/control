Description: parsing/manipulation of structured config files (C++ development)
 This library features a fully reentrant parser and includes bindings for
 both the C and C++ programming languages. It runs on modern POSIX-compliant
 systems such as Linux, Solaris, and Mac OS X (Darwin), as well as on
 Microsoft Windows 2000/XP and later (Visual Studio or MinGW).
 .
 This library allows parsing, manipulating and writing structured configuration
 files. Its main features are:
  - A fully reentrant parser: Multiple configurations can be parsed in
    concurrent threads at the same time.
  - A simple, structured configuration file format: more readable and compact
    than XML and more flexible than Windows' "INI" file format.
  - A low-footprint implementation
  - Proper documentation.
 .
 This package contains the files needed in order to use libconfig
 in your own C++ programs.
