Description: Perl interface to the uulib library (a.k.a. uudeview/uuenview)
 Convert::UUlib is a versatile and powerful decoder/encoder library
 for a variety of encodings used in Usenet and Mail (uuencode,
 xxencode, b64, binhex...).
 .
 The library contains a variety of heuristics to reliably decode
 any files found in the input files, whether part of a single
 mail folder or spread over hundreds of files. Its two-pass
 architecture makes it possible to decode hundreds of megabytes in
 one sweep, without using much virtual memory.
