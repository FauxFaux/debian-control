Description: common library for searching CPAN modules, authors, and distributions
 CPAN::Common::Index provides a common library for working with a variety of
 CPAN index services. It is intentionally minimalist, trying to use as few
 non-core modules as possible.
 .
 CPAN::Common::Index is an abstract base class that defines a common API.
 Individual backends deliver the API for a particular index.
