Description: module to extract distribution name and version from a filename
 CPAN::DistnameInfo is a Perl module that extracts the name and version from a
 CPAN distribution name. It uses heuristics similar to those used by the main
 <URL:https://metacpan.org/> site to extract the distribution information.
 It also reports if the version is to be treated as a developer release.
