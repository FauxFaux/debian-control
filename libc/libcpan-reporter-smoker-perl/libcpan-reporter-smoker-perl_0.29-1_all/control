Description: turnkey CPAN Testers smoking module
 Rudimentary smoke tester for CPAN Testers, built upon CPAN::Reporter. Use at
 your own risk. It requires a recent version of CPAN::Reporter to run.
 .
 Currently, CPAN::Reporter::Smoker requires zero independent configuration;
 instead it uses configuration settings from CPAN.pm and CPAN::Reporter.
 .
 Once started, it retrieves a list of distributions from the configured CPAN
 mirror and begins testing them in reverse order of upload. It will skip any
 distribution which has already had a report sent by CPAN::Reporter.
 .
 Features:
  * No configuration needed
  * Tests each distribution as a separate CPAN process -- each distribution
    has prerequisites like build_requires satisfied from scratch
  * Automatically checks for new distributions every twelve hours or as
    otherwise specified
  * Continues until interrupted with CTRL-C
  * Checks CPAN.pm "distroprefs" to see if distributions should be skipped
    (before handing off to CPAN)
