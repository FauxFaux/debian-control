Description: module to upload packages to the CPAN
 CPAN::Uploader is a Perl module which allows developers to upload their
 modules and packages to the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) via
 the [Perl programming] Authors Upload Server (more commonly known as PAUSE).
 .
 It provides a direct programmatic interface via a singleton class, but also
 includes a command-line utility called `cpan-upload' to do the same.
