Description: module to manage flow of control in Continuation Passing Style
 CPS is a Perl module that enables developers to write code in Continuation
 Passing Style, which is a style of writing code where the normal call/return
 mechanism is replaced by explicit "continuations". It is useful whenever some
 form of asynchronous or event-based programming is in use.
