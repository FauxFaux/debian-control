Description: assigns a set of CPUs and Memory Nodes to a set of tasks
 The Cpuset System is a processor and memory placement mechanism that
 enables a system administrator to confine tasks to running on
 certain CPUs, and to allocating memory on certain Memory Nodes.
 The libcpuset library provides a convenient 'C' API to cpusets.
