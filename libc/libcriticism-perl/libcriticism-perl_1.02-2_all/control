Description: Perl pragma to enforce coding standards and best-practices
 The cristicism pragma enforces coding standards and promotes best-practices
 by running your file through Perl::Critic before every execution. In a
 production system, this usually isn't feasible because it adds a lot of
 overhead at start-up. If you have a separate development environment,
 you can effectively bypass the "criticism" pragma by not installing
 Perl::Critic in the production environment. If Perl::Critic can't be
 loaded, then "criticism" just fails silently.
