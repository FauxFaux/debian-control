Description: Triple-DES EDE encryption/decryption for perl
 Crypt::DES_EDE3 implements DES-EDE3 encryption. This is triple-DES
 encryption where an encrypt operation is encrypt-decrypt-encrypt, and
 decrypt is decrypt-encrypt-decrypt. This implementation uses Crypt::DES
 to do its dirty DES work, and simply provides a wrapper around that
 module: setting up the individual DES ciphers, initializing the keys,
 and performing the encryption/decryption steps.
 .
 You're probably best off not using this module directly, as the encrypt
 and decrypt methods expect 8-octet blocks. You might want to use the
 module in conjunction with Crypt::CBC, for example. This would be
 DES-EDE3-CBC, or triple-DES in outer CBC mode.
