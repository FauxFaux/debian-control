Description: Diffie-Hellman key exchange system implemented in Perl
 Diffie-Hellman is an algorithm by which two parties can agree on a
 shared secret key, known only to them. The secret is negotiated over an
 insecure network without the two parties ever passing the actual shared
 secret, or their private keys, between them.
