Description: Perl extension for one way hash chaining encryption using SHA
 This module implements a chaining block cipher using a one way hash. This
 method of encryption is the same that is used by radius (RFC2138) and is also
 described in Applied Cryptography.
 .
 Two interfaces are provided in the module. The first is straight block
 encryption/decryption the second does base64 mime encoding/decoding of the
 encrypted/decrypted blocks.
 .
 The idea is that the two sides have a shared secret that supplies one of the
 keys and a randomly generated block of bytes provides the second key. The
 random key is passed in cleartext between the two sides.
 .
 An example client and server are packaged as modules with this module. They
 are used in the tests. They can be found in the examples directory.
