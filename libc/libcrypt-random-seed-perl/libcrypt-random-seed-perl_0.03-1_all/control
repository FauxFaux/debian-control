Description: Perl module providing strong randomness for seeding
 Crypt::Random::Seed implements a simple mechanism to get strong
 randomness. The main purpose of this module is to provide a simple way
 to generate a seed for a PRNG such as Math::Random::ISAAC, for use in
 cryptographic key generation, or as the seed for an upstream module
 such as Bytes::Random::Secure. Flags for requiring non-blocking sources
 are allowed, as well as a very simple method for plugging in a source.
