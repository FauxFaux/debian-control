Description: Perl library to encrypt stuff simply
 Maybe you have a web application and you need to store some session
 data at the client side (in a cookie or hidden form fields) but you
 don't want the user to be able to mess with the data. Maybe you want
 to save secret information to a text file.  Maybe you have better
 ideas of what to do with encrypted stuff!
 .
 The Crypt::Simple module will convert all your data into nice base64 text
 that you can save in a text file, send in an email, store in a cookie
 or web page, or bounce around the Net. The data you encrypt can be as
 simple or as complicated as you like.
