Description: generate LM/NT hash of a password for samba
 Crypt::SmbHash provides functions to generate LM/NT hashes
 used in Samba's 'smbpasswd' file.
 .
 The module is a direct port of code from Samba and is written
 entirely in perl, so it is slower than a C implementation but it
 is easily ported and installed.
