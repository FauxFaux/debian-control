Description: Cubesat Space Protocol Library
 Cubesat Space Protocol (CSP) is a small protocol stack written in C. CSP is
 designed to ease communication between distributed embedded systems in smaller
 networks, such as Cubesats. The design follows the TCP/IP model and includes a
 transport protocol, a routing protocol and several MAC-layer interfaces. The
 core of libcsp includes a router, a socket buffer pool and a connection
 oriented socket API.
