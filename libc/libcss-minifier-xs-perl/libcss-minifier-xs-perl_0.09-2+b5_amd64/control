Description: XS based CSS minifier
 CSS::Minifier::XS is a CSS "minifier"; its designed to remove un-necessary
 whitespace and comments from CSS files, while also not breaking the CSS.
 .
 CSS::Minifier::XS is similar in function to CSS::Minifier, but is
 substantially faster as its written in XS and not just pure Perl.
