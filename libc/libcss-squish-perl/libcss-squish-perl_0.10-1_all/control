Description: module to compact many CSS files into one big file
 CSS::Squish is a Perl module that takes a list of CSS files and concatenates
 them, honouring any valid @import statements included in the files, following
 the CSS 2.1 specification. Media-specific @import statements will be honoured
 by enclosing the included file in a @media rule.
 .
 Future versions may include methods to compact whitespace and other parts of
 the CSS itself, but this functionality is not yet supported.
