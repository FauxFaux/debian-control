Description: Perl module to read/write .css files with as little code as possible
 CSS::Tiny is a perl class to read and write .css stylesheets with as
 little code as possible, reducing load time and memory overhead.
 CSS.pm requires about 2.6M of memory to load, which is a large amount of
 overhead if you only want to do trivial things.
 .
 This module is primarily for reading and writing simple files, and anything
 you write shouldn't need to have documentation/comments. If you need something
 with more power, move up to CSS.pm.
