Description: library for flexible control files, documentation
 libctl is a free Guile-based library implementing flexible control files for
 scientific simulations. It was written to support the MIT Photonic-Bands
 program, but will hopefully prove useful in other programs too.
 .
 This package contains the documentation in HTML format and a simple example of
 how to use it.
