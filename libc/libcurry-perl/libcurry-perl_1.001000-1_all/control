Description: module to create automatic curried method call closures for any class or object
 The curry module provides a function that simplifies the creation of curried
 method closures which are functions that wrap an existing function and
 provide some of the inner functions arguments. It also contains a package
 variable which, in addition, weakens the wrapper function so it is will not
 hold a reference count for the inner function so Perl's garbage collection
 system can destroy the latter when needed.
