Description: curses-based OO user interface framework for Perl
 A UI framework for Perl based on the curses library.  Curses::UI contains
 the standard set of widgets for use in constructing user interfaces, plus
 the following more advanced widgets: calendar, progress bar, text editor
 (including word wrapping and undo), and text viewer.  It supports a
 variety of dialog windows, from the standard basic and error dialogs to
 file browsers, progress bars, and a calendar.  Curses::UI also has
 internationalization support and currently has localization information
 for several languages.
