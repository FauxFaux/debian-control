Description: Development files for libcypher-parser
 Cypher is a graph query language that allows for expressive and efficient
 querying of graph data.
 .
 libcypher-parser provides efficient parsing of Cypher into an Abstract
 Syntax Tree (AST) form, using a parsing expression grammar that is equivalent
 to that used in the Neo4j graph database.
 .
 This package contains the development files (headers, static libraries).
