Description: Documentation for libcypher-parser
 Cypher is a graph query language that allows for expressive and efficient
 querying of graph data.
 .
 libcypher-parser provides efficient parsing of Cypher into an Abstract
 Syntax Tree (AST) form, using a parsing expression grammar that is equivalent
 to that used in the Neo4j graph database.
 .
 This package contains the documentation that is also available on the
 libcypher-parser website (https://github.com/cleishm/libcypher-parser).
