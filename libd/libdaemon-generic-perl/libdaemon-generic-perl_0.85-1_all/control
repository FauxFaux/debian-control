Description: framework to provide start/stop/reload for a daemon
 Daemon::Generic provides a framework for starting, stopping and reconfiguring
 daemon-like programs. The framework provides for standard commands that work
 for init.d files and as apachectl-like commands.
 .
 Programs that use Daemon::Generic subclass Daemon::Generic to override its
 behavior. Almost everything that Generic::Daemon does can be overridden as
 needed.
