Description: effortless web application framework
 Dancer is a Perl web application framework that aims to provide the simplest
 way for writing web applications, and offers the flexibility to scale between
 a very simple lightweight web service consisting of a few lines of code in a
 single file, all the way up to a more complex fully-fledged web application
 with session support, templates for views and layouts, etc.
 .
 If you don't want to write CGI scripts by hand, and find other frameworks
 such as Catalyst (see libcatalyst-perl) too complex or cumbersome for your
 project, Dancer is what you need.
