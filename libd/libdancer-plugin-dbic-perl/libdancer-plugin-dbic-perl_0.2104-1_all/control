Description: DBIx::Class interface for Dancer applications
 Dancer is a Perl web application framework.
 .
 Dancer::Plugin::DBIC provides an easy way to obtain
 DBIx::Class::ResultSet instances via the function schema(), which it
 automatically imports.  You just need to point to a dsn in your Dancer
 configuration file.  So you no longer have to write boilerplate DBIC
 setup code.
