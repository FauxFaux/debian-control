Description: Dancer plugin to display temporary, so called "flash messages"
 Dancer::Plugin::FlashMessage helps you display temporary messages, also known
 as "flash messages". Flash messages can be used to inform the user that a
 certain operation was successful in way that doesn't take space when there
 are no messages to be shown.
 .
 The plugin provides a flash() method for setting the message and takes care
 of attaching the content to the session, propagating it to the templating
 system, and then removing it from the session.
 .
 The developer's only remaining job is to provide a place in the views or the
 layout where the message will be displayed.
 .
 Dancer is a lightweight yet powerful web application framework.
