Description: module for easy database connections for Dancer2 applications
 Dancer2::Plugin::Database Provides an easy way to obtain a connected DBI
 database handle by simply calling the database keyword within your Dancer2
 application
 .
 The module returns a Dancer::Plugin::Database::Core::Handle object, which is
 a subclass of DBI's `DBI::db' connection handle object, so it does everything
 you'd expect to do with DBI, but also adds a few convenience methods.
 .
 It takes care of ensuring that the database handle is still connected and
 valid. If the handle was last asked for more than
 `connection_check_threshold' seconds ago, it will check that the connection
 is still alive, using either the `$dbh->ping' method if the DBD driver
 supports it, or performing a simple no-op query against the database if not.
 If the connection has gone away, a new connection will be obtained and
 returned. This avoids any problems for a long-running script where the
 connection to the database might go away.
 .
 Care is taken that handles are not shared across processes/threads, so this
 should be thread-safe with no issues with transactions etc.
