Description: Server library for the Network Data Access Protocol
 OPeNDAP provides software that allows you to access data over the internet,
 from programs that weren't originally designed for that purpose, as well
 as some that were. While OPeNDAP is the original developer of the Data Access
 protocol which its software uses, many other groups have adopted DAP
 and provide compatible clients, servers and software development kits.
