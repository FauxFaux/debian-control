Description: Read/write buffer class for perl
 Data::Buffer implements a low-level binary buffer in which you can get
 and put integers, strings, and other data. Internally the implementation
 is based on pack and unpack, such that Data::Buffer is really a layer
 on top of those built-in functions.
