Description: Perl module for polymorphic data cloning
 Data::Clone does data cloning, i.e. copies things recursively. This is smart
 so that it works with not only non-blessed references, but also with blessed
 references (i.e. objects). When clone() finds an object, it calls a clone
 method of the object if the object has a clone, otherwise it makes a surface
 copy of the object. That is, this module does polymorphic data cloning.
 .
 Although there are several modules on CPAN which can clone data, this module
 has a different cloning policy from almost all of them.
