Description: Perl module that dumps Perl data structures as Perl code
 Data::Dmp is a Perl dumper like Data::Dumper. It's compact (only about 150
 lines of code long), starts fast and does not use other module except
 Regexp::Stringify when dumping regexes. It produces compact output (similar
 to Data::Dumper::Concise). It roughly has the same speed as Data::Dumper
 (usually a bit faster for smaller structures), but does not offer the various
 formatting options. It supports dumping objects, regexes, circular
 structures, coderefs. Its code is based on Data::Dump.
