Description: Perl module that dumps data structures as single-line strings
 Data::Dump::OneLine dumps data structures as single-line strings. It uses
 Data::Dmp.
 .
 JSON should also encode to a single-line string, but some data structures
 (cyclical, contains globs or other special Perl data) cannot be encoded out of
 the box to JSON.
 .
 Data::Dumper::OneLine strives to do the same for Data::Dumper.
