Description: module for serializing a data structure as Perl code
 Data::Dump::Streamer is a Perl module that serializes scalars, objects or
 reference variables and provides their contents in Perl syntax. Special data
 structures including closures, self-referential structures and objects are
 output correctly. This module is very similar in concept to the core module
 Data::Dumper, except this module is designed to output to a stream instead
 of constructing its output in memory (trading speed for memory).
