Description: module for more shorter Data::Dumper-like output
 Data::Dumper::Concise is a Perl module designed to produce useful debugging
 output, eliding unnecessary information. It exists as a convenient way to
 reproduce a set of Dumper options useful for most applications.
 .
 A similar module, Data::Dump::Streamer (libdata-dump-streamer-perl) provides
 even shorter output but is overkill for most applications. In comparison,
 this module is Pure Perl, which means it is less likely to segfault.
