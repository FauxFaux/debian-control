Description: Easily dump variables together with their names (Data::Dumper-like)
 Data::Dumper::Simple allows the user to dump variables in a Data::Dumper
 format. Unlike the default behavior of Data::Dumper, the variables are named
 (instead of $VAR1, $VAR2, etc.)  Data::Dumper provides an extended
 interface that allows the programmer to name the variables, but this
 interface requires a lot of typing and is prone to tyops (sic).  This
 module fixes that.
