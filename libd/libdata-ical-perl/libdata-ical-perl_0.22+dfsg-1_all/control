Description: Perl module for manipulating iCalendar (RFC2445) files
 Data::ICal provides an implementation of Perl objects that represent a given
 VCALENDAR object as defined in the iCalendar protocol (RFC 2445, MIME type
 "text/calendar"), as implemented in many popular calendaring programs such as
 Apple's iCal.
 .
 Each Data::ICal object is a collection of "entries", which are objects of a
 subclass of Data::ICal::Entry. The types of entries defined by iCalendar
 (which refers to them as "components") include events, to-do items, journal
 entries, free/busy time indicators and time zone descriptors, but this module
 currently only implements to-do items and events.
