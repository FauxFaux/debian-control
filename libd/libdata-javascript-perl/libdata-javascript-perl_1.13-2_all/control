Description: dump perl data structures into JavaScript code
 Data::JavaScript is mainly inteded for CGI programming, when a perl script
 generates a page with client side JavaScript code that needs access to
 structures created on the server.
 .
 It works by creating one line of JavaScript code per datum. Therefore,
 structures cannot be created anonymously and need to be assigned to
 variables. However, this format enables dumping large structures.
