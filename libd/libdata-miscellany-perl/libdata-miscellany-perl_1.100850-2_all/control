Description: collection of miscellaneous subroutines
 Data::Miscellany is a collection of miscellaneous subroutines useful in wide
 but varying scenarios; a catch-all module for things that don't obviously
 belong anywhere else.
 .
 Obviously, what's considered useful differs from person to person, but this
 particular collection should be useful in object-oriented frameworks, such
 as Class::Framework and Data::Conveyor.
