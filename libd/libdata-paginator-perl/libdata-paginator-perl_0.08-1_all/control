Description: pagination module for Moose
 Data::Paginator is yet another pagination module. It only exists because none
 of the other pager modules are written using Moose. Sometimes there is a Moose
 feature that you need. It's a pain when you can't use it with an existing
 module.
 .
 Data::Paginator aims to be completely compatible with the venerable
 Data::Page.
