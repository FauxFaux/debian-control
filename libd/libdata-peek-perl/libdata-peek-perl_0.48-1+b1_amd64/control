Description: module providing low-level manipulation of Perl data
 Data::Peek is a module that allows for low-level manipulation of Perl data
 structures, particularly for displaying the internal representation of given
 Perl variables.
 .
 In particular, it allows one to look at a scalar value to determine whether it
 contains a string (PV), integer (IV or UV) or floating point number (NV); the
 reference count of that scalar (REFCOUNT) and other flags (such as whether the
 string is UTF-8).
 .
 This module can also create triple variables, which are similar to the dual
 variables provided by Scalar::Util - they have two or three values, and the
 value which is returned depends on the context in which it is used.
