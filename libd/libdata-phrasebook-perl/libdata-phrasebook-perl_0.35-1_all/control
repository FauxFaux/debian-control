Description: perl implementation of the phrasebook paradigm
 The phrasebook pattern is a technique to separate expressions in one language
 (e.g. SQL) from the main code that is written in another (e.g. Perl). The
 translations are kept in a separate file - the phrasebook.
 .
 Data::Phrasebook enables the framework for abstracting common or locale data
 out of your code into a datastore. The default is within a plain text file,
 but more complex datastores can be intrigrated via the use of other
 Data::Pharsebook::Loader distributions (eg YAML, XML, INI, DBI).
