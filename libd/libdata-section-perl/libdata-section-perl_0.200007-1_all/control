Description: module to read chunks of data from a module's DATA section
 Data::Section is a Perl module that provides an easy way to access multiple
 named chunks of line-oriented data in your module's DATA section. It was
 written to allow modules to store their own templates, but is probably useful
 for other purposes as well.
