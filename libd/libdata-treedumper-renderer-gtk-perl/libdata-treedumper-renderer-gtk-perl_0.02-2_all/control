Description: Gtk2::TreeView renderer for Data::TreeDumper
 The Data::TreeDumper::Renderer::GTK widget is the GUI equivalent of
 Data::TreeDumper; it will display a perl data structure in a TreeView,
 allowing you to fold and unfold child data structures and get a quick feel
 for what's where. Right-clicking anywhere in the view brings up a context
 menu, from which the user can choose to expand or collapse all items.
