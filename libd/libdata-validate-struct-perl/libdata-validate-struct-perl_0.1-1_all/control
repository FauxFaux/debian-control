Description: module to validate recursive hash structures
 Data::Validate::Struct validates a hash reference against a given hash
 structure. This is in contrast to Data::Validate in which you have to check
 each value separately.
 .
 The hash could be the result of a config parser or just any hash structure.
 E.g. the hash returned by XML::Simple could be validated using this module.
 You may also use it to validate CGI input; just fetch the input data from
 CGI, map it to a hash and validate it.
