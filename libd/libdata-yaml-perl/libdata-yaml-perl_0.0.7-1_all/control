Description: Easy YAML serialisation of Perl data structures
 In the spirit of YAML::Tiny, Data::YAML::Reader and Data::YAML::Writer
 provide lightweight, dependency-free YAML handling. While YAML::Tiny is
 designed principally for working with configuration files Data::YAML
 concentrates on the transparent round-tripping of YAML serialized Perl data
 structures.
 .
 As an example of why this distinction matters consider that YAML::Tiny
 doesn't handle hashes with keys containing non-printable characters. This is
 fine for configuration files but likely to cause problems when handling
 arbitrary Perl data structures. Data::YAML handles exotic hash keys
 correctly.
 .
 The syntax accepted by Data::YAML is a subset of YAML. Specifically it is the
 same subset of YAML that Data::YAML::Writer produces. See Data::YAML for more
 information.
