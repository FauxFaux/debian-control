Description: module to extract probable dates from strings
 Date::Extract extracts dates from arbitrary strings. It will take an
 arbitrary block of text, search it for something that looks like a date
 string, and build a DateTime object out of it.
 .
 By design it will produce few false positives. This means it will not catch
 nearly everything that looks like a date string. So if you have the string
 "do homework for class 2019" it won't return a DateTime object with the year
 set to 2019.
