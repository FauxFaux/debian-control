Description: Perl module for Gregorian calendar date calculations
 This package consists of a Perl module for all kinds of date calculations
 based on the Gregorian calendar (the one used in all western countries today),
 thereby complying with all relevant norms and standards: ISO/R 2015-1971, DIN
 1355 and, to some extent, ISO 8601 (where applicable).
 .
 Date::Pcalc is a direct translation of Steffen Beyer's excellent Date::Calc
 module to Perl.
