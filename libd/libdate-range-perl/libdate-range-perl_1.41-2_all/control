Description: work with a range of dates
 Quite often, when dealing with dates, we don't just want to know information
 about one particular date, but about a range of dates. For example, we may
 wish to know whether a given date is in a particular range, or what the
 overlap is between one range and another. Date::Range lets you ask such
 questions.
