Description: Programs for double-array trie library
 Trie is a kind of digital search tree, an efficient indexing method in which
 search time is independent of database size. It only takes O(m) search time,
 where m is the length of the search string. Comparably as efficient as
 hashing, trie also provides flexibility on incremental matching and key
 spelling manipulation. This makes it ideal for lexical analyzers, as well as
 spelling dictionaries.
 .
 This library is an implementation of double-array structure for representing
 trie, as proposed by Junichi Aoe. The details of the implementation can be
 found at https://linux.thai.net/~thep/datrie/datrie.html
 .
 This package contains the program files which is used with the library,
 including trietool, the trie manipulation tool.
