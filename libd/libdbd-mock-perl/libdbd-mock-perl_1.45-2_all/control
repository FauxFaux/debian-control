Description: Mock database driver for testing
 Testing with databases can be tricky. If you are developing a system married
 to a single database then you can make some assumptions about your
 environment and ask the user to provide relevant connection information. But
 if you need to test a framework that uses DBI, particularly a framework that
 uses different types of persistence schemes, then it may be more useful to
 simply verify what the framework is trying to do -- ensure the right SQL is
 generated and that the correct parameters are bound. DBD::Mock makes it easy
 to just modify your configuration (presumably held outside your code) and
 just use it instead of DBD::Foo (like DBD::Pg or DBD::mysql) in your
 framework.
