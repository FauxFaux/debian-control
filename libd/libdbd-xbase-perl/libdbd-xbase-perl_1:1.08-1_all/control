Description: Perl module to access xbase files (optionally through DBI)
 DBD::XBase allows creation, access and modification of .dbf (dBase,
 Clipper, Fox* style) database files. It is capable of handling memo
 files, but indexes only in a somewhat limited way. It has two
 interfaces: one using SQL commands (through DBI) ad the other with a
 simple OO interface.
 .
 You can use the included dbf_dump program to dump the content of a .dbf file.
