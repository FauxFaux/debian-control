Description: test suite for the DBI API
 DBI::Test aims to be a test suite for the DBI API and an underlying DBD
 driver, to check if the provided functionality is working and complete.
 .
 Part of this module is the ability for self-testing using DBI::Mock. This is
 not designed to be another DBI::PurePerl - it's designed to allow tests can
 be verified to work as expected in a sandbox. This is, of course, limited to
 DBI API itself and cannot load any driver nor really execute any action.
