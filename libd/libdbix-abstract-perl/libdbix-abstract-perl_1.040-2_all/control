Description: DBI SQL abstraction
 DBIX::Abstract provides methods for retrieving and storing data in SQL
 databases.  It provides methods for all of the more important SQL
 commands (like SELECT, INSERT, REPLACE, UPDATE, DELETE).
 .
 It endeavors to produce an interface that will be intuitive to those
 already familiar with SQL.
 .
 Notable features include:
  * data_source generation for some DBD drivers.
  * Can check to make sure the connection is not stale and reconnect if
    it is.
  * Controls statement handles for you.
  * Can delay writes.
  * Generates complex where clauses from hashes and arrays.
  * Shortcuts (convenience functions) for some common cases.
    (Like select_all_to_hashref.)
