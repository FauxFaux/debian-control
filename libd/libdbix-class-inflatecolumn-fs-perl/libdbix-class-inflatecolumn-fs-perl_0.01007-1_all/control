Description: Inflate/deflate columns to Path::Class::File objects
 DBIx::Class::InflateColumn::FS provides DBIx::Class style column
 inflation to a Path::Class::File object allowing file system storage
 of BLOBS.
 .
 The storage path is specified with fs_column_path. Each file receives a
 unique name, so the storage for all FS columns can share the same path.
 .
 Within the path specified by fs_column_path, files are stored in
 sub-directories based on the first 2 characters of the unique file
 names.
