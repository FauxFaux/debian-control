Description: Introspection of many-to-many DBIx::Class relationships
 Because DBIx::Class many-to-many relationships are not actual relationships,
 they cannot be introspected with DBIx::Class.  They are actually just a
 collection of convenience  methods that bridge two actual relationships.
 .
 DBIx::Class::IntrospectableM2M can be used to store all relevant information
 about these M2M relationships so they can later be introspected and examined.
