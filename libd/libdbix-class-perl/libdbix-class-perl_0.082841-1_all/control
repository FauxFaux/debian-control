Description: extensible and flexible object <-> relational mapper
 DBIx::Class is an SQL to OO mapper with an object API inspired by Class::DBI
 (and a compatibility layer as a springboard for porting) and a resultset API
 that allows abstract encapsulation of database operations. It aims to make
 representing queries in your code as perl-ish as possible while still
 providing access to as many of the capabilities of the database as possible,
 including retrieving related records from multiple tables in a single query,
 JOIN, LEFT JOIN, COUNT, DISTINCT, GROUP BY and HAVING support.
 .
 DBIx::Class can handle multi-column primary and foreign keys, complex queries
 and database-level paging, and does its best to only query the database in
 order to return something you've directly asked for. If a resultset is used
 as an iterator it only fetches rows off the statement handle as requested
 in order to minimise memory usage. It has auto-increment support for SQLite,
 MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server and DB2 and is known to be used in
 production on at least the first four, and is fork- and thread-safe out of
 the box (although your DBD may not be).
