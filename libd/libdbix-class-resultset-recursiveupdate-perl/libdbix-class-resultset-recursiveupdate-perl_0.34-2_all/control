Description: module for recursive updates of DBIx::Class::ResultSets
 You can feed the ->create method of DBIx::Class with a recursive
 datastructure and have the related records created. Unfortunately you cannot
 do a similar thing with update_or_create.
 .
 DBIx::Class::ResultSet::RecursiveUpdate tries to fill that void.
 .
 It is a base class for DBIx::Class::ResultSet providing the method
 recursive_update which works just like update_or_create but can recursively
 update or create result objects composed of multiple rows.
