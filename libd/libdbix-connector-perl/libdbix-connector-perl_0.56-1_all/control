Description: fast and safe DBI connection and transaction management
 DBIx::Connector provides a simple interface for fast and safe DBI
 connection and transaction management. Connecting to a database can be
 expensive; you don't want your application to re-connect every time you
 need to run a query. The efficient thing to do is to hang on to a
 database handle to maintain a connection to the database in order to
 minimize that overhead. DBIx::Connector lets you do that without having
 to worry about dropped or corrupted connections.
