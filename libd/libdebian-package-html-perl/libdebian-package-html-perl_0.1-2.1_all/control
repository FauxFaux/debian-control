Description: generates HTML from a Debian source/binary package
 This module outputs a webpage using HTML::Template templates which
 resumes the information of a normal build environment for a package
 in Debian (source files, binary packages and changelogs) using
 Linda/Lintian for sanity checks. It is useful for making unified presentation
 webpages for those packages which are being sponsorized by someone in Debian.
