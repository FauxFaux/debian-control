Description: XML parser optimized for round-tripping and code reuse
 DecentXML is an XML parser written in Java with following features:
 .
  * Allows 100% round-tripping, even for weird whitespace between attributes in
    the start tag or in the end tag.
  * Suitable for building editors and filters which want/need to preserve the
    original file layout as much as possible.
  * Error messages have line and column information.
  * Easy to reuse individual components.
  * XML 1.1 compatible.
