Description: Perl module which communicates with the Desktop Notifications framework
 This module provides a Perl interface to the Desktop Notifications framework.
 .
 The framework allows applications to display pop-up notifications on an X
 desktop.  This is implemented with two components: a daemon that displays the
 notifications, and a client library used by applications to send notifications
 to the daemon.  These components communicate through the DBus message bus
 protocol.
 .
 This module serves the same purpose as libnotify, in an object-oriented Perl
 interface.  It is not, however, an interface to libnotify itself, but a
 separate implementation of the specification using Net::DBus.
