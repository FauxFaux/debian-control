Description: Object-oriented backtrace
 Devel::Backtrace provides methods for accessing backtrace information, i.e.
 it allows one to see the "route" through a script. It returns short or detailed
 information about backtrace points as strings.
 .
 The included Devel::DollarAt module gives some additional functionality to
 the $@ scalar, i.e. it makes interpreting exceptions easier.
