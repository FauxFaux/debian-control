Description: custom op checking attached to subroutines
 Devel::CallChecker makes some new features of the Perl 5.14.0 C API
 available to XS modules running on older versions of Perl.  The
 features are centred around the function cv_set_call_checker, which
 allows XS code to attach a magical annotation to a Perl subroutine,
 resulting in resolvable calls to that subroutine being mutated at
 compile time by arbitrary C code.  This module makes
 cv_set_call_checker and several supporting functions available.  (It is
 possible to achieve the effect of cv_set_call_checker from XS code on
 much earlier Perl versions, but it is painful to achieve without the
 centralised facility.)
