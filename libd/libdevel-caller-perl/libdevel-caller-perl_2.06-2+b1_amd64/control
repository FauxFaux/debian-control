Description: module providing enhanced caller() support
 Devel::Caller is a Perl module that provides several useful functions for
 introspecting your code deeper than the internal function "caller()" does. It
 allows you to access arguments passed to a function or even retrieve the code
 reference of the subroutine being invoked at the call frame indicated by the
 given level.
