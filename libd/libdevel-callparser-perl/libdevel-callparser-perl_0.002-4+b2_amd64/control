Description: custom parsing attached to subroutines
 Devel::CallParser provides a C API, for XS modules, concerned with
 custom parsing.  It is centred around the function cv_set_call_parser,
 which allows XS code to attach a magical annotation to a Perl
 subroutine, resulting in resolvable calls to that subroutine having
 their arguments parsed by arbitrary C code.  (This is a more
 conveniently structured facility than the core's PL_keyword_plugin
 API.)  This module makes cv_set_call_parser and several supporting
 functions available.
