Description: Code tracer to follow function calls
 There are a number of perl modules in the CPAN that are designed to
 trace a program's execution as it runs. Each uses a different trick to
 do its job, fulfilling different needs. The technique Devel::Calltrace
 uses is quite simple and seems to be quite robust.
