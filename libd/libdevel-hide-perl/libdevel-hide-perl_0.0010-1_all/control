Description: module for forcing the unavailability of specified Perl modules (for testing)
 Given a list of Perl modules/filenames, Devel::Hide makes require and use
 statements fail (no matter the specified files/modules are installed or not).
 .
 They die with a message like:
 .
 Can't locate Module/ToHide.pm (hidden)
 .
 The original intent of Devel::Hide is to allow Perl developers to test for
 alternative behavior when some modules are not available. In a Perl
 installation, where many modules are already installed, there is a chance to
 screw things up because you take for granted things that may not be there in
 other machines.
