Description: Perl module to dump subroutine parameters concisely
 Devel::PartialDump is similar in nature to Data::Dumper, however, it is
 optimized for the common case of bug reporting with complex data structures.
 Outputting a string containing a complex data structure can yield rather
 useless results, since the structures are stringified.
 .
 This module optionally overrides Carp's routines to provide a concise dump of
 a variable's contents instead of a simple stringification with warn, etc.
