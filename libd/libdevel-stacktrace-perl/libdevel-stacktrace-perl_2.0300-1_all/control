Description: Perl module containing stack trace and related objects
 The Devel::StackTrace module contains two classes, Devel::StackTrace
 and Devel::StackTraceFrame.  The goal of this object is to encapsulate
 the information that can found through using the caller() function, as
 well as providing a simple interface to this data.
 .
 The Devel::StackTrace object contains a set of Devel::StackTraceFrame
 objects, one for each level of the stack. The frames contain all the
 data available from caller().
