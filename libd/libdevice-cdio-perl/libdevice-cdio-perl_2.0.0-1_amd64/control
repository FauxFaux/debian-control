Description: CD Input and control library
 Device::Cdio is an interface to the GNU CD Input and Control library (libcdio)
 and its ISO 9660 library (libiso9660) which are written in C. The library
 encapsulates CD-ROM reading and control and ISO 9660 handling. Perl programs
 wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and device-dependent properties of a
 CD-ROM can use this library.
