Description: Perl Implementation of Rivest's MD5 algorithm
 Digest::Perl::MD5s has the same interface as the much faster Digest::MD5, but
 unlike that, it is not an interface but a Perl implementation of MD5. Because
 of this it is slow but it works without C-Code. You should use Digest::MD5
 instead of this module if it is available. This module is only useful for
 .
  - computers where you cannot install Digest::MD5 (e.g. lack of a C-Compiler)
  - encrypting only small amounts of data (less than one million bytes),
    e.g. hashing passwords
  - educational purposes
