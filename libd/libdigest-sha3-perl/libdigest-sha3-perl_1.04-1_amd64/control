Description: Perl extension for SHA-3
 Digest::SHA3 is a complete implementation of the NIST SHA-3
 cryptographic hash function, known originally as Keccak. It gives Perl
 programmers a convenient way to calculate SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384,
 and SHA3-512 message digests, as well as variable-length hashes using
 SHAKE128 and SHAKE256. The module can handle all types of input,
 including partial-byte data.
