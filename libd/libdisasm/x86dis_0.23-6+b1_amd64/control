Description: Frontend to libdisasm
 Libdisasm is a disassembler for Intel x86-compatible object code. It compiles
 as a shared and static library on Linux, FreeBSD, and Win32 platforms. The
 core disassembly engine is contained in files with the prefix "i386", and is
 shared with the x86 ARCH extension of the bastard disassembler.
 .
 This package contains the x86dis command-line frontend.
