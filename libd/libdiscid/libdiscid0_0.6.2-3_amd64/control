Description: library for creating MusicBrainz DiscIDs
 libdiscid is a library for creating MusicBrainz DiscIDs from audio CDs.
 It reads a CD's table of contents (TOC) and generates an identifier which
 can be used to lookup the CD at MusicBrainz (http://musicbrainz.org).
 Additionally, it provides a submission URL for adding the DiscID to the
 database.
