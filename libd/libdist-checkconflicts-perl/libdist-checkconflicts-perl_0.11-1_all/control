Description: module for declaring version conflicts for a distribution
 One shortcoming of the CPAN clients that currently exist is that they have no
 way of specifying conflicting downstream dependencies of modules.
 Dist::CheckConflicts attempts to work around this issue by allowing you to
 specify conflicting versions of modules separately, and deal with them after
 the module is done installing.
 .
 For instance, say you have a module Foo, and some other module Bar uses Foo.
 If Foo were to change its API in a non-backwards-compatible way, this would
 cause Bar to break until it is updated to use the new API. Foo can't just
 depend on the fixed version of Bar, because this will cause a circular
 dependency (because Bar is already depending on Foo), and this doesn't
 express intent properly anyway - Foo doesn't use Bar at all. The ideal
 solution would be for there to be a way to specify conflicting versions of
 modules in a way that would let CPAN clients update conflicting modules
 automatically after an existing module is upgraded, but until that happens,
 this module will allow users to do this manually.
