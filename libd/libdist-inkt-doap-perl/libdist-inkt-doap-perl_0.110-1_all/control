Description: various DOAP-related roles for Dist::Inkt
 Dist::Inkt is a framework for writing your own distribution builder.
 It's a simple class that makes an empty directory, creates a MANIFEST
 file listing the contents of the directory, and then compresses it into
 a tarball.
 .
 Which seems pretty useless. However, it provides tonnes of hooks that
 can be used by roles applied to the class. Dist::Inkt::DOAP provides a
 collection of roles that help you populate the distribution's metadata
 (META.json, Changes, etc) from DOAP.
