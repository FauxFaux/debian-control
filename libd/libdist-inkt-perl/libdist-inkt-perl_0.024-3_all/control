Description: yet another distribution builder
 Dist::Inkt itself does virtually nothing; it creates an empty
 directory, generates a MANIFEST file, and then wraps it all up into a
 gzipped tarball.  But it provides various hooks along the way for
 subclasses to grab hold of.  So the general idea is that you write a
 subclass of Dist::Inkt, which consumes various Moose::Roles to do the
 actual work of populating the distribution with files.
 .
 As such, Dist::Inkt is not so much a distribution builder, as it is a
 framework for writing your own distribution builder.
 .
 Several roles of varying utility are bundled with Dist::Inkt, as is
 Dist::Inkt::Profile::Simple, a subclass of Dist::Inkt which consumes
 most of these roles.
