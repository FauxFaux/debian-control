Description: module for getting information about a perl module distribution
 Dist::Metadata provides an easy interface for getting various metadata about
 a Perl module distribution.
 .
 This is mostly a wrapper around CPAN::Meta providing an easy interface to
 find and load the meta file from a tar.gz file. A dist can also be
 represented by a directory or merely a structure of data.
 .
 If the dist does not contain a meta file the module will attempt to determine
 some of that data from the dist.
