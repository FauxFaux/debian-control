Description: Run Devel::Cover from within Dist::Zilla
 Dist::Zilla::App::Command::cover is a command plugin for
 Dist::Zilla. It provides the dzil subcommand "cover", which generates
 code coverage metrics for your Dist:Zilla based distribution using
 Devel::Cover.
 .
 If there were any test errors, the cover command won't be run. Author
 and release tests are not run since they should not be counted
 against code coverage. Any additional command-line arguments are
 passed to Devel::Cover's cover command.
