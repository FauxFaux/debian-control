Description: Dist::Zilla plugin for checking presence of command at build time
 Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckBin is a Dist::Zilla plugin that modifies
 the Makefile.PL or Build.PL in a distribution to contain a
 Devel::CheckBin call which asserts that a particular command is
 available.  If it is not available, the program exits with a status
 of zero, which on a CPAN Testers machine will result in a NA result.
 .
 This provides an alternative to Dist::Zilla::Plugin::RequiresExternal
 which instead creates a unit test for the presence of a command and
 so is interpreted as a package failure or bug instead of incorrectly
 installed.
