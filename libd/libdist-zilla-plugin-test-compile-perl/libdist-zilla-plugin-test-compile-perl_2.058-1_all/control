Description: common tests to check syntax of your modules, using only core modules
 Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Compile is a Dist::Zilla plugin that runs
 at the gather files (Dist::Zilla::Role::FileGatherer) stage, and
 creates a test for correct perl file compilation only dependent on
 core modules.
 .
 This test finds all modules and scripts in your distribution and try
 to compile them one by one. This means it's a bit slower than loading
 them all at once but it will catch more errors.
