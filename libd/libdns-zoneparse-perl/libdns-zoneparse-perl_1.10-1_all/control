Description: Perl extension for parsing and manipulating DNS Zone Files
 DNS::ZoneParse will parse a Zone File and put all the Resource Records (RRs)
 into an anonymous hash structure. At the moment, the following types of RRs
 are supported: SOA, NS, MX, A, CNAME, TXT, PTR. It could be useful for
 maintaining DNS zones, or for transferring DNS zones to other servers. If you
 want to generate an XML-friendly version of your zone files, it is easy to
 use XML::Simple with this module once you have parsed the zonefile.
 .
 DNS::ZoneParse scans the DNS zonefile - removes comments and seperates
 the file into its constituent records. It then parses each record and
 stores the records internally.
