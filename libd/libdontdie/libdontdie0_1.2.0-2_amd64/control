Description: library that sets the TCP keep-alive flag when applications call socket(2)
 libdontdie is a shared library that can be injected into  any  application
 with the LD_PRELOAD mechanism.
 It is completely transparent to the application and therefore works equally
 well with closed-source programs and with languages like Java that do not
 natively allow changing the TCP keep-alive parameters.
