Description: development files for libaldmb1
 DUMB is a tracker library with support for IT, XM, S3M and MOD files. It
 targets maximum accuracy to the original formats, with low-pass resonant
 filters for the IT files, accurate timing and pitching, and three resampling
 quality settings (aliasing, linear interpolation and cubic interpolation).
 .
 This package contains the header files and static library needed to
 compile applications that use libaldmb1.
