Description: dynamic universal music bibliotheque, Allegro version
 DUMB is a tracker library with support for IT, XM, S3M and MOD files. It
 targets maximum accuracy to the original formats, with low-pass resonant
 filters for the IT files, accurate timing and pitching, and three resampling
 quality settings (aliasing, linear interpolation and cubic interpolation).
 .
 This package contains the libaldmb1 runtime library, a library for module
 playback that uses the Allegro library. If you do not plan to use Allegro
 with your project, please consider the libdumb1 library.
