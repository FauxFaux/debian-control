Description: deconstructed dynamic C library loading
 DynaLoader::Functions provides a function-based interface to dynamic
 loading as used by Perl.  Some details of dynamic loading are very
 platform-dependent, so correct use of these functions requires the
 programmer to be mindful of the space of platform variations.
