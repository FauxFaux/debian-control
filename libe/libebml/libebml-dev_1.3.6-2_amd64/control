Description: access library for the EBML format (development files)
 The libebml library allows one to read and write files using EBML (the
 Extensible Binary Meta Language), a binary pendant to XML. Using libebml
 makes it easier to extend a file format without breaking support in
 older parsers.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static libraries needed to
 compile applications that use libebml.
