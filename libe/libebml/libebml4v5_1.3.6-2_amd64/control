Description: access library for the EBML format (shared library)
 The libebml library allows one to read and write files using EBML (the
 Extensible Binary Meta Language), a binary pendant to XML. Using libebml
 makes it easier to extend a file format without breaking support in
 older parsers.
 .
 This package contains the shared library needed to run applications that
 use libebml.
