Description: implementation of the EBU R128 loudness standard (development files)
 The European Broadcasting Union Loudness Recommendation (EBU R128) informs
 broadcasters how they can analyze and normalize audio so that each piece of
 audio sounds roughly the same volume to the human ear.
 .
 This C library provides an API which analyzes audio and outputs perceived
 loudness. The results can then be used to normalize volume during playback.
 This is an alternative to ReplayGain.
 .
 Features:
  * Implements M, S and I modes
  * Implements loudness range measurement (EBU - TECH 3342)
  * True peak scanning
  * Supports all samplerates by recalculation of the filter coefficients
 .
 This package contains the development files.
