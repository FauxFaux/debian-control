Description: C++11 DWARF parser
 Libelfin is a from-scratch C++11 library for reading ELF binaries and DWARFv4
 debug information.
 .
 Libelfin implements a syntactic layer for DWARF and ELF, but not a semantic
 layer. Interpreting the information stored in DWARF DIE trees still requires a
 great deal of understanding of DWARF, but libelfin will make sense of the bytes
 for you.
 .
 This package contains the library to parse DWARFv4 debug information.
