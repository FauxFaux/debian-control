Description: Perl module for RFC 2822 address parsing and creation
 Email::Address implements a complete RFC 2822 parser that locates email
 addresses in strings and returns a list of Email::Address objects
 found. Alternatively you may construct objects manually. The goal
 of this software is to be correct, and very very fast.
 .
 This module is deprecated. Its parse() method can cause a denial of service
 attack by taking way too long. It is recommended to instead use (the parse()
 method from) Email::Address::XS, packaged as libemail-address-xs-perl. Cf.
 Email::Address(1) for details.
