Description: Perl library for RFC 5322 address/group parsing and formatting
 Email::Address::XS implements RFC 5322 parser and formatter of email
 addresses and groups. It parses an input string from email headers which
 contain a list of email addresses or a groups of email addresses (like From,
 To, Cc, Bcc, Reply-To, Sender, ...). Also it can generate a string value for
 those headers from a list of email addresses objects.
 .
 Parser and formatter functionality is implemented in XS and uses shared code
 from Dovecot IMAP server.
 .
 It is a drop-in replacement for the Email::Address module.
