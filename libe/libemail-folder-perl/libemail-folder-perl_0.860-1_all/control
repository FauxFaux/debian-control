Description: Perl module to read mail from a folder
 Email::Folder is a Perl module which reads all messages from a folder into
 Email::Simple objects (see libemail-simple-perl for more), making them easy
 to manipulate from Perl. It becomes fairly trivial to extract information
 from headers in your mail, or change them to different values. As a result,
 this provides a general purpose mail handling facility.
