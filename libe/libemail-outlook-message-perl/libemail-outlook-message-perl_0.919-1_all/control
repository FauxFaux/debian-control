Description: module for reading Outlook .msg files
 Email::Outlook::Message reads e-mail messages stored as .msg files (such as
 generated by Microsoft Outlook), and converts them to Email::MIME objects.
 .
 Not all data in the .msg file is converted.  The meaning of some parts hasn't
 been worked out, while other parts do not make sense outside of Outlook and
 Exchange.
 .
 Currently GPG signed mail is not processed correctly and neither are
 attachments of type 'appledoublefile'.
 .
 The package also contains the tool "msgconvert" (known from
 http://www.matijs.net/software/msgconv/) to convert Microsoft Outlook
 ".msg" files directly on the commandline without having to know how
 to program in Perl.
