Description: Enhanced Metafile library (executable)
 libEMF is a C/C++ library which provides a drawing toolkit based on
 ECMA-234.  The general purpose of this library is to create vector
 graphics files on POSIX systems which can be imported into
 OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice. Times have changed, though.  These
 days, you can import SVGs, or even PDFs, into OpenOffice or
 LibreOffice.  Those are much better choices than EMF files.
 .
 This package contains a tiny executable exposing some of libEMF's
 capabilities to the command line.
