Description: x86 shellcode detection and emulation
 libemu is a small library written in C offering basic x86 emulation and
 shellcode detection using GetPC heuristics.  Intended use is within network
 intrusion/prevention detections and honeypots.
 .
 libemu supports:
   * executing x86 instructions
     * reading x86 binary code
     * register emulation
     * basic FPU emulation
   * shellcode execution
     * shellcode detection
       * using GetPC heuristics
       * static analysis
       * and binary backwards traversal
      * Win32 API hooking
 .
 Using libemu one can:
   * detect shellcodes
   * execute the shellcodes
   * profile shellcode behaviour
 .
 This package has the development files.
