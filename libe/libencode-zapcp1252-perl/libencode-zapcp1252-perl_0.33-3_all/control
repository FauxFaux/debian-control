Description: zap Windows Western gremlin characters
 CP1252 (Windows Western) is a superset of ISO8859-1 (Latin-1).
 Accidentally mixing CP1252 with ISO8859-1 is common, causing "gremlins"
 - broken misfit characters.
 .
 Encode::ZapCP1252 detects freak characters and either transliterates
 them into ASCII counterparts or translates them to UTF-8 equivalents.
 .
 Processed strings are assumed to contain a mixture of ASCII, ISO8859-1
 and CP1252, but no actual UTF-8 characters (even if encoded as such).
 For string soups including UTF-8 characters, Encoding::FixLatin may be
 better suitable.
