Description: takes mixed encoding input and produces UTF-8 output
 Most encoding conversion tools take input in one encoding and produce
 output in another encoding.  Encoding::FixLatin takes input which may
 contain characters in more than one encoding and makes a best effort to
 convert them all to UTF-8 output.
 .
 For string soups containing only ASCII, ISO8859-1 and CP1252 but no
 actual UTF-8 characters (even if encoded as such), Encode::ZapCP1252
 may be better suitable.
 .
 Includes command-line tool fix_latin.
