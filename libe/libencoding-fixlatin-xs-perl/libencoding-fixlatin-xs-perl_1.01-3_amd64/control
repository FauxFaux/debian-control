Description: XS implementation layer for Encoding::FixLatin
 Most encoding conversion tools take input in one encoding and produce
 output in another encoding.  Encoding::FixLatin takes input which may
 contain characters in more than one encoding and makes a best effort to
 convert them all to UTF-8 output.
 .
 Encoding::FixLatin::XS provides a C implementation of the 'fix_latin'
 algorithm.  It is not meant to be called directly.  Instead, simply
 install this module and use Encoding::FixLatin as normal.
 Encoding::FixLatin will use this module if it's found and will fall
 back to the pure-Perl implementation otherwise.
