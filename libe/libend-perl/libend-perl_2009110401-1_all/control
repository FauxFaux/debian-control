Description: Perl interface to execute code at end of scope
 End is a Perl module that exports a single subroutine, end, which enables
 execution of code whenever the current block is exited, regardless of whether
 it is due to a return, next, last, redo, exit, die, goto or just reaching the
 end of the current block.
