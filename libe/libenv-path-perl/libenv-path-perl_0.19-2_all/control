Description: Perl module implementing advanced operations on path variables
 Env::Path presents an object-oriented interface to path variables, defined
 as that subclass of environment variables which name an ordered list of
 filesystem elements separated by a platform-standard separator.
 .
 Env::Path is for cases where you need to insert or remove interior path
 entries, strip redundancies, operate on a path variable without having to
 know whether the current platform uses ":" or ";", operate on a path variable
 which may have a different name on different platforms, etc.
