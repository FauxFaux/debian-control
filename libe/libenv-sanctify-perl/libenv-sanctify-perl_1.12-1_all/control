Description: Perl module providing lexically scoped environment (%ENV)
 Env::Sanctify is a module that provides lexically scoped manipulation and
 sanctification of %ENV. With this module, one can add or alter environment
 variables, later restoring the environment back either manually or
 automatically once the object falls out of scope.
 .
 This is useful for manipulating the environment that forked processes and
 sub-processes will inherit.
