Description: Library for wavelet image compression - development files
 Epsilon is C library for wavelet based lossy image compression.
 Wavelet-driven compressors are know to be much more effective than
 traditional DCT-based ones (like JPEG).
 .
 At the moment, the program supports about 30 different wavelet filters,
 runs in parallel in multi-threaded and MPI environments, can process
 huge images and much more.
 .
 This package contains development stuff.
