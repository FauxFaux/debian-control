Description: Equinox OSGi framework
 This package includes the Eclipse Equinox OSGi framework, which can be used
 outside Eclipse. Equinox is an implementation of the OSGi core framework
 specification, a set of bundles that implement various optional OSGi services
 and other infrastructure for running OSGi-based systems. The Equinox OSGi core
 framework implementation is used as the reference implementation and as such
 it implements all the required features of the latest OSGi core framework
 specification.
 .
 More generally, the goal of the Equinox project is to be a first class OSGi
 community and foster the vision of Eclipse as a landscape of bundles. As part
 of this, it is responsible for developing and delivering the OSGi framework
 implementation used for all of Eclipse.
