Description: LibESMTP SMTP client library
 LibESMTP is a library to manage posting (or submission of) electronic
 mail using SMTP to a preconfigured Mail Transport Agent (MTA) such as
 Exim.  It may be used as part of a Mail User Agent (MUA) or another
 program that must be able to post electronic mail but where mail
 functionality is not the program's primary purpose.
