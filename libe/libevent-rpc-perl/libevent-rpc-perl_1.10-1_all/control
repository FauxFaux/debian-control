Description: Event based transparent Client/Server RPC framework
 Event::RPC supports you in developing Event based networking client/server
 applications with transparent object/method access from the client to the
 server. Network communication is optionally encrypted using IO::Socket::SSL.
 Several event loop managers are supported due to an extensible API. Currently
 Event, Glib and AnyEvent are implemented.
 .
 Event::RPC consists of a server and a client library. The server exports a
 list of classes and methods, which are allowed to be called over the network.
 More specific it acts as a proxy for objects created on the server side (on
 demand of the connected clients) which handles client side methods calls with
 transport of method arguments and return values.
