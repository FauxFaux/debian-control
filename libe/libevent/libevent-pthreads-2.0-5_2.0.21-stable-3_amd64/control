Description: Asynchronous event notification library (pthreads)
 Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that provides a
 mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs
 on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.
 .
 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
 .
 If you want threading support and you're using pthreads, you'll need
 to link against the libevent_pthreads library in addition to
 libevent_core.
