Description: Libevent based HTTP API
 Libevent's http interface was created as a JIT server, never meant to
 be a full-fledged HTTP service.  This library attempts to improve on
 that with the following features:
 .
  + design as a fully functional HTTP server
  + HTTP parser able to process data with a low memory footprint
  + use of regular expressions for routing
  + out-of-the box HTTPS server
 .
 This package contains the runtime library.
