Description: syntactic try/catch sugar for use with Exception::Class
 Exception::Class::TryCatch provides syntactic sugar for use with
 Exception::Class using the familiar keywords try and catch.  Its
 primary objective is to allow users to avoid dealing directly with $@ by
 ensuring that any exceptions caught in an eval are captured as
 Exception::Class objects, whether they were thrown objects to begin with or
 whether the error resulted from die.  This means that users may immediately
 use isa and various Exception::Class methods to process the exception.
 .
 In addition, this module provides for a method to push errors onto a hidden
 error stack immediately after an eval so that cleanup code or other error
 handling may also call eval without the original error in $@ being lost.
