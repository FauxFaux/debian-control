Description: C library for commands execution
 s2argv converts a command string into an argv array for execv, execvp,
 execvpe. execs is like execv taking a string instead of an argv.
 Similarly execsp and execspe are the counterpart of execvp and execvpe,
 respectively, using command strings.
 esystem, system_eexecsp execute a command with its arguments from a string
 without using a shell.
 .
 This is the reduced memory footprint version of libexecs for embedded systems,
 it contains a minimal subset of the functionalities available in the
 main package, in particular the coproc* family of functions,
 system_nosh and popen_nosh are excluded (see the man pages for more info).
