Description: another way of exporting symbols
 Exporter::Tidy serves as an easy, clean alternative to
 Exporter. Unlike Exporter, it is not subclassed, but it simply
 exports a custom import() into your namespace.
 .
 With Exporter::Tidy, you don't need to use any package global
 in your module. Even the subs you export can be lexically scoped.
