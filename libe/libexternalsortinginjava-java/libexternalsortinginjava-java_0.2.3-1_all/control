Description: External-Memory Sorting in Java
 This Java class enables sorting large file without first loading them
 into memory. It is using External Sorting by dividing the files into
 small blocks, sort each block in RAM, and then merge the result.  Many
 database engines and the Unix sort command support external sorting.
 It is possible to sort in a non-lexicographic order.
