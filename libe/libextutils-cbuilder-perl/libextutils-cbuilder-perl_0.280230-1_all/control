Description: module to compile and link C code for Perl modules
 ExtUtils::CBuilder is a utility to portably build C code by invoking the
 appropriate compilers and linkers. It provides a cross-platform way to build
 Perl XS modules, which contain C code that needs to be built and dynamically
 linked to Perl.
 .
 Though motivated by the Module::Build project, it may be useful for other
 purposes as well. However, this module is not intended as a general interface
 for all C building needs.
