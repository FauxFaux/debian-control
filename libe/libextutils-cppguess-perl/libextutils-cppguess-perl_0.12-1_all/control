Description: Perl build helper to guess C++ compiler and flags
 ExtUtils::CppGuess attempts to guess the system's C++ compiler that is
 compatible with the C compiler that your perl was built with.  It can
 generate the necessary options to the Module::Build constructor or to
 ExtUtils::MakeMaker's WriteMakefile function.
