Description: Perl module for building extensions that depend on other extensions
 ExtUtils::Depends tries to make it easy to build Perl extensions that use
 functions and typemaps provided by other perl extensions. This means that a
 perl extension is treated like a shared library that also provides a C and an
 XS interface.
