Description: module to make Build.PL install path logic easy
 ExtUtils::InstallPaths tries to make install path resolution as easy as
 possible.
 .
 When you want to install a module, it needs to figure out where to install
 things. The nutshell version of how this works is that default installation
 locations are determined from ExtUtils::Config, and they may be individually
 overridden by using the install_path attribute. An install_base attribute
 lets you specify an alternative installation root like /home/foo and prefix
 does something similar in a rather different (and more complicated) way.
 destdir lets you specify a temporary installation directory like /tmp/install
 in case you want to create bundled-up installable packages.
