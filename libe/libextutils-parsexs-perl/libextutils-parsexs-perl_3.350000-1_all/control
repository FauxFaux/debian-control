Description: utility to process Perl XS code into C code
 ExtUtils::ParseXS is a Perl utility that provides a modular way of compiling
 Perl XS code into appropriate C code by embedding the constructs necessary to
 let C functions manipulate Perl values and creating the glue necessary to let
 Perl access those functions.
 .
 This module is already included as part of Perl's core distribution, so this
 package is only beneficial when newer features or bug fixes are required.
