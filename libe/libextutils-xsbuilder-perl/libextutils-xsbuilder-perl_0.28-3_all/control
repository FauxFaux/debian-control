Description: Automatic XS glue code generation
 ExtUtils::XSBuilder is a set of modules to parse C header files and
 create XS glue code and documentation from it.
 .
 Ideally this allows you to "write" an interface to a C library
 without coding a line.  Although this module automates much of the
 process, you must still be familiar with C and XS programming since no
 C API is ideal and usually some adjuments are necessary.  When the C
 API changes, most of the time you only have to rerun XSBuilder to get
 your new Perl API.
