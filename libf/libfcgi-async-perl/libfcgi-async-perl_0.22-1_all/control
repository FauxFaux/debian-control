Description: FastCGI engine based on IO::Async
 FCGI::Async is a subclass of Net::Async::FastCGI. It provides a slightly
 different API where it can take an argument containing the IO::Async::Loop
 object, rather than be added as Notifier object within one. It is provided
 mostly as a backward-compatibility wrapper for older code using this
 interface.
