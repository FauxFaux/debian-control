Description: flexible engine for running FCGI-based applications
 FCGI::Engine helps manage FCGI based web applications by providing a wrapper
 which handles most of the low-level FCGI details for you. It can run FCGI
 programs as simple scripts or as full standalone socket based servers who are
 managed by FCGI::Engine::ProcManager.
