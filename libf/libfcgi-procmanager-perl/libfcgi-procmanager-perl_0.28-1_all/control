Description: Perl module to help manage FastCGI applications
 FCGI::ProcManager serves as a FastCGI process manager, allowing developers to
 more finely tune performance in their web applications and take advantage of
 copy-on-write semantics prevalent in the UNIX kernel process system. It can
 manage a number of FastCGI servers and handles signals on their behalf.
