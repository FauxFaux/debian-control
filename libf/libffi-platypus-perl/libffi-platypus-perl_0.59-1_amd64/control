Description: module to create Perl bindings to non-Perl libraries with FFI
 FFI::Platypus is a library for creating interfaces to machine code libraries
 written in languages like C, C++, Fortran, Rust, Pascal. Essentially anything
 that gets compiled into machine code. This implementation uses libffi to
 accomplish this task. libffi is battle tested by a number of other scripting
 and virtual machine languages, such as Python and Ruby to serve a similar
 role.
