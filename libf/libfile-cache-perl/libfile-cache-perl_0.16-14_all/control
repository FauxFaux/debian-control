Description: File::Cache, a filesystem-based object store
 File::Cache implements an object store which shares data across process
 boundaries via the filesystem. It was written to complement IPC::Cache, but
 is suitable for larger numbers of more complex objects than that module.
 .
 This module will eventually be superseded by the newer Cache::Cache.
