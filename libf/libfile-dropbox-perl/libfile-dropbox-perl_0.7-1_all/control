Description: convenient and fast Dropbox API abstraction
 File::Dropbox provides high-level Dropbox API abstraction based on
 Tie::Handle. Code required to get access_token and access_secret for
 signed OAuth 1.0 requests or access_token for OAuth 2.0 requests is
 not included in this module. To get app_key and app_secret you need
 to register your application with Dropbox.
 .
 At this moment Dropbox API is not fully supported, File::Dropbox
 covers file read/write and directory listing methods. If you need full
 API support take look at WebService::Dropbox. File::Dropbox main
 purpose is not 100% API coverage, but simple and high-performance
 file operations.
