Description: object oriented File::Find replacement
 File::Find::Object does same job as File::Find but works like an object and
 with an iterator. As File::Find is not object oriented, one can't perform
 multiple searches in the same application. The second problem of File::Find
 is its file processing: after starting its main loop, one can't easily wait
 for another event and so get the next result.
