Description: module to search for files based on rules
 File::Find::Rule is a Perl module which essentially provides an easy-to-use
 interface to the popular module, File::Find. It provides a way to build rules
 that specify desired file and directory names using a text-globbing syntax
 (provided by Text::Glob). This makes it useful for simple tasks, like finding
 all ".pm" files in a given directory.
