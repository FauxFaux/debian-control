Description: Perl module to exclude files/directories for Version Control Systems
 Many tools need to be equally useful both on ordinary files, and on
 code that has been checked out from revision control systems.
 .
 File::Find::Rule::VCS provides quick and convenient methods to
 File::Find::Rule for exclusion of the version control directories of
 several major Version Control Systems (currently CVS, Subversion,
 Bazaar, RCS, Git and Mercurial).
