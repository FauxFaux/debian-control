Description: module for manipulating files and directories as objects
 File::Fu is a Perl module that provides an method of manipulating directories
 and files as objects, making use of operator overloading to allow for precise
 composition fo paths and support for many built-in methods. It also provides
 a way to create temporary directories and files.

 The interface and style provided by this module are quite different than Perl
 built-in functions or File::Spec. The syntax is concise and errors are checked
 using exceptions, so you never need to check a return code.
