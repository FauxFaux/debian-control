Description: Perl module to ease editing a file in-place
 File::Inplace is a perl module intended to ease the common task of editing a
 file in-place. Inspired by variations of perl's -i option, this module is
 intended for somewhat more structured and reusable editing than command line
 perl typically allows. File::Inplace endeavors to guarantee file integrity;
 that is, either all of the changes made will be saved to the file, or none
 will. It also offers functionality such as backup creation, automatic field
 splitting per-line, automatic chomping/unchomping, and aborting edits
 partially through without affecting the original file.
