Description: module to modify attributes of symlinks without dereferencing them
 The regular chown system call will dereference a symlink and apply ownership
 changes to the file at which it points. Some OSes provide system calls that
 do not dereference a symlink but instead apply their changes directly to the
 named path, even if that path is a symlink (in much the same way that lstat
 will return attributes of a symlink rather than the file at which it points).
 .
 File::lchown provides a wrapper around those system calls.
