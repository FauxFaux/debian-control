Description: recursive version of mkdir() and rmdir()
 The goal of File::Path::Tiny is simply to provide recursive versions of mkdir()
 and rmdir() with as little code and overhead as possible.
 .
 File::Path::Tiny is in no way meant to derogate File::Path and is in no way
 an endorsement to go out and replace all use of File::Path with
 File::Path::Tiny.
