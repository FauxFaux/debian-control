Description: interface for reading one or more files
 File::Read mainly proposes functions for reading one or more files, with
 different options.
 .
 This module was created to address a quite specific need: reading many files,
 some as a normal user and others as root, and eventually do a little more
 processing, all while being at the same time compatible with Perl 5.004.
 File::Slurp addresses the first point, but not the others, hence the creation
 of File::Read. If you don't need reading files as root or the post-processing
 features, then it's faster to directly use File::Slurp.
