Description: Perl module for reading a file backwards by lines
 File::ReadBackwards reads a file backwards line by line. It is simple to use,
 memory efficient and fast. It supports both an object and a tied handle
 interface.
 .
 It is intended for processing log and other similar text files which
 typically have their newest entries appended to them. By default files
 are assumed to be plain text and have a line ending appropriate to the
 OS. But you can set the input record separator string on a per file
 basis.
