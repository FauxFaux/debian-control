Description: Perl module to remove files or directories
 File::Remove::remove removes files and directories.  It acts like
 /bin/rm, for the most part.  Although unlink can be given a list
 of files, it will not remove directories; this module remedies that.
 It also accepts wildcards, * and ?, as arguments for filenames.
