Description: Perl module interface to rsync
 File::Rsync provides a convenience wrapper for the rsync program. Options
 may be passed in the form of a hash and are the same as the long options
 in rsync with the leading double-dash removed. Any options passed at
 creation are stored in the object as defaults for all future exec calls on
 that object.
