Description: Perl extension to place file safely under user home directory
 File::Save::Home provides several functions which try to determine
 whether you can, indeed, safely create directories and files underneath
 a user's home directory. Among other things, if you are placing a file
 in such a location only temporarily -- say, for testing purposes -- you
 can temporarily hide any already existing file with the same name and
 restore it to its original name and timestamps when you are done.
