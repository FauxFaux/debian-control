Description: module to locate non-code files during run-time
 The intent of File::ShareDir is to provide a companion to Class::Inspector and
 File::HomeDir, modules that take a process that is well-known by advanced Perl
 developers but gets a little tricky, and make it more available to the larger
 Perl community.
