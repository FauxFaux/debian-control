Description: File::Tail perl module
 The File::Tail module is designed for reading files which
 are continuously appended to (the name comes from the tail -f
 directive). Usually such files are logfiles of some description.
 .
 The module tries hard not to busy wait on the file, dynamicaly
 calculating how long it should wait before it pays to try reading the
 file again.
 .
 The module should handle normal log truncations ("close; move; open" or
 "cat /dev/null >file") transparently, without losing any input.
