Description: Perl module that allows ungetting of multiple bytes
 FileHandle::Unget is a Perl Module that is a drop-in replacement for the
 standard FileHandle module. It allows more than one byte to be placed back
 on the input. It also provides ungets to unget a string, which is useful if
 the filehandle refers to a stream for which you can't just seek() backwards.
