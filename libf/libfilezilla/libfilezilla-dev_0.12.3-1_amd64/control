Description: build high-performing platform-independent programs (development)
 Free, open source C++ library, offering some basic functionality to build
 high-performing, platform-independent programs. Some of the highlights include:
 .
  - A typesafe, multi-threaded event system that's very simple to use yet
    extremely efficient
  - Timers for periodic events
  - A datetime class that not only tracks timestamp but also their accuracy,
    which simplifies dealing with timestamps originating from different sources
  - Simple process handling for spawning child processes with redirected I/O
 .
 This package contains the development files for the library.
