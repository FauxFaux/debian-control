Description: perl interface to the PermanentTSB Open24 homebanking
 Finance::Bank::IE::PermanentTSB provides a set of functions which can be
 used in perl programs to interact with the Open24 homebanking (www.open24.ie)
 .
 The module will allow the user to check the account balance and to display
 an account statement for a particular time range.
 .
 This package also includes a CLI tool (ptsb), which will provide the same
 functionalities of the module and will also use gnuplot to draw graphs
 about the status of a bank account.
