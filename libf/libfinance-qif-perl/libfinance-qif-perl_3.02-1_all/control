Description: Parse and create Quicken Interchange Format files
 Finance::QIF is a module for working with QIF (Quicken Interchange Format)
 files in Perl. Finance::QIF reads QIF data records from a file passing each
 successive record to the caller for processing. This module also has the
 capability of writing QIF records to a file.
 .
 The QIF file format typically consists of a header containing a record or
 transaction type, followed by associated data records. Within a file there
 may be multiple headers. Headers are usually followed by data records,
 however data is not required to always follow a header.
 .
 A hash reference is returned for each record read from a file. The hash will
 have a "header" value which contains the header type that was read along with
 all supported values found for that record. If a value is not specified in
 the data file, the value will not exist in this hash.
