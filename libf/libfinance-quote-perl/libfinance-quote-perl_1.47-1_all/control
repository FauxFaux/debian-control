Description: Perl module for retrieving stock quotes from a variety of sources
 Finance::Quote gets stock quotes from various internet sources, including
 Yahoo! Finance, Fidelity Investments, and the Australian Stock Exchange.
 There are two methods of using this module -- a functional interface
 that is depreciated, and an object-orientated method that provides
 greater flexibility and stability.
