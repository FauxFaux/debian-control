Description: simple API that wraps Xiph.Org audio codecs
 libfishsound is a wrapper around the existing codec libraries and
 provides a consistent, higher-level programming interface. It has been
 designed for use in a wide variety of applications; it has no direct
 dependencies on Annodex or Ogg encapsulation, though it is most commonly
 used in conjunction with liboggz to decode or encode Ogg encapsulated
 Vorbis or Speex files.
