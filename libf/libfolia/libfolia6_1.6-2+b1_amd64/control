Description: Implementation of the FoLiA document format
 FoLiA is an XML-based format for Linguistic Annotation suitable for
 representing written language resources such as corpora.
 Its goal is to unify a variety of linguistic annotations in one single rich
 format, without committing to any particular standard annotation set.
 Instead, it seeks to accommodate any desired system or tagset, and so offer
 maximum flexibility. This makes FoLiA language independent.
 see https://proycon.github.io/folia for more information.
