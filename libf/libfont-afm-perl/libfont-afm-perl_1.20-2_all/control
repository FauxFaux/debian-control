Description: Font::AFM - Interface to Adobe Font Metrics files
 This module implements the Font::AFM class. Objects of this class are
 initialised from an AFM-file and allows you to obtain information
 about the font and the metrics of the various glyphs in the font.
 .
 All measurements in AFM files are given in terms of units equal to
 1/1000 of the scale factor of the font being used. To compute actual
 sizes in a document, these amounts should be multiplied by (scale
 factor of font)/1000.
