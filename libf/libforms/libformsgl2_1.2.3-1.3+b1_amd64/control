Description: The OpenGL XForms graphical interface widget library
 This package contains the OpenGL bindings of the XForms shared library.
 .
 XForms is a GUI toolkit based on Xlib for X Window Systems. It features a
 rich set of objects, such as buttons, scrollbars, and menus etc.
 integrated into an easy and efficient object/event callback execution
 model that allows fast and easy construction of X-applications. In
 addition, the library is extensible and new objects can easily be created
 and added to the library.
