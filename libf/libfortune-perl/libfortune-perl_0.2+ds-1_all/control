Description: Perl module to read fortune (strfile) databases
 The fortune program is a small but important part of the
 Unix culture, and this module aims to provide support for
 its "fortune cookie" databases to Perl programmes.
 .
 For efficiency, all versions of fortune rely on a binary
 header consisting mainly of offsets into the fortune file
 proper.
 .
 Modern versions of fortune keep this header in a
 separate file, and this is the style adopted by the
 Fortune module; the older style of munging the header and
 data into one large "compiled" file is not (currently)
 supported.
