Description: Software defined radio support for FreeSRP hardware (library)
 The FreeSRP has a tuning range from 70 MHz to 6 GHz, uses a 12-bit
 ADC with a sampling rate of up to 61.44 MSPS, and has a maximum
 analog filter bandwidth of 56 MHz. It is a full-duplex radio (can
 transmit & receive at the same time). The main chip in the unit is
 the fairly expensive (~$150 USD) AD9364 integrated RF transceiver
 chip and it also comes with a Xilinx Artix 7 FPGA. Furthermore the
 hardware and code is entirely open source.
 .
 This package is the software that provides control of the USB hardware
 and an API to pass data to software defined radio applications on the host.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
