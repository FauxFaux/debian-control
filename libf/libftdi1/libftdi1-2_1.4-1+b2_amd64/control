Description: Library to control and program the FTDI USB controllers
 This library could talk to FTDI's FT232BM, FT245BM, FT2232C, FT2232D, FT245R,
 FT232H and FT230X type USB chips from userspace. It uses libusb 1.0 to

 mode, in bitbang mode, and to read or write the serial EEPROM.

 This is the C version of the library.
