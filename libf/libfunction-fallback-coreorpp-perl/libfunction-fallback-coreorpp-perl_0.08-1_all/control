Description: set of functions using non-core XS modules with pure-Perl/core fallback
 Function::Fallback::CoreOrPP provides functions that use non-core XS modules
 (for best speed, reliability, feature, etc) but falls back to those that use
 core XS or pure-Perl modules when the non-core XS module is not available.
 .
 This module helps when you want to bootstrap your Perl application with a
 portable, dependency-free Perl script. In a vanilla Perl installation (having
 only core modules), you can use App::FatPacker to include non-core pure-Perl
 dependencies to your script.
