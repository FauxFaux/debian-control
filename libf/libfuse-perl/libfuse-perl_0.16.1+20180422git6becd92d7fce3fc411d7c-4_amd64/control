Description: Perl bindings for FUSE (Filesystems in USErland
 This module lets you implement filesystems in perl, through the FUSE
 interface
 .
 FUSE (Filesystem in USErspace) is a simple interface for userspace
 programs to export a virtual filesystem to the kernel. FUSE
 also aims to provide a secure method for non privileged users to
 create and mount their own filesystem implementations.
