Description: GAP kernel as a C shared library -- lib
 GAP is a system for computational group theory. LibGAP contains a shared
 library version of the GAP kernel, allowing you to directly talk to GAP
 from your own C/C++ code.
 .
 Much of the group theory in SageMath is implemented using LibGAP.
 .
 This package provides the dynamic library.
