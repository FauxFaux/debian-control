Description: data abstraction library based on GLib -- GObject Introspection
 libgda is a (relatively small) database abstraction/access library
 integrated on the GLib object model. It can be used as a metadata
 extractor, to get information about all database objects in a common
 way, and as an ODBC-like wrapper to access data in different engines
 through an easier API.
 .
 This package contains introspection data for libgda.
