Description: IO library for the GDF -- Matlab interface
 GDF (General Dataformat for Biosignals) is intended to provide a generic
 storage for biosignals, such as EEG, ECG, MEG etc.
 .
 This package builds Matlab bindings for GDF at installation
 time. Note that this package depends on Matlab -- a commercial
 software that needs to be obtain and installed separately.
