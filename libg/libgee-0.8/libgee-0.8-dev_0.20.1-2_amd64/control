Description: GObject based collection and utility library (development files)
 libgee is a collection library providing GObject-based interfaces and
 classes for commonly used data structures.
 .
 libgee provides the following interfaces:
  * Traversable
    - Iterable
         + Collection
           # List
             * BidirList
           # Set
             * SortedSet
               - BidirSortedSet
           # MultiSet
           # Queue
             * Deque
         + Map
           # SortedMap
             * BidirSortedMap
    - Iterator
         + BidirIterator
           # BidirListIterator
         + ListIterator
           # BidirListIterator
  * MultiMap
  * Future
 .
 The ArrayList, ArrauQueue, ConcurrentLinkedList, ConcurrentSet, HashSet,
 HashMap, HashMultiSet, HashMultiMap, LinkedList, PriorityQueue, Promise,
 TreeSet, TreeMap, TreeMultiSet, and TreeMultiMap classes provide a
 reasonable sample implementation of those interfaces. In addition, a set of
 abstract classes are provided to ease the implementation of new collections.
 .
 Around that, the API provides means to retrieve read-only views, efficient
 sort algorithms, simple, bi-directional or index-based mutable iterators
 depending on the collection type.
 .
 libgee is written in Vala and can be used like any GObject-based C library.
 It's planned to provide bindings for further languages.
 .
 This package contains the headers and development libraries.
