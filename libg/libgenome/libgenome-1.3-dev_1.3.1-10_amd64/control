Description: toolkit for developing bioinformatic related software (devel)
 libGenome is a freely available toolkit for developing bioinformatic related
 software in C++.  It is intended to take the hassle out of performing common
 tasks on genetic sequence and annotation data.
 .
 Among other things, libGenome can help you:
 .
  * Read and write Multi-FastA format files
  * Read and write GenBank flat file database entries
  * Append, chop, truncate, reverse, complement, translate, and otherwise
    mangle sequence data
  * Access annotation in GenBank flat files
 .
 This is the development package containing the statically linked
 library and the header files.
