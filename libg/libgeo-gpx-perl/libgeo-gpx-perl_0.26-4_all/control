Description: Perl module for creating and parsing GPX files
 The original goal of Geo::Gpx was to produce GPX/XML files which were
 parseable by both GPX Spinner and EasyGPS. As of version 0.13 it has been
 extended to support general parsing and generation of GPX data. Both GPX 1.0
 and 1.1 are supported.
