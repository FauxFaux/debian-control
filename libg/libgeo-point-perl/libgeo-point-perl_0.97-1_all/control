Description: module to simplify handling geographic points
 One location on the globe, in any coordinate system. Geo::Point tries
 to hide the maths and the coordinate system in which the point is
 represented.
 .
 One of the most confusing things when handling geometrical data, is
 that sometimes latlong, sometimes xy are used: horizontal and vertical
 organization reversed. This package tries to hide this from your
 program by providing abstract accessors latlong(), longlat(), xy(), and
 yx().
 .
 This package provides the following modules:
  * Geo::Line - a sequence of connected points
  * Geo::Point - a point on the globe
  * Geo::Proj - simplified wrapper for Geo::Proj4
  * Geo::Shape - base class for 2-dimensional points on the earth
    surface
  * Geo::Space - A collection of various items
  * Geo::Surface - A surface description
