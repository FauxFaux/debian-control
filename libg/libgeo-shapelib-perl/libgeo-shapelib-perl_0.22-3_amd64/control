Description: Perl extension for reading and writing shapefiles as defined by ESRI
 Geo::Shapelib is a module to read, create and write shapefiles as
 defined by ESRI, using Perl. It provides the Perl binding for the Shapelib
 library.
 .
 The Shapefile format is a working and interchange format promoted by
 ESRI for simple vector data with attributes. It is apparently the only
 file format that can be edited in ARCView 2/3, and can also be exported
 and imported in ArcGis.
