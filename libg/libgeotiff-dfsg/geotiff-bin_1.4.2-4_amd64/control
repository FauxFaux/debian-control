Description: GeoTIFF (geografic enabled TIFF) library -- tools
 This C library supports TIFF 6.0 based interchange format for georeferenced
 raster imagery. The GeoTIFF standard has been developed for reading, and
 writing geographic meta-information tags on top of TIFF raster.
 .
 The GeoTIFF library comes with two utility programs here included:
 .
  listgeo - dumps the metadata of a GeoTIFF file.
  geotifcp - applies metadata to a TIFF file, making it a GeoTIFF file.
