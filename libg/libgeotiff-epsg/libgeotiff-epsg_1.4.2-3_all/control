Description: GeoTIFF library -- EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset
 This C library supports TIFF 6.0 based interchange format for
 georeferenced raster imagery. The GeoTIFF standard has been developed
 for reading, and writing geographic meta-information tags on top of
 TIFF raster.
 .
 This package contains EPSG Geodetic Paramenters data files which can be
 used with standard projections. These data are useful to better dump
 geo-contents of many GeoTIFF files.
