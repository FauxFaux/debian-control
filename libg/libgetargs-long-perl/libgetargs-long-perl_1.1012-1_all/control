Description: Perl module to parse long function arguments
 The Getargs::Long module allows usage of named parameters in function
 calls, along with optional argument type-checking.  It provides an easy
 way to get at the parameters within the routine, and yields concise
 descriptions for the common cases of all-mandatory and all-optional
 parameter lists.
 .
 The validation of arguments can be done by a structure-driven routine
 getargs() which is fine for infrequently called routines (but should be
 slower), or via a dedicated routine created and compiled on the fly the
 first time it is needed, by using the cgetargs() family (expected to be
 faster).
 .
 The Log::Agent module is used to report errors, which leaves to the
 application the choice of the final logging method: to a file, to
 STDERR, or to syslog.
 .
 Note that this module is still in the alpha stage of development, and
 the interface to it may change: indeed, it changed between 0.1.2 and
 0.1.3.
