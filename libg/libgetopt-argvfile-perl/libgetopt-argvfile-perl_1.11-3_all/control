Description: Perl module for reading script options and parameters from files
 This module simply interpolates option file hints in @ARGV by the
 contents of the pointed files.  This enables option reading from
 files instead of or additional to the usual reading from the command
 line.
 .
 Alternatively, you can process any array instead of @ARGV which is
 used by default and mentioned mostly in this manual.
 .
 The interpolated @ARGV could be subsequently processed by the usual
 option handling, e.g. by a Getopt::xxx module.  Getopt::ArgvFile does
 not perform any option handling itself, it only prepares the array
 @ARGV.
