Description: programmable shell completion for Perl apps
 Getopt::Complete makes it easy to add custom command-line completion to Perl
 applications. It also does additional validation of arguments, when the
 program is actually executed, based on completion lists.
 .
 Support is also present for apps which are an entry point for a hierarchy of
 sub-commands (in the style of cvs and git).
 .
 Getopt::Complete also wraps the standard options processing and exports it as
 a %ARGS hash at compile time, making using the arguments hassle-free.
 .
 The completion features currently work with the bash shell, which is the
 default on most Linux and Mac systems. Patches for other shells are welcome.
