Description: development files for libgig
 libgig is a C++ library for loading, modifying and creating Gigasampler
 files and DLS (Downloadable Sounds) Level 1/2 files.
 .
 Since the Gigasampler / GigaStudio and DLS formats are based ontop
 of the binary RIFF container format, this library also provides
 convenient access to RIFF files in general.
 .
 This package also contains a Linux/POSIX ported version of libakai,
 which provides support for reading Akai formatted medias (CDRoms, HDs,
 Zip disks).
 Currently Akai S1000, S01, S2000 and S3000 series are supported.
 .
 This package contains the header files needed for development with
 libgig. You will need this only if you intend to compile programs
 that use this library.
