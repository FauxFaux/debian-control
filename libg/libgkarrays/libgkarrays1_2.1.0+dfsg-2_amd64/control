Description: library to query large collection of NGS sequences
 Gk-arrays are provided as a simple-to-use C++ library dedicated to
 queries on large collection of sequences as produced by high-throughput
 sequencers (e.g. HiSeq 2000 from Illumina, 454 from Roche).
 .
 Gk-arrays index k-mers of reads and allows one to answer different queries
 on that read collection (e.g. how many reads share this k-mer? where does
 this k-mer occur in the read collection?).
 .
 Gk-arrays consist of a space-efficient alternative to hash tables while
 being similar in terms of query times.
