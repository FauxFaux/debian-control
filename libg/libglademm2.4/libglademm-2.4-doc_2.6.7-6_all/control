Description: C++ wrappers for libglade2 (documentation)
 Libglade is a library which enables an application to build its graphical
 interface from an XML file (generated by Glade) at runtime. libglademm is
 the C++ wrapper for libglade.
 .
 libglade and libglademm have been deprecated since 2009. New code should
 use GtkBuilder (part of Gtk 3), or its C++ wrapper in gtkmm.
 .
 This package contains reference documentation and examples.
 .
 This package is for legacy applications and no longer used by GNOME.
