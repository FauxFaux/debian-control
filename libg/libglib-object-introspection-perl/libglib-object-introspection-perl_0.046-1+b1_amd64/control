Description: Perl bindings for gobject-introspection libraries
 GObject is an abstraction layer that allows programming with an object
 paradigm that is compatible with many languages. It is a part of Glib,
 the core library used to build GTK+ and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains Glib::Object::Introspection, the Perl binding
 generator for libraries that support gobject-introspection, such as
 GTK+, WebKit, libsoup and many more.
 .
 To use perli11ndoc, the Perl introspection documentation tool, the
 -dev version of the introspected library must be installed. For
 example, perli11ndoc can only show documentation for libgtk3-perl if
 libgtk-3-dev is installed.
