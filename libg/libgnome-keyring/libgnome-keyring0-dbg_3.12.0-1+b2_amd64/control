Description: GNOME keyring services library (debugging symbols)
 gnome-keyring is a daemon in the session, similar to ssh-agent,
 and other applications can use it to store passwords and other
 sensitive information.
 .
 The program can manage several keyrings, each with its own master
 password, and there is also a session keyring which is never stored to
 disk, but forgotten when the session ends.
 .
 This package contains detached debugging symbols for the shared
 libraries.
 .
 Most people should not need this package.
