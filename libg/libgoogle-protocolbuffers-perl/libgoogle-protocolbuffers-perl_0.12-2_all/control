Description: simple Perl interface to Google Protocol Buffers
 Google Protocol Buffers is a data serialization format. It is binary (and
 hence compact and fast for serialization) and as extendable as XML; its
 nearest analogues are Thrift and ASN.1. There are official mappings for C++,
 Java and Python languages; this library is a mapping for Perl.
