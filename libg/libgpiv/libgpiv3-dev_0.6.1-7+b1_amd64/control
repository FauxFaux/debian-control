Description: library for Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) - development files
 This library contains functions for evaluating images from a fluid flow
 by means of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), resulting into a velocity
 field of the fluid flow. It includes the core functions for interrogation,
 data validation, post-processing, input/output and memory allocation.
