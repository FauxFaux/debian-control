Description: library for Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)
 This library contains functions for evaluating images from a fluid
 flow by means of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV).
 .
 PIV is a way to film the wind or liquid flows. It uses a sequence of
 at least two images that are recorded with a well controlled
 separation time in-between. Tracer particles that are resident in the
 fluid may be illuminated by a light source, mostly a laser, that has
 been re-shaped into a sheet of light. In this way, the average
 displacement and the deformation of the image texture is
 obtained. Applying this analyses on small samples of the images on a
 (rectangular) grid results into an instantaneous velocity field of
 the fluid flow. PIV may also be applied for other purposes, like
 deformations and vibrations of solid surfaces.
 .
 This library includes the core functions for image recording,
 processing, interrogation, PIV data validation, post-processing,
 input/output functions and memory allocation.
