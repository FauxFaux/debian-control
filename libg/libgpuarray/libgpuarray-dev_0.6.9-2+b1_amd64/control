Description: development files for libgpuarray
 libgpuarray provides a ndarray (multi-dimensional array) object which
 is computed on the GPU. It supports int, single and double precision
 floats.
 .
 libgpuarray supports Nvidia's CUDA interface as well as OpenCL. The
 Debian packages have been build against OpenCL. However, the source
 package could be rebuild locally also for CUDA (which is non-free)
 without changes, if that's needed.
 .
 This package provides the development files.
