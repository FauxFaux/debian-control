Description: Perl module to convert or render graphs (as ASCII, HTML, SVG or via Graphviz)
 Graph::Easy lets you generate graphs consisting of various shaped nodes
 connected by edges (with optional labels).
 .
 It can read and write graphs in a variety of formats, as well as render
 them via its own grid-based layouter. It has export filters for Graphviz,
 VCG (Visualizing Compiler Graphs), GDL (Graph Description Language) and
 GraphML. Import filters are for Graphviz, VCG and GDL.
 .
 Since the layouter works on a grid (manhattan layout), the output is
 most useful for flow charts, network diagrams, or hierarchy trees.
 .
 Graph::Easy has an easy-to-understand, compact and human readable graph
 description language.
