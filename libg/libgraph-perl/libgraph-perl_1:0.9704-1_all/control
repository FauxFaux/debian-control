Description: Perl module for graph data structures and algorithms
 This module contains the Graph module for Perl, a framework for
 creating abstract data structures called graphs and hypergraphs.
 (It is not for drawing any sort of graphics; for that, see the
 GD:: or Graphics:: set of modules.) It also contains implementations
 of several well-known algorithms that operate on graphs, such as
 finding transitive closures, strongly connected components
 (SCCs) and articulation points.
