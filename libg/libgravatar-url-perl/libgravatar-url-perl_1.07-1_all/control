Description: Perl interface to make URLs for Gravatars from an email address
 A Gravatar is a Globally Recognized Avatar for a given email address. This
 allows you to have a global picture associated with your email address. You
 can look up the Gravatar for any email address by constructing a URL to get
 the image from gravatar.com. Gravatar::URL does that.
