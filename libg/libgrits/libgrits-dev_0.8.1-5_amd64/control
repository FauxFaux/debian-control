Description: Development files for grits
 Grits is a "Virtual Globe" library which uses OpenGL to render an image of
 the earth using satellite and terrain data from publicly accessible servers.
 This is similar in concept to Google Earth and NASA World Wind, except
 implemented as a library.
 .
 This package contains the header files and libraries which are needed for
 developing programs that use grits.
