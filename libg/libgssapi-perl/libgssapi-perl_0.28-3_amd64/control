Description: Perl extension providing access to the GSSAPIv2 library
 This module gives access to the routines of the GSSAPI library,
 as described in rfc2743 and rfc2744 and implemented by the
 Kerberos-1.2 distribution from MIT.
 .
 The API presented by this module is a mildly object oriented
 reinterpretation of the C API, where opaque C structures are
 Perl objects, but the style of function call has been left
 mostly untouched.  As a result, most routines modify one or
 more of the parameters passed to them, reflecting the C
 call-by-reference (or call-by-value-return) semantics.
