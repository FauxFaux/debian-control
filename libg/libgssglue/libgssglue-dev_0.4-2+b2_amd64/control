Description: header files and docs for libgssglue
 Contains the header files and documentation for libgssglue
 for use in developing applications that use the libgssglue library.
 .
 libgssglue provides a gssapi interface, but does not implement any
 gssapi mechanisms itself; instead it calls other gssapi functions
 (e.g., those provided by MIT Kerberos), depending on the requested
 mechanism, to do the work.
