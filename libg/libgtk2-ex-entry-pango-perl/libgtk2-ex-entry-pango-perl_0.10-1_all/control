Description: Gtk2::Entry that accepts pango markup
 Gtk2::Ex::Entry::Pango is a Gtk2::Entry that can accept Pango markup for
 various purposes (for more information about Pango text markup language see
 http://library.gnome.org/devel/pango/stable/PangoMarkupFormat.html).
 .
 The widget allows Pango markup to be used for input as an alternative to
 set_text or for setting a default value when the widget is empty. The default
 value when empty is ideal for standalone text entries that have no accompanying
 label (such as a text field for a search).
 .
 This widget allows for the text data to be entered either through the normal
 methods provided by Gtk2::Entry or to use the method /set_markup. It's
 possible to switch between two methods for applying the text. The standard
 Gtk2::Entry methods will always apply a text without styles while
 set_markup() will use a style.
