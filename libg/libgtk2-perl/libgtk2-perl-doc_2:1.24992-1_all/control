Description: Perl interface to the Gtk 2.x series (documentation files)
 Gtk2 allows you to write graphical user interfaces in a Perlish and
 object-oriented way, freeing you from the casting and memory management in C,
 yet remaining very close in spirit to original API.
 .
 Gtk+ is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces.
 Offering a complete set of widgets, the Gtk+ is suitable for projects ranging
 from small one-off tools to complete application suites. Find out more about
 Gtk+ at http://www.gtk.org.
 .
 This package contains the documentation for the Gtk2 perl modules and some
 examples.
