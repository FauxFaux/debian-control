Description: Perl simple interface to GTK+ 3's complex MVC list widget
 Gtk3 has a powerful, but complex MVC (Model, View, Controller) system used to
 implement list and tree widgets. Gtk3::SimpleList automates the complex setup
 work and allows you to treat the list model as a more natural list of lists
 structure.
 .
 After creating a new Gtk3::SimpleList object with the desired columns you may
 set the list data with a simple Perl array assignment. Rows may be added or
 deleted with all of the normal array operations. You can treat the data
 member of the list simplelist object as an array reference, and manipulate
 the list data with perl's normal array operators.
 .
 A mechanism has also been put into place allowing columns to be Perl scalars.
 The scalar is converted to text through Perl's normal mechanisms and then
 displayed in the list. This same mechanism can be expanded by defining
 arbitrary new column types before calling the new function.
