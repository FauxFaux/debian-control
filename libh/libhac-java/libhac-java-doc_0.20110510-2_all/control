Description: API documentation for hierarchical agglomerative clustering
 Hac is a simple library for hierarchical agglomerative clustering. The goal of
 Hac is to be easy to use in any context that might require a hierarchical
 agglomerative clustering approach. You can use Hac by bundling Hac with your
 application, and by implementing two interfaces:
  * Experiment (to tell Hac what to cluster), and
  * DissimilarityMeasure (to tell Hac how to compute the dissimilarity between
    two observations).
 .
 This package contains the API documentation of libhac-java.
