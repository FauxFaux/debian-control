Description: Perl modules to treat hashes as objects
 A Hash::AsObject is a blessed hash that provides read-write
 access to its elements using accessors.  (Actually, they're both accessors
 and mutators.)
 .
 It's designed to act as much like a plain hash as possible; this means, for
 example, that you can use methods like DESTROY to get or set hash elements
 with that name.
