Description: Hierarchical Data Format library -- runtime package
 HDF is a multi-object file format for storing and transferring
 graphical and numerical data mainly used in scientific computing. HDF
 supports several different data models, including multidimensional
 arrays, raster images, and tables.
 Each defines a specific aggregate data type and provides an API for
 reading, writing, and organizing the data and metadata. New data models
 can be added by the HDF developers or users.
 .
 This package includes some basic utilities to view, pack, unpack,
 HDF files.
