Description: Hierarchical Data Format development files (without NetCDF)
 HDF is a multi-object file format for storing and transferring
 graphical and numerical data mainly used in scientific computing. HDF
 supports several different data models, including multidimensional
 arrays, raster images, and tables.
 Each defines a specific aggregate data type and provides an API for
 reading, writing, and organizing the data and metadata. New data models
 can be added by the HDF developers or users.
 .
 This package contains development stuff, including files and static
 library for the HDF package in the flavor compatible with the
 NetCDF library.
