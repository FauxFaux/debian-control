Description: Hierarchical Data Format library -- documentation
 HDF  is  a  multi-object  file  format  for  storing  and  transferring
 graphical  and  numerical data mainly used in scientific computing.
 HDF  supports  several different  data models, including  multidimensional
 arrays, raster images,  and tables.
 Each defines  a specific aggregate  data type  and provides an  API for
 reading, writing, and organizing the data and metadata. New data models
 can be added by the HDF developers or users.
