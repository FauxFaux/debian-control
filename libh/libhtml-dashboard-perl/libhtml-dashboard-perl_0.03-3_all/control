Description: module that tries to achieve spreadsheet-like formatting for HTML tables
 Rather than having to build up an HTML table from data, row by row and cell
 by cell, applying formatting rules at every step, HTML::Dashboard allows the
 user to specify a set of simple rules with the desired formatting options.
 HTML::Dashboard will evaluate the rules and apply the formatting options as
 necessary.
