Description: cleans HTML and CSS of scripting, executable contents and XSS attacks
 HTML::Defang accepts an input HTML and/or CSS string and removes any
 executable code including scripting, embedded objects, applets, etc.,
 and neutralises any XSS attacks. A whitelist based approach is used
 which means only HTML known to be safe is allowed through.
 .
 HTML::Defang uses a custom html tag parser. The parser has been
 designed and tested to work with nasty real world html and to try and
 emulate as close as possible what browsers actually do with strange
 looking constructs. The test suite has been built based on examples
 from a range of sources such as <http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html> and
 <http://imfo.ru/csstest/css_hacks/import.php> to ensure that as many as
 possible XSS attack scenarios have been dealt with.
