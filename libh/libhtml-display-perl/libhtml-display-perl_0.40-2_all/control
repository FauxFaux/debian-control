Description: module for displaying HTML locally in a browser
 HTML::Display abstracts the task of displaying HTML to the user. The
 displaying is done by launching a browser and navigating it to either a
 temporary file with the HTML stored in it, or, if possible, by pushing the
 HTML directly into the browser window.
 .
 The module tries to automagically select the "correct" browser, but if it
 doesn't find a good browser, you can modify the behaviour by setting some
 environment variables.
