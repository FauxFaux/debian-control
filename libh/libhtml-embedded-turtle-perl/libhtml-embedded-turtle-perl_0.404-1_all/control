Description: embedding RDF in HTML the crazy way
 Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard model for data
 interchange on the Web.
 .
 RDF can be embedded in (X)HTML using simple <script> tags. This is
 described at http://esw.w3.org/N3inHTML . This gives you a file format
 that can contain multiple (optionally named) graphs.
 .
 HTML::Embedded::Turtle parses HTML files containing such graphs, and
 allows you to access them each individually; as a union of all graphs
 on the page; or as a union of just the endorsed graphs.
 .
 Despite the module name, this module supports a variety of script
 types:
  * text/turtle
  * application/turtle
  * application/x-turtle
  * text/plain (N-Triples)
  * application/x-rdf+json (RDF/JSON)
  * application/json (RDF/JSON)
  * application/rdf+xml (RDF/XML)
 .
 Although it doesn't support full N3, it recognises the following as
 well, but treats them as Turtle:
  * text/n3
  * text/rdf+n3
