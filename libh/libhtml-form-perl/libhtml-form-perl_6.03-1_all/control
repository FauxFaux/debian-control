Description: module that represents an HTML form element
 Objects of the HTML::Form class represents a single HTML <form> ... </form>
 instance. A form consists of a sequence of inputs that usually have names,
 and which can take on various values. The state of a form can be tweaked and
 it can then be asked to provide HTTP::Request objects that can be passed to
 the request() method of LWP::UserAgent.
