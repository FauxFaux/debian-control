Description: Perl module to converts HTML to Text with tables intact
 HTML::FormatText::WithLinks::AndTables was inspired by
 HTML::FormatText::WithLinks which has proven to be a useful `lynx -dump`
 work-alike.
 .
 This module can in a rudimentary sense do so. The aim was to provide
 facility to take a simple HTML based email template, and to also convert
 it to text with the <TABLE> structure intact for inclusion as
 "multipart/alternative" content.
 .
 Further, it will preserve both the formatting specified by the <TD> tag's
 "align" attribute, and will also preserve multiline text inside of a <TD>
 element provided it is broken using <BR/> tags.
