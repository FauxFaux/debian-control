Description: module that creates a 'smart' list of HTML links
 HTML::LinkList contains a number of functions for taking sets of URLs and
 labels and creating suitably formatted HTML. These links are "smart" because,
 if given the url of the current page, if any of the links in the list equal
 it, that item in the list will be formatted as a special label, not as a
 link; this is a Good Thing, since the user would be confused by clicking on a
 link back to the current page.
 .
 While many website systems have plugins for "smart" navbars, they are
 specialized for that system only, and can't be reused elsewhere, forcing
 people to reinvent the wheel. This is one of the wheels, free to be reused
 by anybody; just the simple functions, a backend, which can be plugged into
 whatever system you want.
 .
 The default format for the HTML is to make an unordered list, but there are
 many options, enabling one to have a flatter layout with any separators you
 desire, or a more complicated list with differing formats for different
 levels.
