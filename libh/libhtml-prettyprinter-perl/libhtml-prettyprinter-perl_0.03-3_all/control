Description: module that generates nice HTML files from HTML syntax trees
 HTML::PrettyPrinter produces nicely formatted HTML code from a HTML syntax
 tree. It is especially useful if the produced HTML file shall be read or
 edited manually afterwards. Various parameters let you adapt the output to
 different styles and requirements.
 .
 If you don't care how the HTML source looks like as long as it is valid and
 readable by browsers, you should use the as_HTML() method of HTML::Element
 instead of the pretty printer. It is about five times faster.
 .
 The pretty printer will handle line wrapping, indention and structuring by
 the way the whitespace in the tree is represented in the output. Furthermore
 upper/lowercase markup and markup minimization, quoting of attribute values,
 the encoding of entities and the presence of optional end tags are
 configurable.
