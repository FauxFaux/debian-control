Description: bare-bones HTML parser
 HTML::SimpleParse is a bare-bones HTML parser, similar to HTML::Parser,
 but with a couple important distinctions:
 .
 First, HTML::Parser knows which tags can contain other tags, which start
 tags have corresponding end tags, which tags can exist only in the <HEAD>
 portion of the document, and so forth.  HTML::SimpleParse does not know any
 of these things.  It just finds tags and text in the HTML you give it, it
 does not care about the specific content of these tags (though it does
 distinguish between different _types_ of tags, such as comments, starting
 tags like <b>, ending tags like </b>, and so on).
 .
 Second, HTML::SimpleParse does not create a hierarchical tree of HTML
 content, but rather a simple linear list.  It does not pay any attention to
 balancing start tags with corresponding end tags, or which pairs of tags are
 inside other pairs of tags.
