Description: module to strip HTML markup from text
 HTML::Strip simply strips HTML-like markup from text in a very quick and
 brutal manner. It could quite easily be used to strip XML or SGML from text
 as well.
 .
 It is written in XS, and thus about five times quicker than using regular
 expressions for the same task.
 .
 It does not do any syntax checking (if you want that, use HTML::Parser),
