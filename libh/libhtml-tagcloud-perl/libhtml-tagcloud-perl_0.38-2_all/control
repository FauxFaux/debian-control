Description: module for generating HTML indexes of popular tags
 HTML::TagCloud enables the generation of "tag clouds" on HTML pages.
 Tag clouds serve as a textual way to visualize terms and topics that
 are used most frequently. The tags are sorted alphabetically and a larger
 font is used to indicate more frequent term usage.
 .
 Example sites with tag clouds: <http://www.43things.com/>,
 <http://www.astray.com/recipes/> and <http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/>.
