Description: module for creating and updating an HTML Table of Contents
 HTML::Toc is a Perl module that provides a mechanism for creating an HTML
 Table of Contents (ToC) and for keeping it up-to-date. Because it models the
 information in memory, updating the table becomes very simple. The framework
 also includes helper modules to write the table as HTML and keep it updated.
