Description: HTML widget and validation framework
 HTML::Widget makes creating and maintaining HTML widgets easy.
 .
 Everything is optional, use validation only or just generate forms, you can
 embed and merge them later.
 .
 The API was designed similar to other popular modules like
 Data::FormValidator and FormValidator::Simple, HTML::FillInForm is also
 built in (and much faster).
