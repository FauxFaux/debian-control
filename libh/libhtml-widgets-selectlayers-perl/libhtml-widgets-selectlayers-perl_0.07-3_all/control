Description: Perl extension for selectable HTML layers
 HTML::Widgets::SelectLayers implements an HTML widget with multiple layers.
 Only one layer is visible at any given time, controlled by a <SELECT> box.
 For an example see http://www.420.am/selectlayers/
 .
 This HTML generated by this module uses JavaScript, but nevertheless attempts
 to be as cross-browser as possible. The 0.05 release drops Navigator 4
 compatibility and has been tested under Mozilla Firefox 1.0.6, MSIE 6.0,
 Konqueror 3.3.2, and Opera 8.0.2.
