Description: module for easy read/write access to HTTP::Cookies jar
 HTTP::CookieMonster was created because messing around with HTTP::Cookies is
 non-trivial. HTTP::Cookies is a very useful module, but using it is not always
 as easy and clean as it could be. HTTP::CookieMonster gives you a simple
 interface for getting and setting cookies.
