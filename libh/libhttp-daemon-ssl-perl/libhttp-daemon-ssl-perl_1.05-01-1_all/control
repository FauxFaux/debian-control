Description: Simple HTTP server class with SSL support
 HTTP::Daemon::SSL is a descendant of HTTP::Daemon that uses SSL sockets
 (via IO::Socket::SSL) instead of cleartext sockets.  It also handles
 SSL-specific problems, such as dealing with HTTP clients that attempt
 to connect to it without using SSL.
