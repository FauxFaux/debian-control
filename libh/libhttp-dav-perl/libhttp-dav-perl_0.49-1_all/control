Description: WebDAV client library for Perl, and "dave" CLI client
 HTTP::DAV provides client-side access to a DAV server.  DAV is a
 protocol for remote web-site authoring and management.  Now you can
 LOCK, DELETE and PUT files and much more on a DAV-enabled webserver.
 .
 The PerlDAV library consists of:
 .
  * HTTP::DAV - an object-oriented Web-DAV client API.
  * dave - the DAV Explorer, an end-user Unix console program for
    interacting with WebDAV servers. dave looks and feels like a
    standard Unix ftp program.
 .
