Description: HTTP Action, Adventure and Excitement
 HTTP::Headers::ActionPack is a module to handle the inflation and
 deflation of complex HTTP header types. In many cases header values are
 simple strings, but in some cases they are complex values with a lot of
 information encoded in them. The goal of this module is to make the
 parsing and analysis of these headers as easy as calling inflate on a
 compatible object.
