Description: Perl module to record interaction with websites
 HTTP::Recorder allows your Perl program to record the interaction with
 websites (SSL and non-SSL). It acts as a proxy agent for HTTP::Proxy,
 rewriting HTTP requests and responses while recording the interaction in a
 script suitable for WWW::Mechanize. If a JavaScript-enabled browser is being
 used, the script can be examined and modified as it is being recorded.
 .
 Since version 0.06, libhttp-recorder-perl includes a script httprecorder to
 quickly set up a proxy and start recording traffic.
