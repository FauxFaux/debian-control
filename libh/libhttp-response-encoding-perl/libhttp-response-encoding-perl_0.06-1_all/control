Description: Perl module extending HTTP::Response encoding handling
 HTTP::Response::Encoding is a Perl module that extends HTTP::Response class,
 providing a simple and convenient way to extract various information about
 encoded responses, including its character set. It can extract the character
 set exactly as it appears in the Content-Type header and it also understands
 the meta http-equiv tag in the response body.
