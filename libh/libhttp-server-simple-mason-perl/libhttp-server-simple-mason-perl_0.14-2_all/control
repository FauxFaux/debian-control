Description: abstract baseclass for a standalone mason server
 HTTP::Server::Simple::Mason is a simple standalone mason HTTP server.
 By default, it doesn't thread or fork. It does, however, act as a
 simple frontend which can be used to build a standalone web-based
 application or turn a CGI into one.
