Description: simple stand-alone HTTP server
 HTTP::Server::Simple is a simple standalone HTTP server. By default, it does
 not thread or fork. It does, however, act as a simple frontend which can be
 used to build a standalone web-based application or turn a CGI into one. (It
 is possible to use Net::Server to get threading, forking, preforking, etc.)
