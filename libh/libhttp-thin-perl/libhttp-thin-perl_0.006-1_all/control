Description: Thin Wrapper around HTTP::Tiny to play nice with HTTP::Message
 HTTP::Thin is a thin wrapper around HTTP::Tiny adding the ability to pass in
 HTTP::Request objects and get back HTTP::Response objects. The maintainers of
 HTTP::Tiny, justifiably, don't want to have to maintain compatibility but
 many other projects already consume the HTTP::Message objects. This is just
 glue code doing what it does best.
