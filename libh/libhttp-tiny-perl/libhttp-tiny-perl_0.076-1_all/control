Description: Perl module that implements a small, simple, correct HTTP/1.1 client
 HTTP::Tiny is a very simple HTTP/1.1 client, designed primarily for doing
 simple GET requests without the overhead of a large framework like
 LWP::UserAgent.
 .
 It is more correct and more complete than HTTP::Lite. It supports proxies
 (currently only non-authenticating ones) and redirection. It also correctly
 resumes after EINTR.
