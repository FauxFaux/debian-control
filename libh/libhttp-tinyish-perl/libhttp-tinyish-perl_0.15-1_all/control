Description: HTTP::Tiny compatible HTTP client wrappers
 HTTP::Tinyish is a wrapper module for HTTP client modules LWP, HTTP::Tiny and
 HTTP client software curl and wget.
 .
 It provides an API compatible to HTTP::Tiny, and the implementation has been
 extracted out of App::cpanminus. HTTP::Tinyish can be useful in a restrictive
 environment where you need to be able to download CPAN modules without an
 HTTPS support in built-in HTTP library.
