Description: infinity note execution library (development files)
 Infinity is a platform-independent system for executables and shared
 libraries to export information to software development tools such as
 debuggers.
 .
 In Infinity, executable and shared library files contain *Infinity
 notes* in addition to their regular contents. Each Infinity note
 contains a function encoded in a platform-independent instruction
 set that note-consuming tools can load and execute.
 .
 This package contains the development files for the execution library.
