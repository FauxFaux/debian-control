Description: utilities from the iksemel library
 iksemel handles Jabber connections, parses XML, and sends and
 receives Jabber messages. It works pretty good for parsing other
 kinds of XML, too, if the need arises.
 .
 This package includes three utilitaries from the library: ikslint,
 which checks xml files for well-formedness, iksperf, which tests
 speed and memory usage, and, finally, iksroster, which backups your
 roster.
