Description: Perl extension for showing/modifying JPEG (meta)data
 This package provides an interface for reading and interpreting the
 content of JPEG segments, in particular of those segments containing
 metadata (like TIFF headers, thumbnails, Exif info, IPTC info, comments,
 etc.). Some segments can even be modified and rewritten to disk.
