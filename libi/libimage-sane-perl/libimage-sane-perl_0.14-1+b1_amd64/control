Description: Perl extension for the SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) Project
 The Image::Sane Perl bindings for the SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) Project
 allow you to access SANE-compatible scanners in a Perlish and object-oriented
 way, freeing you from the casting and memory management in C, yet remaining
 very close in spirit to original API.
