Description: multidimensional image processing library in Java
 A multidimensional, type-agnostic image processing library.
 .
 It provides an interface-driven design that supports numeric and non-
 numeric data types (8-bit unsigned integer, 32-bit floating point, etc.)
 in an extensible way. It implements several data sources and sample
 organizations, including one single primitive array, one array per
 plane, N-dimensional array "cells" cached to and from disk on demand,
 and planes read on demand from disk.
