Description: module warning about using the indirect object syntax
 When enabled (or disabled as some may prefer to say, since you actually turn
 it on by calling no indirect), the indirect pragma lexically warns about
 indirect object syntax constructs that may have slipped into your code. This
 syntax is now considered harmful, since its parsing has many quirks and its
 use is error prone (when swoosh isn't defined, swoosh $x actually compiles to
 $x->swoosh).
 .
 It currently does not warn for core functions (print, say, exec or system).
 This may change in the future, or may be added as optional features that
 would be enabled by passing options to unimport.
 .
 indirect is not a source filter.
