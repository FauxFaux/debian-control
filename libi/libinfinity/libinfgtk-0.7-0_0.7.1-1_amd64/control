Description: infinote-based collaborative editing (Gtk widgets)
 libinfinity is library to build collaborative text editors. Changes
 to the text buffers are synced to all other clients over a central server.
 Even though a central server is involved, the local user sees his changes
 applied instantly and the merging is done on the individual clients.
 .
 This package contains Gtk widgets for use in libinfinity-based and
 Gtk-based applications. It is built against Gtk3.
