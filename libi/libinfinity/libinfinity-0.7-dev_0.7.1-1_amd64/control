Description: infinote-based collaborative editing - development files
 libinfinity is library to build collaborative text editors. Changes
 to the text buffers are synced to all other clients over a central server.
 Even though a central server is involved, the local user sees his changes
 applied instantly and the merging is done on the individual clients.
 .
 This package contains the C headers of libinfinity and all files needed
 to link applications dependening on this library.
