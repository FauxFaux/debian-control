Description: Embedded InnoDB Library
 Embedded InnoDB is used independently of MySQL. It is not a plugin, nor a
 storage engine for MySQL. It is designed to be linked directly into
 application programs, and provides highly efficient, low-level database
 management services, not using SQL
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
