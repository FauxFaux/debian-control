Description: MIDI instrument editing library
 libInstPatch stands for lib-Instrument-Patch and is a library for
 processing digital sample based MIDI instrument "patch" files.
 The types of files libInstPatch supports are used for creating
 instrument sounds for wavetable synthesis. This library provides
 an object framework (based on GObject) to load patch files into,
 which can then be edited, converted, compressed and saved.
