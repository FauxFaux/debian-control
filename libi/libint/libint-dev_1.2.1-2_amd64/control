Description: Evaluate the integrals in modern atomic and molecular theory (devel)
 The LIBINT library is used to evaluate the traditional (electron repulsion)
 and certain novel two-body matrix elements (integrals) over Cartesian
 Gaussian functions used in modern atomic and molecular theory. The idea
 of the library is to let computer write optimized code for computing
 such integrals. There are two primary advantages to this: much less
 human effort is required to write code for computing new integrals, and
 code can be optimized specifically for a particular computer
 architecture (e.g., vector processor).
 .
 LIBINT has been utilized to implement methods such as Hartree-Fock (HF)
 and Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS DFT), second-order
 Moeller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), coupled cluster singles and
 doubles (CCSD) method, as well as explicitly correlated R12 methods.
 .
 This package contains the development header files.
