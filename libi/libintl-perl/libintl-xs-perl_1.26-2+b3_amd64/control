Description: Uniforum message translations system compatible i18n library
 libintl-perl is an internationalization library for Perl that aims to be
 compatible with the Uniforum message translations system as implemented for
 example in GNU gettext.
 .
 This package contains the XS Implementation of Uniforum Message Translation,
 which is, thanks to the use of C code and libraries, a little bit faster than
 the pure Perl implementation.
