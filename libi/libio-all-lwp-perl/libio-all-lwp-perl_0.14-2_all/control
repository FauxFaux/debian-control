Description: Perl module to use HTTP and FTP URLs with IO::All
 IO::All::LWP acts as glue between IO::All and LWP, so that files can
 be read and written through the network using the convenient IO:All
 interface. Note that this module is not used directly: you just use
 IO::All, which knows when to autoload IO::All::HTTP, IO::All::HTTPS,
 IO::All::FTP, or IO::All::Gopher, which implement the specific
 protocols based on IO::All::LWP.
