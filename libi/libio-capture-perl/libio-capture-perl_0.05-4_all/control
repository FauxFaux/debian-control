Description: Abstract Base Class to build modules to capture output
 The IO::Capture Module defines an abstract base class that can be
 used to build modules that capture output being sent on a filehandle
 such as STDOUT or STDERR.
 .
 Several modules that come with the distribution do just that.
 I.e., Capture STDOUT and STDERR.  Also see James Keenan's
 IO::Capture::Stdout::Extended on CPAN.
 .
 See IO::Capture::Overview for a
 discussion of these modules and examples of how to build a module to
 sub-class from IO::Capture yourself.   If after reading the overview,
 you would like to build a class from IO::Capture, look here for
 details on the internals.
