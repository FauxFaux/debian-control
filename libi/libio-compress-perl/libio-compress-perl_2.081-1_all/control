Description: bundle of IO::Compress modules
 This package contains the following IO::Compress and IO::Uncompress modules:
 .
  - Compress::Zlib
  - IO::Compress::Base
  - IO::Compress::Bzip2
  - IO::Compress::Deflate
  - IO::Compress::Gzip
  - IO::Compress::RawDeflate
  - IO::Compress::Zip
  - IO::Uncompress::Base
  - IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2
  - IO::Uncompress::Gunzip
  - IO::Uncompress::Inflate
  - IO::Uncompress::RawInflate
  - IO::Uncompress::Unzip
 .
 Compress::Zlib is a Perl external module which provides an interface to
 the info-zip zlib compression library. zlib is a general purpose
 compression library.
 .
 Some of the features provided by Compress::Zlib include:
 .
    * in-memory compression and decompression
    * read and write gzip (.gz) files directly.
 .
 IO::Compress::Bunzip2 and IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 provide a Perl interface
 that allows transparent reading and writing bzip2 compressed data to files or
 buffers.
 .
 IO::Compress::Base is the base class for all IO::Compress and IO::Uncompress
 modules. It is not intended for direct use in application code. Its sole
 purpose is to be sub-classed by IO::Compress modules.
