Description: Perl interface to the Epoll IO Multiplexing subsystem
 IO::Epoll provides access to the new, (currently) Linux-specific variant of
 poll() known as epoll(). It is designed to offer O(1) scalability over large
 numbers of watched file descriptors.
 .
 This module provides a higher-level layer designed to emulate the behaviour
 of IO::Poll and IO::Ppoll, but also exposes the corresponding low-level API
 that closely matches the related system calls.
