Description: module to pass a file descriptor over a socket
 This small low-level module only has one purpose: pass a file descriptor to
 another process, using a (streaming) unix domain socket (on POSIX systems) or
 any (streaming) socket (on WIN32 systems). The ability to pass file
 descriptors on windows is currently the unique selling point of this module.
