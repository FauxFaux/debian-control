Description: module providing helper functions for IO::Handle
 IO::Handle::Util and its copackaged modules provide various means of creating
 file handles from callbacks and by coercing objects. In particular
 IO::Handle::Prototype::Fallback allows you to define a file handle
 by implementing the various file handle functions as callacks.
 A much simpler interface is provided by IO::Handle::Iterator which reduces
 the callbacks that need to be defined to one.
