Description: object-oriented interface to select() for Perl
 IO::Multiplex is designed to take the effort out of managing
 multiple file handles.  It is essentially a really fancy front end to
 the select() system call.  In addition to maintaining the select()
 loop, it buffers all input and output to/from the file handles.  It
 can also accept incoming connections on one or more listen sockets.
