Description: module to select a pager and pipe text to it
 IO::Pager is lightweight and can be used to locate an available pager and set
 the PAGER environment variable sanely or as a factory for creating objects
 defined elsewhere such as IO::Pager::Buffered and IO::Pager::Unbuffered.
 .
 IO::Pager subclasses are designed to programmatically decide whether or not
 to pipe a filehandle's output to a program specified in PAGER. Subclasses may
 inherit from IO::Pager, and implement the IO handle methods desired.
