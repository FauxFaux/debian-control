Description: module that prompts for user input with a default option
 IO::Prompt::Tiny is an extremely simple prompting module, based on the
 extremely simple prompt offered by ExtUtils::MakeMaker.In many cases, that's
 all you need and this module gives it to you without all the overhead of
 ExtUtils::MakeMaker just to prompt for input.
 .
 It doesn't do any validation, coloring, menus, timeouts, or any of the wild,
 crazy, cool stuff that other prompting modules do. It just prompts with a
 default. That's it!
