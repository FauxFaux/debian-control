Description: module that provides non-blocking I/O streams based on EV
 Non-blocking event-based low-level I/O is hard to get right. Things become
 much worse when you need to alter I/O stream in some way - use proxies,
 encryption, SSL, etc.
 .
 IO::Stream is designed to give user ability to work with I/O streams on
 higher level, using input/output buffers (just scalars) and high-level
 events like CONNECTED, SENT or EOF. As same time it doesn't hide low-level
 things, and user still able to work on low-level without any limitations.
