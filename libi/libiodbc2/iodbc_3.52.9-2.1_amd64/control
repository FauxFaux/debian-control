Description: GTK+ config frontend for the iODBC Driver Manager
 The iODBC (intrinsic Open Database Connectivity) driver manager is compatible
 with the ODBC 2.x and 3.x specification and performs all the jobs of a
 ODBC driver manager (i.e. driver loading, parameters and function sequence
 checking, driver's function invoking, etc). Any ODBC driver working with
 ODBC 2.0 and 3.x driver manager will also work with iODBC driver manager
 and vice versa.
 .
 Applications (using ODBC function calls) linked with iODBC driver manager
 will be able to simultaneously access different types of data sources within
 one process through suitable iODBC drivers.
 .
 This package contains the configuration binaries.
