Description: Interprocess Publish/Subscribe channels
 IPC::PubSub provides a simple API for publishing messages to channels
 and for subscribing to them.
 .
 When a message is published on a channel, all subscribers currently in
 that channel will get it on their next get or get_all call.
 .
 The package includes backends based on DBM::Deep, Cache::Memcached,
 Jifty::DBI and plain hashes.
