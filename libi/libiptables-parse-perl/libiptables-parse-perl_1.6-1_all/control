Description: Perl extension for parsing iptables firewall rulesets
 The IPTables::Parse package provides an interface to parse iptables
 rules on Linux systems through the direct execution of iptables commands, or
 from parsing a file that contains an iptables policy listing.  You can get
 the current policy applied to a table/chain, look for a specific user-defined
 chain, check for a default DROP policy, or determing whether or not logging
 rules exist.
