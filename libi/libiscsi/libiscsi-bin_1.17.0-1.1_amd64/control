Description: iSCSI client shared library - utilities
 Libiscsi is a clientside library to implement the iSCSI protocol
 that can be used to access resource of an iSCSI Target.
 .
 The library is fully async with regards to iscsi commands and scsi
 tasks, but a sync layer is also provided for ease of use for simpler
 applications.
 .
 This package contains a set of useful iscsi utilities such as logging in
 to and enumerating all targets on a portal and all devices of a target,
 all built on top of libiscsi.
