Description: abstractions and Java implementations for rendering PDF
 To built a flexible PDF rendering one first needed some basics
 functionality to deal with fonts, images and general platform
 abstractions. The result is isCWT. It contains all abstraction and
 implementations needed for rendering PDF that are not related to PDF
 itself.  This library is built and used primarily for jPod Renderer,
 so one is likely to miss some features when using it in another context.
