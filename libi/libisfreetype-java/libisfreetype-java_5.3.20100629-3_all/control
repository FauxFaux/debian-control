Description: Java wrapper for FreeType font handling library
 The PDF rendering of the Open Source efforts of the company intarsys
 was in demand of a good font handling library. This new development was
 motivated by observations that current solutions
  * only have poor support for VM
  * there is no plain Java library around
  * extends the de factor standard C library FreeType
 This library wraps around the functions that were important for
 using isNativeC (another library of the same company) and were ready
 to run on all FreeType supported platforms.
 .
 While this wrapper-library binds and uses only a very small subset
 of the FreeType features available, to the degree that it is needed
 for the jPodRenderer, it should be no problem to use and enhance
 this implementation in other contexts.
 .
 This package provides a only a link to the very latest
 version of libisfreetype.
