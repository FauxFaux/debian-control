Description: helper routines to access native code from Java
 The package presents a solution completely written in Java to access
 native code.  Features:
  * Java side declaration, no C compiler
  * Clean design
  * Transparent, easy deployment
  * Platform independent
  * Fast
 The effort relies on a combination of upstream's custom design for
 the call interface, memory abstraction and data structures and the
 basic native binding provided by any third party (currently jna).
