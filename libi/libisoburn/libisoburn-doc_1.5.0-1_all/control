Description: documentation package for libisoburn
 libisoburn is a frontend for the libraries libburn and libisofs. It handles
 the creation, loading, manipulation and burning of ISO-9660 filesystem images.
 This library provides a low-level API, called libisoburn API, which
 enhances and partly encapsulates the API of libburn and libisofs. Further
 there is a higher level API, called xorriso API, which completely encapsulates
 the API of libburn, libisofs, and libisoburn. It implements all parts of
 xorriso except the small initialization module xorriso/xorriso_main.c .
 .
 This package contains the documentation for libisoburn.
