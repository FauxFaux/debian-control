Description: access of iso-codes data and translations
 This library can be used to easily access XML data of the iso-codes
 package. It will provide an abstraction layer to handle both the
 version 3 and the upcoming version 4 of iso-codes. Moreover, all
 available translations can be used as well.
 .
 This library makes use of the GObject introspection features, so that
 it is accessible from a variety of programming languages, for example
 C, Vala, Ruby, Python, Perl, Lua, JavaScript, PHP and many more.
