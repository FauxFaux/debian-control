Description: Java Library to generate PDF on the Fly
 iText is a library that allows you to generate PDF files on the fly.
 The iText classes are very useful for people who need to generate read-only,
 platform independent documents containing text, lists, tables and images.
 The library is especially useful in combination with Java(TM)
 technology-based Servlets: The look and feel of HTML is browser dependent;
 with iText and PDF you can control exactly how your servlet's output will look.
 iText requires JDK 1.2. It's available for free under a multiple license:
 MPL and LGPL.
