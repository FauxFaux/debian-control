Description: Java Library to create and manipulate PDF on the fly (documentation)
 iText is a library that allows you to generate PDF files on the fly.
 The iText classes are very useful for people who need to generate read-only,
 platform independent documents containing text, lists, tables and images.
 The library is especially useful in combination with Java(TM)
 technology-based Servlets: The look and feel of HTML is browser dependent;
 with iText and PDF you can control exactly how your servlet's output will look.
 .
 This package contains the documentation.
