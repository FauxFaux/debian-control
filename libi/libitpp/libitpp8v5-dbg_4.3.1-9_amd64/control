Description: C++ library of signal processing and communication routines: Debug symbols
 IT++ is a C++ library of mathematical, signal processing and
 communication classes and functions. Its main use is in simulation of
 communication systems and for performing research in the area of
 communications. The kernel of the library consists of generic vector
 and matrix classes, and a set of accompanying routines. Such a kernel
 makes IT++ similar to MATLAB or GNU Octave .
 .
 This package has the debugging symbols for IT++ which may
