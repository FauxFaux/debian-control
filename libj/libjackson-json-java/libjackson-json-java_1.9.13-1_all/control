Description: streaming fast powerful standard conformant json processor in java
 Jackson is a Java-based JSON-processing package that contains:
 .
  * high-performance streaming JSON parser/generator
  * Tree Model that can be built from/written to parser/generator
  * Object Mapper that implements data binding to/from
  * parser/generator
 .
 API of streaming parser/generator is similar to Stax API used for
 efficient xml processing on Java platform.
 .
 Beyond VERY fast Json parser and generator, Jackson project also offers
 full data binding support through 2 different approaches: "Object
 Mapper" for full POJO to/from Json data mapping (similar to JAXB2) and
 "Tree Mapper" for something similar to DOM and XPath.
