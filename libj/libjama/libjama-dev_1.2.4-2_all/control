Description: C++ Linear Algebra Package
 JAMA/C++ was adapted for The Template Numerical Toolkit (TNT) from
 JAMA, a Java Matrix Library, developed jointly by the Mathworks and
 NIST. See http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama for more information.
 .
 TNT is a collection of interfaces and reference implementations of
 numerical objects useful for scientific computing in C++. The toolkit
 defines interfaces for basic data structures, such as multidimensional
 arrays and sparse matrices, commonly used in numerical applications.
 The goal of this package is to provide reusable software components
 that address many of the portability and maintenance problems with C++
 codes.
 .
 TNT provides a distinction between interfaces and implementations of
 TNT components. For example, there is a TNT interface for
 two-dimensional arrays which describes how individual elements are
 accessed and how certain information, such as the array dimensions, can
 be used in algorithms; however, there can be several implementations of
 such an interface: one that uses expression templates, or one that uses
 BLAS kernels, or another that is instrumented to provide debugging
 information. By specifying only the interface, applications codes may
 utilize such algorithms, while giving library developers the greatest
 flexibility in employing optimization or portability strategies.
