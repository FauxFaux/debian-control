Description: Clojure interface to sql databases via jdbc
 This Clojure library provides a simple abstraction for CRUD (create, read,
 update, delete) operations on a SQL database, along with basic transaction
 support. Basic DDL operations are also supported (create table, drop table,
 access to table metadata).
 .
 This library was formerly known as clojure.contrib.sql.
