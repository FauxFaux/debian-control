Description: Compressed variant of the Java bitset class (documentation)
 JavaEWAH is a word-aligned compressed variant of the Java bitset class. It uses
 a 64-bit run-length encoding (RLE) compression scheme. It trades-off some
 compression for better processing speed. It also has a 32-bit version which
 compresses better, but is not as fast.
 .
 This package contains the API documentation of libjavaewah-java.
