Description: XS based JavaScript minifier
 JavaScript::Minifier::XS is a JavaScript "minifier"; its designed to remove
 un-necessary whitespace and comments from JavaScript files, while also not
 breaking the JavaScript.
 .
 JavaScript::Minifier::XS is similar in function to JavaScript::Minifier, but
 is substantially faster as its written in XS and not just pure Perl.
