Description: Java implementation of OpenBSD's Blowfish hashing
 jBCrypt is an implementation of Blowfish block cipher with modifications
 designed to raise the cost of off-line password cracking and frustrate fast
 hardware implementation.
 .
 The intent is to make a compromise of a password database less likely to
 result in an attacker gaining knowledge of the plaintext passwords (e.g. using
 John the Ripper).
