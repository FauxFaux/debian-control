Description: lightweight and fast library using XML - documentation
 JDOM is, quite simply, a Java representation of an XML document. JDOM
 provides a way to represent that document for easy and efficient
 reading, manipulation, and writing. It has a straightforward API, is
 lightweight and fast, and is optimized for the Java programmer. It's
 an alternative to DOM and SAX, although it integrates well with both
 DOM and SAX.

 This package contains API documentation (Javadoc) of libjdom1-java.
