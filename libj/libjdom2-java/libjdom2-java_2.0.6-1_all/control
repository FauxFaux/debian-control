Description: lightweight and fast library using XML
 JDOM is, quite simply, a Java representation of an XML document. JDOM
 provides a way to represent that document for easy and efficient
 reading, manipulation, and writing. It has a straightforward API, is
 lightweight and fast, and is optimized for the Java programmer. It's
 an alternative to DOM and SAX, although it integrates well with both
 DOM and SAX.
