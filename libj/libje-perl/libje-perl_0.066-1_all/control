Description: Pure-Perl ECMAScript (JavaScript) Engine
 JE is a pure-Perl ECMAScript (JavaScript) engine.
 .
 Advantages:
  - Compatible with Data::Dump::Streamer, so the runtime environment can be
    serialised
  - The parser can be extended/customised to support extra (or fewer) language
    features (not yet complete)
  - All JavaScript datatypes can be manipulated directly from Perl (they all
    have overloaded operators)
 .
 Weaknesses:
  - It's slow
  - It uses lots of memory.
  - It leaks memory (to be fixed).
 .
 This is still an alpha release, but it fully implements ECMAScript v3, except
 for a few seldom-used features like -0.
