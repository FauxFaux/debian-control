Description: mathematical graph theory library for Java
 JGraphT is a free Java graph library that provides mathematical
 graph theory objects and algorithms. JGraphT supports various types of
 graphs including:
  - directed and undirected graphs
  - graphs with weighted, unweighted, labeled or user-defined edges
  - various edge multiplicity options, including simple graphs,
    multigraphs and pseudographs
  - unmodifiable graphs: allow modules to provide "read-only" access
    to internal graphs
  - listenable graphs: allow external listeners to track modification events
  - subgraphs: graphs that are auto-updating subgraph views on other graphs
