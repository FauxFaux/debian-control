Description: Framework for binding XML data to Java objects (documentation)
 JiBX lets you work with data from XML documents using your own class
 structures. The JiBX framework handles all the details of converting
 your data to and from XML based on your instructions. JiBX is designed
 to perform the translation between internal data structures and XML
 with very high efficiency, but still allows you a high degree of
 control over the translation process.
 .
 This package contains documentation, javadocs and tutorial code for JiBX.
