Description: JIRA REST Client for automated scripts
 JIRA::Client::Automated is an adapter between any automated system and JIRA's
 REST API. JIRA::Client::Automated is explicitly designed to easily create and
 close issues within a JIRA instance via automated scripts.
 .
 For example, if you run nightly batch jobs, you can use
 JIRA::Client::Automated to have those jobs automatically create issues in
 JIRA for you when the script runs into errors. You can attach error log files
 to the issues and then they'll be waiting in someone's open issues list when
 they arrive at work the next day.
 .
 If you want to avoid creating the same issue more than once you can search
 JIRA for it first, only creating it if it doesn't exist. If it does already
 exist you can add a comment or a new error log to that issue.
