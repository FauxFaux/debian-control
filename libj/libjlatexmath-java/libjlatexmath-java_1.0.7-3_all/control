Description: Implementation of LaTeX math mode wrote in Java
 JLaTeXmath library provides a set of Java classes for displaying (complex)
 mathematical formulas as part of a Java application. Some use cases are:
  - Displaying text with embedded formulas (in an editor pane, a JavaHelp
    page, ...)
  - Make a combo box which provides the user with a choice between various
    formulas.
  - Have a slider with ticks that display their values not as decimal numbers,
    but as exact values, e.g., fractions, square roots or any combination of
    these.
  - Display the formula together with the graph of a function.
