Description: Dynamic access of native libraries from Java without JNI (native libs)
 JNA provides Java programs easy access to native shared libraries without
 writing anything but Java code - no JNI or native code is required. This
 functionality is comparable to Windows' Platform/Invoke and Python's ctypes.
 Access is dynamic at runtime without code generation.
 .
 This package contains the native libraries for libjna-java
