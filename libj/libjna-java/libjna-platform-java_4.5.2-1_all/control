Description: Dynamic access of native libraries from Java without JNI (platform extension)
 JNA provides Java programs easy access to native shared libraries without
 writing anything but Java code - no JNI or native code is required. This
 functionality is comparable to Windows' Platform/Invoke and Python's ctypes.
 Access is dynamic at runtime without code generation.
 .
 This package contains the platform library with many native functions already
 mapped as well as a set of utility interfaces that simplify native access.
