Description: Java bindings for OpenGL API (JNI lib)
 The JOGL project hosts the development version of the Java Bindings for
 OpenGL (JSR-231), and is designed to provide hardware-supported 3D graphics
 to applications written in Java. JOGL is not the official reference
 implementation of the JSR, but an evolving workspace; snapshots are taken
 from this workspace which become the official reference implementations of
 the JSR. JOGL is part of a suite of open-source technologies initiated by
 the Game Technology Group at Sun Microsystems.
 .
 JOGL provides full access to the APIs in the OpenGL 2.0 specification as
 well as nearly all vendor extensions, and integrates with the AWT and Swing
 widget sets.
