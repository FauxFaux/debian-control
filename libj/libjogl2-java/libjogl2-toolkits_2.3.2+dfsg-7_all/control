Description: Toolkits to play with JOGL2
 The JOGL project hosts the development version of the Java Bindings for
 OpenGL (JSR-231), and is designed to provide hardware-supported 3D graphics
 to applications written in Java. JOGL is not the official reference
 implementation of the JSR, but an evolving workspace; snapshots are taken
 from this workspace which become the official reference implementations of
 the JSR.
 .
 JOGL provides full access to the APIs in the OpenGL 1.3 - 3.0, 3.1 - 3.3,
 >= 4.0, ES 1.x and ES 2.x specification as well as nearly all vendor
 extensions. It integrates with the AWT and Swing widget sets, as well with
 custom windowing toolkits using the NativeWindow API. It is part of a
 suite of open-source technologies initiated by the Game Technology Group at
 Sun Microsystems.
 .
 This package includes JOGL toolkits.
