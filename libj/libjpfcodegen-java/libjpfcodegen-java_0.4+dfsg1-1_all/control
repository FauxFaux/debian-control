Description: tool for generating classes from JPF plug-ins
 JPF Code Generator is a handy little tool that generates classes for
 accessing the attributes and extensions of JPF plug-ins from plugin.xml
 files. This has the advantage of providing a strongly typed access to the
 plug-in and simplyfies working with plug-ins.
