Description: form generator from a JSON schema
 Schema Form is a set of AngularJS directives (and a couple of
 services). It can do two things to make life easier:
 1. Create a form directly from a JSON schema.
 2. Validate form fields against that same JSON schema.
 .
 Schema Form uses convention over configuration, so it comes
 packaged with some sensible defaults. But you can always
 customize it by changing the order and types of form fields.
