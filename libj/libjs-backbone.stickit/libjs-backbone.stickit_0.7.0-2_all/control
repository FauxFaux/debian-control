Description: Backbone data binding plugin that binds Model attributes to View elements
 Stickit is a Backbone data binding plugin that binds Model attributes to View
 elements with a myriad of options for fine-tuning a rich app experience.
 Unlike most model binding plugins, Stickit does not require any extra markup
 in your html; in fact, Stickit will clean up your templates, as you will need
 to interpolate fewer variables (if any at all) while rendering. In Backbone
 style, Stickit has a simple and flexible API which plugs in nicely to a View's
 lifecycle.
