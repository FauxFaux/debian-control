Description: window.fetch JavaScript polyfill
 The fetch() function is a Promise-based mechanism for programmatically making
 web requests in the browser. This project is a polyfill that implements a
 subset of the standard Fetch specification, enough to make fetch a viable
 replacement for most uses of XMLHttpRequest in traditional web applications.
