Description: fast JavaScript polyfill for img srcset
 img.srcset is a lightweight, no nonsense, all browser supporting, fast
 polyfill for img srcset, allowing for lighter yet backwards-compatible
 responsive web design.
 .
 The srcset attribute is an HTML extension for adaptive (a.k.a.
 responsive) images.  More info at <http://www.w3.org/TR/html-srcset/>.
 .
 A polyfill is (in the context of HTML5) Javascript code implementation
 of a functionality often available in modern web browsers, allowing web
 designers to use simpler standards-compliant and declarative code,
 burdening only older/simpler browsers with these fallback snippets.
