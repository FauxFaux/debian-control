Description: jQuery table sorting plugin
 Most table sorting plugins try to account for a limitless number of
 data types and their limitless ways of being presented. This leads to
 an extremely bloated code base with only a tiny portion of the code
 ever used by your project.
 .
 This plugin avoids that issue by letting you define your own ways of
 sorting table columns. The plugin internally recognizes "int",
 "string", "string-ins" (case-insensitive) and "float", so simple data
 tables will take very little effort on your part.
