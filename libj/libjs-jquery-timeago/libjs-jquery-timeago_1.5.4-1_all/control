Description: updates fuzzy timestamps
 jQuery plugin that makes it easy to support automatically updating fuzzy
 timestamps (e.g. "4 minutes ago" or "about 1 day ago") from ISO 8601
 formatted dates and times embedded in your HTML (Ã  la microformats).
 .
 Timeago was originally built for use with Yarp.com to timestamp comments.
 .
 # Avoid timestamps dated "1 minute ago" even though the page was opened 10
 minutes ago; timeago refreshes automatically.
 # You can take full advantage of page caching in your web applications,
 because the timestamps aren't calculated on the server.
 # You get to use microformats like the cool kids.
