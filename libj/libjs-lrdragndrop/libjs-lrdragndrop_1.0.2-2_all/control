Description: drag and drop module for Angularjs
 lrDragNDrop is a drag and drop module for Angularjs which allows one to drag
 items from one collection and drop to another one; or reorder the items within
 the same collection.

 It is "item oriented" which imply:
  * the directives must be used with the standard ngRepeat directive
  * "adorners" can be added
  * works only with non empty collections
