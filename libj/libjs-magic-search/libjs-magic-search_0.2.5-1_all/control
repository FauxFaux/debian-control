Description: AngularJS widget that provides a UI for faceted and text search
 MagicSearch is an AngularJS directive that provides a UI for both faceted
 filtering and as-you-type filtering. It is intended for filtering tables, such
 as an AngularJS smart-table, but it can be used in any situation where you can
 provide it with facets/options and consume its events.
