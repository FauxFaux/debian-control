Description: Lightweight plugin / dependency system for libraries
 MicroPlugin is a lightweight drop-in plugin architecture for your
 JavaScript library. Plugins can declare dependencies to other plugins
 and can be initialized with options (in a variety of formats). It is
 AMD-compatible and it works identically in Node.js and in a browser.
