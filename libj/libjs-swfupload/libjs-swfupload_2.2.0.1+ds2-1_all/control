Description: javascript library to use Flash's upload functionality
 SWFUpload is a JavaScript Library that wraps the Flash Player's upload
 function. It brings your uploads to the next level with Multiple File
 Selection, Upload Progress and Client-side File Size Checking.
 .
 Unlike other Flash upload tools, SWFUpload leaves the UI in the developer's
 hands. Using a set of event handlers developers can display upload progress
 and status to the user in their own HTML/CSS UI.
 .
 Features:
  * Multiple File Selection
  * File Upload Progress
  * Custom Limits for File Size and Number of Uploads
  * Filter by File Type ie. *.jpg
  * File Queue
  * Customize the Browse Control
  * Flash 10 Support
