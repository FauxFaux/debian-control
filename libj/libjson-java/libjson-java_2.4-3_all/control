Description: library for transforming Java objects and XML to JSON and back again
 JSON-lib is a java library for transforming beans, maps, collections,
 java arrays and XML to JSON and back again to beans and DynaBeans.
 .
 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange
 format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for
 machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the
 JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition -
 December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language
 independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of
 the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript,
 Perl, Python, and many others.  These properties make JSON an ideal
 data-interchange language.
