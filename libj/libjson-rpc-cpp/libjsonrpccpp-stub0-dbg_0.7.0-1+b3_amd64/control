Description: debugging symbols for libjsonrpccpp-stub0
 This package provides the stub generator library for the libjson-rpc-cpp
 framework. It can automatically generate full functioning C++ and JavaScript
 JSON-RPC Client classes, which are ready to use.
 .
 For JSON-RPC Server applications, this library can generate an abstract C++
 class which just has to be sub classed and implement all pure virtual methods.
 To make this possible, a interface description file (in the JSON format)
 is required, which lists all available methods with corresponding parameters
 and types.
 .
 This package contains the debugging symbols for libjsonrpccpp-common0.
