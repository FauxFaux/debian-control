Description: stub generator for libjsonrpccpp based applications
 This package provides the stub generator for the libjson-rpc-cpp framework.
 It can automatically generate full functioning C++ and JavaScript JSON-RPC
 Client classes, which are ready to use.
 .
 For JSON-RPC Server applications, this tool can generate an abstract C++ class
 which just has to be sub classed and implement all pure virtual methods. To
 make this possible, a simple interface description file (in the JSON format)
 is required, which lists all available methods with corresponding parameters
 and types.
