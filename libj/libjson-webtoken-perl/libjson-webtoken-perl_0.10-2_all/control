Description: JSON Web Token (JWT) implementation
 JSON::WebToken is an implementation of JSON Web Token (JWT) for Perl.
 .
 JSON Web Token is a JSON-based open standard for passing claims between
 parties in web application environment. The tokens are designed to be
 compact, URL-safe and usable especially in web browser single sign-on
 context. JWT claims can be typically used to pass identity of
 authenticated users between an identity provider and a service
 provider, or any other type of claims as required by business
 processes. The tokens can also be authenticated and encrypted.
