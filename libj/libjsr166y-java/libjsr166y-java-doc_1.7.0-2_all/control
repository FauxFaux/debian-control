Description: Documentation for libjsr166y-java
 Documentation for JSR166 that provides a Java framework that
 supports a style of parallel programming in which problems are
 solved by (recursively) splitting them into subtasks that
 are solved in parallel, waiting for them to complete, and
 then composing results.
 .
 Fork/Join parallelism is among the simplest and most
 effective design techniques for obtaining good parallel
 performance.  Fork/Join algorithms are parallel versions
 of familiar divide-and-conquer algorithms.
 .
 JSR166y includes a parallel computation framework:
 ForkJoinTasks and their related support classes provide a
 very efficient basis for obtaining platform-independent
 parallel speed-ups of computation-intensive operations.
 .
 This package contains javadocs for jsr166y and extra166y
 Java packages.
