Description: Helper library for the Java 5 Type
 Java 5 introduced a richer type system for generics with Type and its various
 subtypes, but lacks any easy way to perform common operations on these types.
 JType aims to fill this gap.
 .
 Features:
  - A factory to easily create implementations of the various type interfaces.
  - Methods to compare and manipulate type instances, such as checking whether
    a type is a subtype of another.
  - A generic type literal that provides an equivalent of class literals for
    types.
