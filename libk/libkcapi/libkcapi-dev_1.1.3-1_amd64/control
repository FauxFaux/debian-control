Description: Development files for Linux Kernel Crypto API
 The Linux kernel exports a Netlink interface of type AF_ALG to allow user
 space to utilize the kernel crypto API. libkcapi uses this Netlink interface
 and exports easy to use APIs so that a developer does not need to consider the
 low-level Netlink interface handling.
 .
 The library does not implement any cipher algorithms. All consumer requests
 are sent to the kernel for processing. Results from the kernel crypto API
 are returned to the consumer via the library API.
 .
 The kernel interface and therefore this library can be used by unprivileged
 processes.
 .
 This package contains development files needed to build libkcapi applications.
