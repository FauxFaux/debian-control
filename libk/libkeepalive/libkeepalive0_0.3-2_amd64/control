Description: enable tcp keepalive support in programs using shared libraries
 Many systems provide the ability to keep tcp connections alive, so they
 aren't reset by peers or by routers because of inactivity.
 .
 Even if this feature is present, only a few programs correctly implement
 the code to use it. If your favourite foo-client is not written with
 support for tcp keepalive, you'll continue to see your connection reset.
 .
 libkeepalive library provides a way to enable tcp keepalive support in
 any program that uses shared libraries (e.g.: glibc shared object) to
 perform network operations. Using the preload method, you will be able to
 intercept normal program execution and to inject the code needed to enable
 the keepalive routines, everything done without modifying the original
 binary file and with no need to gain root privileges.
