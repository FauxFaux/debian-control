Description: KDE Image Plugin Interface library -- development files
 Libkipi is a KDE library that provides a common interface for operations
 on images such as manipulation, organization, importing from and exporting
 to online services (and not only these), batch editing, etc.
 .
 These services are used in graphics applications such as gwenview, digiKam,
 kphotoalbum, and spectacle.
 .
 This package provides the development files for using the kipi library,
 and documentation for it (in the header files).
