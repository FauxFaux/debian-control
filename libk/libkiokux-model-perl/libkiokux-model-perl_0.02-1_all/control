Description: simple application specific wrapper for KiokuDB
 KiokuX::Model is a base class making it easy to create KiokuDB database
 instances in your application. It provides a standard way to
 instantiate and use a KiokuDB object in your apps.
 .
 As your app grows you can subclass it and provide additional
 convenience methods, without changing the structure of the code, but
 simply swapping your subclass for KiokuX::Model in e.g.
 Catalyst::Model::KiokuDB or whatever you use to glue it in.
