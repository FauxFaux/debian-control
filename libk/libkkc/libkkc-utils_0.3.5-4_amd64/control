Description: Japanese Kana Kanji input library - testing utility
 libkkc provides a converter from Japanese Kana-string to
 Kana-Kanji-mixed-string. It was named after kkc.el in GNU Emacs, a simple Kana
 Kanji converter, while libkkc tries to convert sentences in a bit more complex
 way using N-gram language models.
 .
 This package provides the testing utility for libkkc.
