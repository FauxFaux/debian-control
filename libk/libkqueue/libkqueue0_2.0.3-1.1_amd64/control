Description: cross-platform library for kernel event notification
 libkqueue is a portable userspace implementation of the kqueue(2)
 kernel event notification mechanism found in FreeBSD and other BSD-based
 operating systems. The library translates between the kevent structure
 and the native kernel facilities of the host machine.
