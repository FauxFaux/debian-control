Description: easily handle data structures
 Liblarch is a Python module created to easily handle data structure such as
 lists, trees and directed acyclic graphs (tree where nodes can have multiple
 parents).
 .
 Liblarch supports multiple views of one data structure and complex filtering.
 That way, you have a clear separation between your data (Model) and how they
 are displayed (View).
