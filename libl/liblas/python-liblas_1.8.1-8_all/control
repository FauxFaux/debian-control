Description: Python module to use the ASPRS LiDAR data translation library
 libLAS is a C/C++ library for reading and writing ASPRS LAS versions
 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 data. The LAS format is a sequential binary format
 used to store data from sensors and as intermediate processing storage
 by some LiDAR-related applications. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)
 is an optical remote sensing technology that measures properties of
 scattered light to find range and/or other information of a distant
 target. The prevalent method to determine distance to an object or
 surface is to use laser pulses.
 .
 This package contains a Python module to use libLAS.
