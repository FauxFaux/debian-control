Description: driver module that encapsulates the details of formatting a LaTeX document
 The LaTeX::Driver module encapsulates the details of invoking the LaTeX
 programs to format a LaTeX document. Formatting with LaTeX is complicated;
 there are potentially many programs to run and the output of those programs
 must be monitored to determine whether further processing is required.
 .
 LaTeX::Driver runs the required commands in the directory specified, either
 explicitly with the dirname option or implicitly by the directory part of
 basename, or in the current directory. As a result of the processing up to a
 dozen or more intermediate files are created. These can be removed with the
 cleanup method.
 .
 The LaTeX::Driver module takes care of running and re-running latex on
 a LaTeX document so that forward references, tables of contents, and
 lists of figures and tables are resolved.  It will also run bibtex and
 makeindex if it detects that a bibliography or in index have been
 specified, and will re-run latex again one or more times until the
 formatting of the document has stabilized.
