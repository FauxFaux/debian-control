Description: Perl module to encode characters for LaTeX formatting
 LaTeX::Encode provides a function to encode text that is to be formatted with
 LaTeX. It encodes characters that are special to LaTeX or that are
 represented in LaTeX by LaTeX commands.
 .
 The special characters are: \ (command character), { (open group), } (end
 group), & (table column separator), # (parameter specifier), % (comment
 character), _ (subscript), ^ (superscript), ~ (non-breakable space), $
 (mathematics mode).
 .
 Note that some of the LaTeX commands for characters are defined in the LaTeX
 textcomp package.
