Description: module for parsing, analyzing and manipulating LaTeX documents
 The LaTeX::TOM  module provides a parser which parses and interprets (though
 not fully) LaTeX documents and returns a tree-based representation of what it
 finds. This tree is a LaTeX::TOM::Tree. The tree contains LaTeX::TOM::Node
 nodes.
 .
 This module should be especially useful to anyone who wants to do processing
 of LaTeX documents that requires extraction of plain-text information, or
 altering of the plain-text components (or alternatively, the math-text
 components).
