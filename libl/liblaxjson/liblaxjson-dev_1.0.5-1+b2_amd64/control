Description: relaxed streaming JSON parser library (development files)
 Official JSON is almost human-readable and human-writable. Disabling a few of
 the strict rules makes it significantly more so.
 .
 This library is intended for parsing user input, such as a config file. It is
 not intended for serializing or deserializing, or as a format for computer-to-
 computer communication.
 .
 This relaxed streaming JSON parser allows:
  * unquoted keys
  * single quotes `'`
  * `//` and `/* */` style comments
  * extra commas `,` in arrays and objects
 .
 This package contains the development files.
