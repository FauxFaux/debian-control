Description: module for managing layout of graphical components
 Layout::Manager is a Perl module that provides a framework for working with
 layout managers, which are classes that determine the size and position of
 arbitrary components within a container. A few managers are provided for
 reference purposes, but this module is intended to serve as a basis for other
 implementations.
 .
 This module uses Graphics::Primitive::Container as a source of its components
 (see libgraphics-primitive-perl for details).
