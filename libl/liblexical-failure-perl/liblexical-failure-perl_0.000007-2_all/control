Description: Perl module for user-selectable lexically-scoped failure signaling
 Lexical::Failure sets up two new keywords: fail and ON_FAILURE, with which
 you can quickly create modules whose failure signaling is lexcially scoped,
 under the control of client code.
 .
 Normally, modules specify some fixed mechanism for error handling and require
 client code to adapt to that policy. One module may signal errors by
 returning undef, or perhaps some special "error object". Another may die or
 croak on failure. A third may set a flag variable. A fourth may require the
 client code to set up a callback, which is executed on failure.
 .
 If you are using all four modules, your own code now has to check for failure
 in four different ways, depending on where the failing component originated.
 If you would rather that all components throw exceptions, or all return
 undef, you will probably have to write wrappers around 3/4 of them, to
 convert from their "native" failure mechanism to your preferred one.
