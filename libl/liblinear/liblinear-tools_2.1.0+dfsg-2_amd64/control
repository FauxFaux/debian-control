Description: Standalone applications for LIBLINEAR
 LIBLINEAR is a library for learning linear classifiers for large scale
 applications. It supports Support Vector Machines (SVM) with L2 and L1
 loss, logistic regression, multi class classification and also Linear
 Programming Machines (L1-regularized SVMs). Its computational complexity
 scales linearly with the number of training examples making it one of
 the fastest SVM solvers around. It also provides Python bindings.
 .
 This package contains the standalone applications.
