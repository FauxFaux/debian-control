Description: Perl module for measuring readability of English text
 Lingua::EN::Fathom analyses English text in either a string or file. Totals
 are then calculated for the number of characters, words, sentences, blank and
 non blank (text) lines and paragraphs.
 .
 Three common readability statistics are also derived, the Fog, Flesch and
 Kincaid indices.
 .
 All of these properties can be accessed through individual methods, or by
 generating a text report.
 .
 A hash of all unique words and the number of times they occur is generated.
