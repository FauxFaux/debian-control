Description: Perl module to fix the case of people's names
 Forenames and surnames are often stored either wholly in UPPERCASE
 or wholly in lowercase. This module allows you to convert names into
 the correct case where possible.
 .
 Although forenames and surnames are normally stored separately, if they
 do appear in a single string, whitespace separated, NameCase and nc deal
 correctly with them.
 .
 NameCase currently correctly name cases names which include any of the
 following:
 Mc, Mac, al, el, ap, da, de, delle, della, di, du, del, der,
 la, le, lo, van and von.
 .
 It correctly deals with names which contain apostrophies and hyphens too.
