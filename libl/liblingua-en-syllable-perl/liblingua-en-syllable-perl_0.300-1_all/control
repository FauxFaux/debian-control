Description: module to estimate syllable count in English words
 Lingua::EN::Syllable::syllable() estimates the number of syllables in the
 English word passed to it.
 .
 Note that it isn't entirely accurate... it fails (by one syllable) for about
 10-15% of the words. The only way to get a 100% accurate count is to do a
 dictionary lookup, so this is a small and fast alternative where more-or-less
 accurate results will suffice, such as estimating the reading level of a
 document.
