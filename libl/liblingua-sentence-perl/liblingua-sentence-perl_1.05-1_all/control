Description: Perl extension for breaking text paragraphs into sentences
 Lingua::Sentence allows splitting of text paragraphs into sentences.
 It is based on scripts developed by Philipp Koehn and Josh Schroeder
 for processing the Europarl corpus <http://www.statmt.org/europarl/>.
 .
 The module uses punctuation and capitalization clues to split
 paragraphs into an newline-separated string with one sentence per line.
