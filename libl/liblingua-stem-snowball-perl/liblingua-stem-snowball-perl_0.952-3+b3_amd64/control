Description: Perl interface to Snowball stemmers
 Stemming reduces related words to a common root form. For instance, "horse",
 "horses", and "horsing" all become "hors".  Most commonly, stemming is
 deployed as part of a search application, allowing searches for a given term
 to match documents which contain other forms of that term.
 .
 This module is very similar to Lingua::Stem|Lingua::Stem -- however,
 Lingua::Stem is pure Perl, while Lingua::Stem::Snowball is an XS module which
 provides a Perl interface to the C version of the Snowball stemmers.
