Description: Stop words for several languages
 In keyword search, it is common practice to suppress a collection of
 "stopwords": words such as "the", "and", "maybe", etc. which exist in a
 large number of documents and do not tell you anything important about any
 document which contains them.  This module provides such "stoplists" in
 several languages.
