Description: list all packages on various Linux distributions
 Linux::Distribution::Packages is a simple module that uses
 Linux::Distribution to guess the Linux distribution and then uses the
 correct commands to list all the packages on the system and then output
 them in one of three formats: native, csv, and xml.
 .
 Distributions currently working: Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Redhat, Suse,
 Gentoo, Slackware, Redflag.
 .
 The module inherits from Linux::Distribution, so can also use its calls.
