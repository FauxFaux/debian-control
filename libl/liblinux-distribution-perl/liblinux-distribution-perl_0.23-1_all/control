Description: module for detecting the running Linux distribution
 Linux::Distribution is a simple module that tries to guess on what Linux
 distribution it is running by looking for release's files in /etc. It now
 looks for 'lsb-release' first as that should be the most correct and adds
 ubuntu support. Secondly, it will look for the distro specific files.
