Description: interface to Linux ioprio_set(2) and ioprio_get(2)
 Linux::IO_Prio is a perl module which provides access to the Linux
 functions ioprio_get(2) and ioprio_set(2). There are also ionice
 functions providing slightly more convenient perlish interface than the
 C API.
 .
 Currently only Linux is supported. Other operating systems are not
 supported due to kernel limitations. However support will be added as
 the kernel capability becomes available.
