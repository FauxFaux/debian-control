Description: Perl module to generate more sophisticated lists than just $a..$b
 The List::Maker module hijacks Perl's built-in file globbing syntax (< *.pl >
 and glob '*.pl') and retargets it at list creation.
 .
 The rationale is simple: most people rarely if ever glob a set of files, but
 they have to create lists in almost every program they write. So the list
 construction syntax should be easier than the filename expansion syntax.
 .
 Alternatively, you can load the module with an explicit name, and it creates
 a subroutine of that name that builds the same kinds of lists for you
 (leaving the globbing mechanism unaltered).
