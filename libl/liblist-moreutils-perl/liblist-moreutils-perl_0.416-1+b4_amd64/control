Description: Perl module with additional list functions not found in List::Util
 List::MoreUtils provides some trivial but commonly needed functionality on
 lists which is not going to go into List::Util.
 .
 All of the functions are implementable in only a couple of lines of Perl
 code. Using the functions from this module however should give slightly better
 performance as everything is implemented in C. The pure-Perl implementation of
 these functions only serves as a fallback in case the C portions of this module
 could not be compiled on this machine.
