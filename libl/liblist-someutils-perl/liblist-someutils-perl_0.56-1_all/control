Description: module that provides the stuff missing in List::Util
 List::SomeUtils provides some trivial but commonly needed functionality on
 lists which is not going to go into List::Util.
 .
 All of the functions are implementable in only a couple of lines of Perl code.
 Using the functions from this module however should give slightly better
 performance as everything is implemented in C. The pure-Perl implementation of
 these functions only serves as a fallback in case the C portions of this
 module couldn't be compiled on this machine.
