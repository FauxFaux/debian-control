Description: multimedia RTSP streaming library (development files)
 The live555.com streaming media code is a set of C++ libraries for multimedia
 streaming, using open standard protocols (RTP/RTCP, RTSP, SIP). These
 libraries can be used to build applications to stream, receive and process
 MPEG, H.263+ or JPEG video, several audio codecs, and can easily be extended
 to support additional codecs. They can also be used to build basic RTSP (Real
 Time Streaming Protocol) or SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) clients and
 servers.
 .
 This package contains the headers and static libraries required to build
 applications that use live555.com.
