Description: multimedia RTSP streaming library
 The live555.com streaming media code is a set of C++ libraries for multimedia
 streaming, using open standard protocols (RTP/RTCP, RTSP, SIP). These
 libraries can be used to build applications to stream, receive and process
 MPEG, H.263+ or JPEG video, several audio codecs, and can easily be extended
 to support additional codecs. They can also be used to build basic RTSP (Real
 Time Streaming Protocol) or SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) clients and
 servers.
 .
 This package contains the liveMedia library which defines a class hierarchy -
 rooted in the "Medium" class - for a variety of streaming media types and
 codecs.
