Description: multimedia RTSP streaming library (UsageEnvironment classes)
 The live555.com streaming media code is a set of C++ libraries for multimedia
 streaming, using open standard protocols (RTP/RTCP, RTSP, SIP). These
 libraries can be used to build applications to stream, receive and process
 MPEG, H.263+ or JPEG video, several audio codecs, and can easily be extended
 to support additional codecs. They can also be used to build basic RTSP (Real
 Time Streaming Protocol) or SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) clients and
 servers.
 .
 This package contains the UsageEnvironment library. The "UsageEnvironment" and
 "TaskScheduler" classes are used for scheduling deferred events, for assigning
 handlers for asynchronous read events, and for outputting error/warning
 messages. Also, the "HashTable" class defines the interface to a generic hash
 table, used by the rest of the code.
 .
 These are all abstract base classes; they must be subclassed for use in an
 implementation. These subclasses can exploit the particular properties of the
 environment in which the program will run - e.g., its GUI and/or scripting
 environment.
