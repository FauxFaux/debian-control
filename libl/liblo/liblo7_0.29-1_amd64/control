Description: Lightweight OSC library
 LibLO is a lightweight, easy to use implementation of the OSC (Open
 Sound Control) protocol (see
 <http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/OpenSoundControl/> for details).
 .
 Open Sound Control (OSC) is a protocol for communication among
 computers, sound synthesizers, and other multimedia devices that is
 optimized for modern networking technology. OSC features:
 .
  * Open-ended, dynamic, URL-style symbolic naming scheme
  * Symbolic and high-resolution numeric argument data
  * Pattern matching language to specify multiple recipients of a
    single message
  * High resolution time tags
  * "Bundles" of messages whose effects must occur simultaneously
  * Query system to dynamically find out the capabilities of an OSC
    server and get documentation
