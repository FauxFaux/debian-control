Description: Maketext from already interpolated strings
 Locale::Maketext::Fuzzy is a subclass of Locale::Maketext, with additional
 support for localizing messages that already contains interpolated variables.
 This is most useful when the messages are returned by external modules -- for
 example, to match "dir: command not found" against "[_1]: command not found".
