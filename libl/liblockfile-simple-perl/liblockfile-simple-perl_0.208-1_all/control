Description: Perl module for simple advisory file locking
 The LockFile::Simple extension provides simple file locking, of
 the advisory kind, i.e. it requires cooperation between applications
 wishing to lock the same files.
 .
 It is meant to be used in quick-and-dirty scripts or more elaborated
 programs that want a simple locking scheme, yet with a reasonable
 level of configuration.
