Description: extension for Log::Agent providing an application-level logging API
 The Log::Agent::Logger class defines a generic interface for
 application logging. It must not be confused with the interface
 provided by Log::Agent, which is meant to be used by re-usable
 modules that do not wish to commit on a particular logging method,
 so that they remain true building blocks.
