Description: module to send Log::Any logs to a subroutine
 Log::Any::Adapter::Callback lets you specify callback subroutine to be called
 by Log::Any's logging methods (like $log->debug(), $log->error(), etc) and
 detection methods (like $log->is_warning(), $log->is_fatal(), etc.).
 .
 This adapter is used for customized logging, and is mostly a convenient
 construct to save a few lines of code. You could achieve the same effect by
 creating a full Log::Any adapter class.
