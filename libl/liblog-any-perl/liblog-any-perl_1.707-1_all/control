Description: Perl module to log messages safely and efficiently
 Log::Any allows CPAN modules to safely and efficiently log messages, while
 letting the application choose (or decline to choose) a logging mechanism
 such as Log::Dispatch or Log::Log4perl.
 .
 Log::Any has a very tiny footprint and no dependencies beyond Perl 5.6, which
 makes it appropriate for even small CPAN modules to use. It defaults to
 'null' logging activity, so a module can safely log without worrying about
 whether the application has chosen (or will ever choose) a logging mechanism.
 .
 The application, in turn, may choose one or more logging mechanisms via
 Log::Any::Adapter.
