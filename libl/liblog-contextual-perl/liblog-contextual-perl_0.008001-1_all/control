Description: module for simple contextual logging
 Log::Contextual is a Perl module that provides an implementation-independent
 interface for simple data logging. It supports painless switching between any
 logger that implements the defined interface, either for the entire program
 (using set_logger) or for a given section of code (using with_logger).
 .
 The framework supports many logging levels that are enabled using environment
 variables (these are, in order of decreasing verbosity: trace, debug, info,
 warn, error, and fatal).
 .
 This package includes simple loggers that can be seamlessly upgraded to more
 advanced loggers, such as Log::Dispatchouli (see liblog-dispatchouli-perl).
