Description: module to log to files that archive/rotate themselves
 Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate functions similarly to
 Log::Dispatch::FileRotate, but uses File::Write::Rotate as backend, thus
 interoperates more easily with other modules which use File::Write::Rotate as
 backend, e.g. Tie::Handle::FileWriteRotate or Process::Govern.
