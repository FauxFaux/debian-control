Description: log events to Message::Passing
 Log::Dispatch::Message::Passing provides a Log::Dispatch log output
 system that sends logged events to Message::Passing.
 .
 This allows you to use any of the Message::Passing outputs or filters
 to process log events and send them across the network, and you can use
 the toolkit to trivially construct a log aggregator.
