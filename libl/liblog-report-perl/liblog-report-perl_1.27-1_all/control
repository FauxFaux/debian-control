Description: Perl module to report problems, with pluggable handlers and language support
 Handling messages to users can be a hassle, certainly when the same module is
 used for command-line and in a graphical interfaces, and has to cope with
 internationalization at the same time; this set of modules tries to
 simplify this.
 .
 Log::Report combines gettext features with Log::Dispatch-like features.
 However, you can also use this module to do only translations or only
 message dispatching.
 .
 Includes extension modules for integration with Dancer, Dancer2,
 DBIx::Class, Log::Dispatch, Log::Log4perl, and Mojolicious.
 To use either of those, please install corresponding package.
