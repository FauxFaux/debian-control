Description: Perl module to provide a unified approach to tracing
 A module to provide a unified approach to tracing. A script can use Log::Trace
 qw( < mode > ) to set the behaviour of the TRACE function.
 .
 By default, the trace functions are exported to the calling package only. You
 can export the trace functions to other packages with the "Deep" option. See
 "OPTIONS" for more information.
 .
 All exports are in uppercase (to minimise collisions with "real" functions).
