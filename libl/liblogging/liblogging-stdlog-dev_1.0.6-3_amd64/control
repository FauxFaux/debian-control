Description: easy to use and lightweight logging library - development files
 Liblogging consists of several components with stdlog being the core
 component. Think of liblogging-stdlog as the next version of the
 syslog(3) API. It retains the simple semantics, but makes the API more
 sophisticated "behind the scenes" with better support for multiple
 threads and flexibility for different log destinations.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
