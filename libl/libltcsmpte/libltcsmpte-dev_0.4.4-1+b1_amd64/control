Description: Development files for libltcsmpte
 Linear (or Longitudinal) Timecode (LTC) is an encoding of SMPTE timecode data
 as a Manchester-Biphase encoded audio signal. The audio signal is commonly
 recorded on a VTR track or other storage media.
 libltcsmpte provides functionality to both encode and decode LTC from/to SMPTE
 and can perform framerate conversion tasks.
