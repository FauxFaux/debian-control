Description: Turn a Lucene query into a Perl data structure
 This module parses a Lucene query. It deals with fields, types, phrases,
 subqueries, and so on; everything handled by the SimpleQuery class in
 Lucene. The data structure is similar to the one given above, and is
 pretty self-explanatory.
 .
 The other function, deparse_query turns such a data structure back into
 a Lucene query string. This is useful if you've just been mucking about
 with the data.
