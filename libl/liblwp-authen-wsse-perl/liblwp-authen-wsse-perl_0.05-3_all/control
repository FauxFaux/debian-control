Description: library for enabling X-WSSE authentication in LWP
 LWP::Authen::Wsse allows LWP to authenticate against servers that are using
 the X-WSSE authentication scheme, as required by the Atom Authentication API.
 .
 The module is used indirectly through LWP, rather than including it directly in
 your code.  The LWP system will invoke the WSSE authentication when it
 encounters the authentication scheme while attempting to retrieve a URL from a
 server.
