Description: module to guess media type for a file or a URL
 LWP::MediaTypes provides functions for handling media (also known as MIME)
 types and encodings. The mapping from file extensions to media types is
 defined by the media.types file. If the ~/.media.types file exists it is used
 instead. For backwards compatibility it will also look for ~/.mime.types.
