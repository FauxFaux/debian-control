Description: override LWP's HTTP/HTTPS backend with your own PSGI application
 PSGI is a specification to decouple web server environments from web
 application framework code.
 .
 LWP::Protocol::PSGI is a module to hijack *any* code that uses
 LWP::UserAgent underneath such that any HTTP or HTTPS requests can be
 routed to your own PSGI application.
 .
 Because it works with any code that uses LWP, you can override various
 WWW::*, Net::* or WebService::* modules such as WWW::Mechanize, without
 modifying the calling code or its internals.
