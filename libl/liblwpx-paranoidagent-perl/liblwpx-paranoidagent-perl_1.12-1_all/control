Description: "paranoid" subclass of LWP::UserAgent
 The LWPx::ParanoidAgent is a class subclassing LWP::UserAgent, but
 paranoid against attackers. It's to be used when a remote resource is
 fetched on behalf of a possibly malicious user.
 .
 This class can do whatever LWP::UserAgent can (callbacks, uploads
 from files, etc).
 .
 Proxy support has been removed, because in that case you should do
 your paranoia at your proxy.
 .
 The URI scheme are limited to http and https.
