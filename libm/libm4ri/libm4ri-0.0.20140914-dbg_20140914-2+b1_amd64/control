Description: debugging symbols for libm4ri-0.0.20140914
 M4RI is a library for fast arithmetic with dense matrices over F2.
 The name M4RI comes from the first implemented algorithm: The "Method
 of the Four Russians" inversion algorithm. This algorithm in turn is
 named after the "Method of the Four Russians" multiplication
 algorithm which is probably better referred to as Kronrod's method.
 .
