Description: maa programming library
 The libmaa library provides many low-level data structures which are
 helpful for writing compilers, including hash tables, sets, lists,
 debugging support, and memory management.  Although libmaa was designed
 and implemented as a foundation for the kheperalong, the data structures
 are generally applicable to a wide range of programming problems.
 .
 The memory management routines are especially helpful for improving the
 performance of memory-intensive applications.
