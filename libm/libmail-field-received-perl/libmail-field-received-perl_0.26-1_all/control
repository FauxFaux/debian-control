Description: mostly RFC822-compliant parser of Received headers
 Don't use this class directly!  Instead ask Mail::Field for new
 instances based on the field name!
 .
 Mail::Field::Received provides subroutines for parsing Received
 headers from e-mails.  It mostly complies with RFC822, but deviates to
 accommodate a number of broken MTAs which are in common use.  It also
 attempts to extract useful information which MTAs often embed within
 the (comments).
 .
 It is a subclass derived from the Mail::Field and Mail::Field::Generic
 classes.
