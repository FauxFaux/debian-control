Description: Perl extension for validating email addresses
 Mail::RFC822::Address validates email addresses against the grammar described
 in RFC 822 using regular expressions.  How to validate a user supplied email
 address is a FAQ (see perlfaq9): the only sure way to see if a supplied email
 address is genuine is to send an email to it and see if the user receives it.
 The one useful check that can be performed on an address is to check that the
 email address is syntactically valid.  That is what this module does.
 .
 This module is functionally equivalent to RFC::RFC822::Address, but uses
 regular expressions rather than the Parse::RecDescent parser.  This means that
 startup time is greatly reduced making it suitable for use in transient scripts
 such as CGI scripts.
