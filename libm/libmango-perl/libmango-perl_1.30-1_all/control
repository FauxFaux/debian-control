Description: Pure-Perl non-blocking I/O MongoDB client
 Mango is a pure-Perl non-blocking I/O MongoDB client, optimized for use with
 the Mojolicious real-time web framework, and with multiple event loop
 support.
 .
 To learn more about MongoDB you should take a look at the official
 documentation|http://docs.mongodb.org.
 .
 Note that this whole distribution is EXPERIMENTAL and will change without
 warning!
 .
 Many features are still incomplete or missing, so you should wait for a
 stable 1.0 release before using any of the modules in this distribution in a
 production environment. Unsafe operations are not supported, so far this is
 considered a feature.
