Description: Library for connecting data signals on a shared network
 libmapper is a cross-platform software library for declaring data
 signals on a shared network and enabling arbitrary connections to be
 made between them. It creates a distributed mapping system/network, with
 no central points of failure, the potential for tight collaboration and
 easy parallelization of media synthesis.
 .
 The main focus of libmapper development is to provide tools for
 creating and using systems for interactive control of media synthesis.
 .
 This package contains SWIG generated Python bindings.
