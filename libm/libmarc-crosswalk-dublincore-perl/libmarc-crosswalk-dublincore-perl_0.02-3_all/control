Description: Convert data between MARC and Dublin Core
 MARC::Crosswalk::DublinCore provides an implentation of the LOC's spec
 on how to convert metadata between MARC and Dublin Core format. The spec
 for converting MARC to Dublin Core is available at:
 http://www.loc.gov/marc/marc2dc.html, and from DC to MARC:
 http://www.loc.gov/marc/dccross.html.
 .
 NB: The conversion cannot be done in a round-trip manner. i.e. Doing a
 conversion from MARC to DC, then trying to go back to MARC will not yield the
 original record.
