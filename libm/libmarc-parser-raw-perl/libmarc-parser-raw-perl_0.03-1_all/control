Description: parser for ISO 2709 encoded MARC records
 MARC::Parser::RAW is a lightweight, fault tolerant parser for ISO 2709
 encoded MARC records.  Tags, indicators and subfield codes are not
 validated against the MARC standard.  Record length from leader and
 field lengths from the directory are ignored.  Records with a faulty
 structure will be skipped with a warning.  The resulting data structure
 is optimized for usage with the Catmandu data toolkit.
