Description: Perl extension to manipulate MAchine Readable Cataloging records
 MARC.pm is a Perl 5 module for reading in, manipulating, and outputting
 bibliographic records in the USMARC format.
 .
 MARC.pm can handle both single and batches of MARC records. The limit on
 the number of records in a batch is determined by the memory capacity of
 the machine you are running. If memory is an issue for you MARC.pm will
 allow you to read in records from a batch gradually. MARC.pm also includes
 a variety of tools for searching, removing, and even creating records from
 scratch.
