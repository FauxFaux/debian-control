Description: Perl library to access MARC data encoded as XML
 MARC::XML is an extension to the Marc::Record distribution for working with
 MARC21 data that is encoded as XML. The XML encoding used is the MARC21slim
 schema supplied by the Library of Congress. Installing MARC-XML automatically
 adds support for the additional file format for use with MARC::Batch.
