Description: XS backend for match::simple
 match::simple::XS is a faster XS-based implementation of match::simple.
 .
 Depending on what sort of matches done, it is likely to be several
 times faster. In extreme cases, such as matching a string in an
 arrayref, it can be twenty-five times faster, or more. However, where
 $that is a single regexp, it's around 30% slower.
 .
 Overall though, the performance improvement should be worthwhile.
