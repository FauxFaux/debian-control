Description: Perl module for the solution of Bezier Curves
 Math::Bezier implements the algorithm for the solution of Bezier curves as
 presented by Robert D. Miller in Graphics Gems V, "Quick and Simple Bezier
 Curve Drawing".
 .
 A new Bezier curve is created using the new() constructor, passing a list of
 (x, y) control points.
 .
  use Math::Bezier;
  my @control = ( 0, 0, 10, 20, 30, -20, 40, 0 );
  my $bezier = Math::Bezier->new(@control);
 .
 Alternately, a reference to a list of control points may be passed.
