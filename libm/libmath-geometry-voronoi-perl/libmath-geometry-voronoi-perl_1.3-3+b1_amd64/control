Description: Perl module to compute Voronoi diagrams from sets of points
 Math::Geometry::Voronoi computes Voronoi diagrams from a set of input points.
 This module is a wrapper around a C implementation by Steve Fortune, the
 inventor of the algorithm used (Fortune's algorithm), that was further
 modified by Derek Bradley.
