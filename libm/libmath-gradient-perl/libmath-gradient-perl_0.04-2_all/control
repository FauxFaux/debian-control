Description: module for calculating smooth numerical transitions
 Math::Gradient is a Perl module that is useful for calculating numbers needed
 to make smooth transitions between two or more numerical values (graphically
 represented as gradients). The primary intent of this module is to make it
 easy to mix colours, both in terms of basic and multiple-point gradients.
