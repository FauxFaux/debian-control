Description: Perl module for no carry arithmetic
 The perl module Math::NoCarry implememnts no carry arithmetic which
 doesn't allow you to carry digits to the next column.  For example,
 if you add 8 and 4, you normally expect the answer to be 12, but that
 1 digit is a carry.  In no carry arithmetic you can't do that, so the
 sum of 8 and 4 is just 2.  In effect, this is addition modulo 10 in
 each column. The following example discards all of the carry digits:
 .
  1234
  + 5678
  ------
  6802
 .
 For multiplication, the result of pair-wise multiplication
 of digits is the modulo 10 value of their normal, everyday
 multiplication.
