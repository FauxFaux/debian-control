Description: Perl5 module with commonly needed Maths and Stats functions
 This module is a collection of commonly needed number-related functions,
 including numerous standard statistical, geometric, and probability
 functions. Some of these functions are taken directly from _Mastering
 Algorithms with Perl_, by Jon Orwant, Jarkko Hietaniemi, and John
 Macdonald, and others are adapted heavily from same.
