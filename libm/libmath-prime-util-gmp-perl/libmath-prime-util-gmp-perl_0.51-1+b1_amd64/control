Description: utilities related to prime numbers, using GMP
 Math::Prime::Util::GMP contains a set of utilities related to prime numbers,
 using GMP. This includes primality tests, getting primes in a range, and
 factoring.
 .
 While it certainly can be used directly, the main purpose of this module is
 for Math::Prime::Util. That module will automatically load this if it is
 installed, greatly speeding up many of its operations on big numbers.
 .
 Inputs and outputs for big numbers are via strings, so you do not need to use
 a bigint package in your program. However if you do use bigints, inputs will
 be converted internally so there is no need to convert before a call. Output
 results are returned as either Perl scalars (for native-size) or strings (for
 bigints). Math::Prime::Util tries to reconvert all strings back into the
 callers bigint type if possible, which makes it more convenient for
 calculations.
