Description: Perl interface to the ISAAC PRNG Algorithm
 Math::Random::ISAAC implements the ISAAC (Indirection, Shift, Accumulate, Add
 and Count) pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) algorithm described on the
 project page at: <URL:http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaac.html>
 .
 As with other algorithms like the Mersenne Twister (see Math::Random::MT),
 this algorithm is designed to take some seed information and produce seemingly
 random results as output.
 .
 The results are uniformly distributed, unbiased, and unpredictable unless you
 know the seed. The algorithm was published by Bob Jenkins in the late 1990s
 and despite the best efforts of many security researchers, no feasible attacks
 have been found to date.
 .
 For comparison with other algorithms intended to generate random data, the
 Mersenne Twister has a period of 2^19937-1, the related TT800 has a period
 of 2^800-1 values. ISAAC has a period of 2^8295 values on average.
