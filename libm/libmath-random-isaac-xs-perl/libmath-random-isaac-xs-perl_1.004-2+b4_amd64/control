Description: Perl implementation of the ISAAC PRNG (C/XS Accelerated)
 Math::Random::ISAAC::XS implements the same interface as Math::Random::ISAAC
 and can be used as a drop-in replacement. This is the recommended version of
 the module, based on Bob Jenkins' reference implementation in C as described
 in his paper at: <URL:http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaac.html>
 .
 If you install this package, then any code that uses Math::Random::ISAAC will
 automagically benefit from this faster implementation. Performance increases
 are somewhere on the order of 400-500%.
