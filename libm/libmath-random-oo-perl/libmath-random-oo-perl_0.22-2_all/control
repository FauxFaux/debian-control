Description: consistent object-oriented interface for generating random numbers
 CPAN contains many modules for generating random numbers in various ways and
 from various probability distributions using pseudo-random number generation
 algorithms or other entropy sources. (The /"SEE ALSO" section has some
 examples.) Unfortunately, no standard interface exists across these modules.
 Math::Random::OO defines an abstract interface for random number generation.
 Subclasses of this model will implement specific types of random number
 generators or will wrap existing random number generators.
 .
 This consistency will come at the cost of some efficiency, but will enable
 generic routines to be written that can manipulate any provided random number
 generator that adheres to the interface. E.g., a stochastic simulation could
 take a number of user-supplied parameters, each of which is a
 Math::Random::OO subclass object and which represent a stochastic variable
 with a particular probability distribution.
