Description: Perl collection of random number generators
 Math::Random is a Perl port of the C version of randlib, which is a suite of
 routines for generating random deviates. This supports all the distributions
 from which the Fortran and C versions generate deviates. Some features are
 excluded including the multiple generators/splitting facility and antithetic
 random number generation. These, along with some of the distributions which
 are included, are probably not of interest except to the very sophisticated
 user.
