Description: cryptographically-secure, cross-platform replacement for rand()
 Math::Random::Secure is intended to provide a cryptographically-secure
 replacement for Perl's built-in rand function.
 .
 "Crytographically secure", in this case, means that: nobody can guess the
 future number, there are so many possible seeds that it would take millenia
 for an attacker to try them all.
