Description: collection of useful mathematical functions not in Perl
 Math::Utils is a broad collection of useful mathematical functions not
 available in core perl. In addition to general-purpose functions such
 as log10(), log2(), floor() or fsum(), there are generators to create
 comparison functions for floating point (non-integer) numbers as well
 as some polynomial operations on plain lists of coefficients.
