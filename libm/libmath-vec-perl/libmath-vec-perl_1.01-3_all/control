Description: Object-Oriented Vector Math Methods in Perl
 This module was adapted from Math::Vector, written by Wayne M. Syvinski.
 .
 It uses most of the same algorithms, and currently preserves the same
 names as the original functions, though some aliases have been added to
 make the interface more natural.
 .
 The "object" for the object oriented calling style is a blessed array
 reference which contains a vector of the form [x,y,z].  Methods will
 typically return a list.
