Description: module providing some basic numeric stats on vectors
 Math::VecStat provides some basic statistics on numerical vectors.
 All the subroutines can take a reference to the vector to be operated on.
 In some cases a copy of the vector is acceptable, but is not recommended
 for efficiency.
