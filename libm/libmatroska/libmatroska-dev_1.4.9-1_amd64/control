Description: extensible open standard audio/video container format (development files)
 Matroska is aiming to become the standard of Multimedia
 Container Formats one day. It is based on EBML (Extensible Binary
 Meta Language), a kind of binary version of XML. This way the
 significant advantages in terms of future format extensibility
 are gained without breaking file support in old parsers.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static libraries needed to
 compile applications that use libmatroska.
