Description: extensible open standard audio/video container format (shared library)
 Matroska is aiming to become the standard of Multimedia
 Container Formats one day. It is based on EBML (Extensible Binary
 Meta Language), a kind of binary version of XML. This way the
 significant advantages in terms of future format extensibility
 are gained without breaking file support in old parsers.
 .
 This package contains the shared library needed to run applications that
 use libmatroska.
