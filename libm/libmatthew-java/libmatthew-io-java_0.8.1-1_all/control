Description: Extra IO library for Java
 This library provides extensions to the Java I/O subsystem. Firstly, there is
 a class which will connect any InputStream with an OutputStream and copies data
 between them.
 .
 Secondly there are two classes for inserting into an Input or OutputStream pipe
 a command line command, so that everything is piped through that command.
 .
 Thirdly there are a pair of classes for splitting streams in two. This can
 either be to two OuputStreams, or to an OutputStream and a file.
 Equivelent to the UNIX tool tee in UNIX pipes.
