Description: embeddable mawk lib
 Libmawk is a fork of the popular awk implementation mawk, and aims to be
 the lightweight script language programmers embed in their application.
 .
 This implementation also supports some minor extensions over mawk:
  - dynamic awk function calls from awk scripts (by name in string)
  - dynamic variables (access variable by name in string)
  - include "scriptname.awk"
 .
 Besides the shared object, an lmawk binary is also installed, which is
 command-line-compatible with mawk but provides all those extra features.
