Description: Many-Core Engine for Perl providing parallel processing capabilities
 Many-core Engine (MCE) for Perl helps enable a new level of performance
 by maximizing all available cores. MCE spawns a pool of workers and
 therefore does not fork a new process per each element of data. Instead,
 MCE follows a bank queuing model. Imagine the line being the data and
 bank-tellers the parallel workers. MCE enhances that model by adding the
 ability to chunk the next n elements from the input stream to the next
 available worker.
 .
 Chunking and input data are optional in MCE. One may use MCE to run many
 workers in parallel without specifying input data.
