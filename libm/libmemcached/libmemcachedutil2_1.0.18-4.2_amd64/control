 A few notes on its design:
 .
   * Synchronous and Asynchronous support.
   * Access to large object support.
   * Local replication.
   * TCP and Unix Socket protocols.
   * A half dozen or so different tuneable hash algorithms.
   * Implementations of the new cas, replace, and append operators.
   * Man pages written up on entire API.
   * Implements both modulo and consistent hashing solutions.
   * Tools to Manage your Memcached networks.
