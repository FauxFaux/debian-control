Description: library to support DNA string matching and comparative genomics
 libMems is a freely available software development library to support DNA
 string matching and comparative genomics. Among other things, libMems
 implements an algorithm to perform approximate multi-MUM and multi-MEM
 identification. The algorithm uses spaced seed patterns in conjunction
 with a seed-and-extend style hashing method to identify matches. The method
 is efficient, requiring a maximum of only 16 bytes per base of the largest
 input sequence, and this data can be stored externally (i.e. on disk) to
 further reduce memory requirements.
 .
 This package contains the dynamic library.
