Description: module to create method aliases
 The traditional way to create a method alias (provide an alternate
 name for a method) is simply a GLOB alias.  While this works fine for
 functions, it does not work for methods overloaded by a subclass.
 .
 Instead, Method::Alias creates a number of methods in the caller's
 package to call the real method. It is designed to be used as a pragma,
 to which you provide a set of pairs of method names.
