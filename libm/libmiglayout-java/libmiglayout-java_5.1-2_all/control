Description: Java Layout Manager
 MiGLayout is a superbly versatile SWT/Swing layout manager that makes
 layout problems trivial. It is using String or API type-checked
 constraints to format the layout. MiGLayout can produce flowing, grid
 based, absolute (with links), grouped and docking layouts. MiGLayout
 is created to be to manually coded layouts what Matisse/GroupLayout
 is to IDE supported visual layouts.
