Description: Base32 encoder/decoder
 Similar to Base64, Base32 encodes arbitrary (binary) data in ASCII text.  The
 difference to Base64 is that Base32 encoding is case insensitive.
 .
 Base32 is defined in rfc3548 using the characters [A-Z2-7], but this module
 by default uses [0-9A-V] for compatibility with older versions of
 MIME::Base32.  An RFC compliant mode is also provided, though.
