Description: Perl interface to deal with RFC 2047 encoded words
 MIME::EncWords is a module providing several utilities to encode and decode
 arbitrary text in RFC 2047 (formerly RFC 1522) format. The MIME standard gives
 users the ability to represent any characters in any character set by using
 special sequences like:
 .
  =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Keld_J=F8rn_Simonsen?=
 .
 There are various modules available to manipulate these special character
 sequences. This module bears most resemblance to the MIME::Words module and
 provides a similar interface, providing for relatively painless upgrading,
 while having stricter conformance to the aforementioned RFCs. It provides
 more flexibility than MIME::WordDecoder because characters can be mapped
 into any desired encoding, rather than simply the local system representation.
