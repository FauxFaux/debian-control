Description: MNI medical image format development environment
 This package contains the library and headers for libminc2 and
 libminc_io.
 .
 The Minc file format is a highly flexible medical image file format.
 Minc version 1 is built on top of the NetCDF generalized data format.
 Minc version 2 is built on top of the HDF data format.  This library
 handles both formats.  In each case the format is
 simple, self-describing, extensible, portable and N-dimensional, with
 programming interfaces for both low-level data access and high-level
 volume manipulation. On top of the libraries is a suite of generic
 image-file manipulation tools. The format, libraries and tools are
 designed for use in a medical-imaging research environment : they are
 simple and powerful and make no attempt to provide a pretty interface
 to users.
