Description: minimal INI file parser - development headers
 minIni is a programmer's library to read and write "INI" files in embedded
 systems. minIni takes little resources, has a deterministic memory footprint
 and can be configured for various kinds of file I/O libraries. The principal
 purpose for minIni is to be used on embedded systems that run on an RTOS (or
 even without any operating system). minIni requires that such a system provides
 a kind of storage and file I/O system, but it does not require that this file
 I/O system is compatible with the standard C/C++ library.
 .
 This package contains the development headers.
