Description: minimal Java logging library
 MinLog is a Java logging library. Key features:
  * Zero overhead Logging statements below a given level can
    be automatically removed by javac at compile time.
    This means applications can have detailed trace and debug logging
    without having any impact on the finished product.
  * Simple and efficient The API is concise and the code is
    very efficient at runtime.
  * Extremely lightweight The entire project consists of a single Java file
    with ~100 non-comment lines of code.
