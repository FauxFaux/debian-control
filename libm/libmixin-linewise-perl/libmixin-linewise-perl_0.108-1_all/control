Description: module to handle general file input/output operations
 Mixin::Linewise is a Perl module that provides a generalized framework for
 handling input/output operations. It can open files for I/O, convert strings
 to handle type objects, and more.
 .
 With Reader and Writer classes, you can just write a method to manipulate
 normal handles, and let the modules do the rest, like providing string and
 filename handling methods.
