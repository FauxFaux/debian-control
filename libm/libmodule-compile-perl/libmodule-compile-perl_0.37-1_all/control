Description: Perl module providing a system to compile Perl modules
 Module::Compile provides a system for writing modules that *compile* other
 Perl modules.
 .
 Modules that use these compilation modules get compiled into some
 altered form the first time they are run. The result is cached into
 ".pmc" files.
 .
 Perl has native support for ".pmc" files. It always checks for them,
 before loading a ".pm" file.
