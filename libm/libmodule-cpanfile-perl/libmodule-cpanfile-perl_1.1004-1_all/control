Description: format for describing CPAN dependencies of Perl applications
 Module::CPANfile is a tool to handle cpanfile format to load application
 specific dependencies, not just for CPAN distributions.
 .
 `cpanfile` describes CPAN dependencies required to execute associated Perl
 code.
 .
 Place the `cpanfile` in the root of the directory containing the associated
 code. For instance, in a Catalyst application, place the `cpanfile` in the
 same directory as `myapp.conf`.
 .
 Tools supporting `cpanfile` format (e.g. cpanm and carton) will automatically
 detect the file and install dependencies for the code to run.
