Description: declare author-only dependencies
 Modules often have optional requirements, for example dependencies that
 are useful for (optional) tests, but not required for the module to
 work properly.
 .
 Usually you want all developers of a project to have these optional
 modules installed. However, simply telling everyone or printing
 diagnostic messages if optional dependencies are missing often isn't
 enough to make sure all authors have all optional modules installed.
 .
 Module::Install already has a way of detecting an author environment,
 so an easy way to achieve the above would be something like:
 .
  if ($Module::Install::AUTHOR) {
    requires 'Some::Module';
    requires 'Another::Module' => '0.42';
  }
 .
 Unfortunately, that'll also make the optional dependencies show up in
 the distributions "META.yml" file, which is obviously wrong, as they
 aren't actually hard requirements.
 .
 Working that around requires a considerable amount of non-trivial
 Makefile.PL hackery, or simply using Module::Install::AuthorRequires's
 "author_requires" command.
