Description: automagically generate LICENSE files
 Module::Install::AutoLicense is a Module::Install extension that
 generates a "LICENSE" file automatically whenever the author runs
 "Makefile.PL". On the user side it does nothing.
 .
 When "make distclean" is invoked by the author, the "LICENSE" is
 removed.
 .
 The appropriate license is determined from the meta provided with the
 "license" command and the holder of the license from the "author"
 command.
 .
 Software::License is used to generate the "LICENSE" file.
