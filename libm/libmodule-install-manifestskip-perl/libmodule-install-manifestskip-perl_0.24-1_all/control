Description: generate a MANIFEST.SKIP file
 Module::Install::ManifestSkip generates a "MANIFEST.SKIP" file for you
 (using Module::Manifest::Skip) that contains the common files that
 people do not want in their "MANIFEST" files. The SKIP file is
 generated each time that you (the module author) run "Makefile.PL".
 .
 You can add your own custom entries at the top of the "MANIFEST" file.
 Just put a blank line after your entries, and they will be left alone.
 .
 This module also adds 'MANIFEST' to the "clean_files()" list so that
 "make clean" will remove your "MANIFEST".
