Description: module for parsing and examining a Perl distribution MANIFEST file
 Module::Manifest is a simple utility module created originally for use in
 Module::Inspector.
 .
 It allows you to load the MANIFEST file that comes in a Perl distribution
 tarball, examine the contents, and perform some simple tasks.
 .
 Granted, the functionality needed to do this is quite simple, but the Perl
 distribution MANIFEST specification contains a couple of little
 idiosyncracies, such as line comments and space-seperated inline comments.
 .
 The use of this module means that any little nigglies are dealt with behind
 the scenes, and you can concentrate the main task at hand.
