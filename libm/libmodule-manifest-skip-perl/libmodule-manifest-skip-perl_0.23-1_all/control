Description: MANIFEST.SKIP management for Perl modules
 Module::Manifest::Skip is mostly intended for module packaging
 frameworks to share a common, up-to-date "MANIFEST.SKIP" base. For
 example, Module::Install::ManifestSkip, uses this module to get the
 actual SKIP content. However this module may be useful for any module
 author.
 .
 CPAN module authors use a MANIFEST.SKIP file to exclude certain well
 known files from getting put into a generated MANIFEST file, which
 would cause them to go into the final distribution package.
 .
 The packaging tools try to automatically skip things for you, but if
 you add one of your own entries, you have to add all the common ones
 yourself. This module attempts to make all of this boring process as
 simple and reliable as possible.
 .
 Module::Manifest::Skip can create or update a MANIFEST.SKIP file for
 you. You can add your own entries, and it will leave them alone. You
 can even tell it to not skip certain entries that it normally skips,
 although this is rarely needed.
