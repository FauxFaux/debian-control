Description: postmodern Perl module packaging
 Module::Package is a drop-in replacement for Module::Install. It does
 everything Module::Install does, but just a bit better.
 .
 Actually this module is simply a wrapper around Module::Install. It
 attempts to drastically reduce what goes in a Makefile.PL, while at the
 same time, fixing many of the problems that people have had with
 Module::Install (and other module frameworks) over the years.
