Description: module for giving  modules the ability to have plugins
 Module::Pluggable provides a simple but, hopefully, extensible way of having
 'plugins' for your module. Essentially all it does is export a method into
 your namespace that looks through a search path for .pm files and turn those
 into class names. Optionally it instantiates those classes for you.
