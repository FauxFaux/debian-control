Description: module to find and read perl modules like perl does
 Module::Reader finds modules in @INC using the same algorithm perl does. From
 that, it will give you the source content of a module, the file name (where
 available), and how it was found. Searches (and content) are based on the
 same internal rules that perl uses for require() and do().
