Description: library to detect modules loaded by Perl code without running it
 Module::Used is a Perl module that does static analysis of arbitrary Perl
 code, looking for use and require statements to determine what modules are
 required by the code. It also knows about Moose and Moose::Role, so it can
 determine appropriate dependencies in that case too.
