Description: Report versions of all modules in memory
 The author says: "I often get email from someone reporting a bug in a
 module I've written. I email back, asking what version of the module
 it is, what version of Perl on what OS, and sometimes what version of
 some relevant third library (like XML::Parser). They reply, saying
 "Perl5". I say "I need the exact version, as reported by 'perl -v'".
 They tell me. And I say "I, uh, also asked about the version of my
 module and XML::Parser [or whatever]". They say "Oh yeah. It is 2.27".
 "Is that my module or XML::Parser?" "XML::Parser." "OK, and what
 about my module's version?" "Oh yeah. That's 3.11." By this time,
 days have passed, and what should have been a simple operation --
 reporting the version of Perl and relevant modules, has been
 needlessly complicated".
 .
 This module is for simplifying that task. If you add "use
 Module::Versions::Report;" to a program (especially handy if your
 program is one that demonstrates a bug in some module), then when the
 program has finished running, you well get a report detailing all the
 modules in memory, and noting the version of each (for modules that
 defined a $VERSION, at least).
