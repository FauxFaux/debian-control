Description: Alternate C driver for the MongoDB document-oriented datastore
 MongoDB is a high-performance, open source, schema-free
 document-oriented data store.

 This library provides an alternative C language driver, focusing on
 stability, ease of use, striving to make the most common use cases as
 convenient as possible.
 .
 Among its features are:
 .
   * Well documented, easy, clean and stable API.
   * Support for asynchronous operation.
   * ReplicaSet support, with support for automatic reconnecting and
   discovery.
   * Safe-mode support, to optionally enable extra safety checks on
   writes.
