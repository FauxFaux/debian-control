Description: family of perl modules to streamline writing Monitoring plugins
 Monitoring::Plugin and its associated Monitoring::Plugin::* modules are a
 family of perl modules to streamline writing Monitoring plugins. The main end
 user modules are Monitoring::Plugin, providing an object-oriented interface
 to the entire Monitoring::Plugin::* collection, and
 Monitoring::Plugin::Functions, providing a simpler functional interface to a
 useful subset of the available functionality.
 .
 The purpose of the collection is to make it as simple as possible for
 developers to create plugins that conform the Monitoring Plugin guidelines
 (https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html).
