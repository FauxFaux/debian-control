Description: module to monkey-patching subs from other packages, with restore
 Monkey patching is a way to extend or modify the runtime code of a program or
 library without altering the original source code.
 .
 Monkey::Patch::Action is based on Monkey::Patch and provides lexical scope
 monkey-patching so that you can wrap any other package's subroutine with your
 own code. It makes things even easier by helping you apply a stack of patches
 and unapply them later in flexible order.
