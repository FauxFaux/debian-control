Description: Minimalist Object Orientation library (with Moose compatibility)
 Moo is an extremely light-weight, high-performance Moose replacement. It also
 avoids depending on any XS modules to allow simple deployments. The name Moo
 is based on the idea that it provides almost - but not quite - two thirds of
 Moose.
 .
 Unlike Mouse this module does not aim at full Moose compatibility. See
 INCOMPATIBILITIES in Moo(3pm) for more details.
