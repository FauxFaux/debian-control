Description: blessed arrayrefs with Moose
 Objects implemented with arrayrefs rather than hashrefs are often
 faster than those implemented with hashrefs. Moose's default object
 implementation is hashref based. Can we go faster?
 .
 Simply "use MooseX::ArrayRef" instead of "use Moose", but note the
 limitations (see documentation).
 .
 The current implementation is mostly a proof of concept, but it does
 mostly seem to work.
