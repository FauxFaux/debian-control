Description: Perl library to extend your attribute interfaces
 MooseX::AttributeHelpers provides commonly-used attribute helper methods for
 more specific types of data than those offered by Moose alone. It provides
 Bool, Counter, Number, String, Array, Bag, Hash, ImmutableHash, and List
 attribute types.
 .
 These modules are deprecated, as their functionality is available in Moose
 itself as native attribute traits.
