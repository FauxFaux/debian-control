Description: module to emulate Class::Accessor::Fast using Moose attributes
 MooseX::Emulate::Class::Accessor::Fast attempts to emulate the behavior of
 Class::Accessor::Fast as accurately as possible using the Moose attribute
 system.
 .
 The public API of Class::Accessor::Fast is wholly supported, but the private
 methods are not. If you are only using the public methods (as you should) then
 migrating to this is trivial.
