Description: moose extension to ark overload code symbols as methods
 MooseX::MarkAsMethods is a Perl module that allows one to easily mark
 certain functions as Moose methods. This will allow other packages
 such as namespace::autoclean to operate without blowing away your
 overloads. After using MooseX::MarkAsMethods your overloads will be
 recognized by Class::MOP as being methods, and class extension as well
 as composition from roles with overloads will "just work".
 .
 By default this module checks for overloads, and marks those functions
 as methods.
 .
 namespace::autoclean will be invoked to clear out non-methods when
 'autoclean => 1' is passed to import or use.
