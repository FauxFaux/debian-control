Description: munge your "has" (works with Moo, Moose and Mouse)
 MooseX::MungeHas alters the behaviour of the attributes of your Moo,
 Moose or Mouse based class. It manages to support all three because it
 doesn't attempt to do anything smart with metathingies; it simply
 installs a wrapper for 'has' that munges the attribute specification
 hash before passing it on to the original 'has' function.
