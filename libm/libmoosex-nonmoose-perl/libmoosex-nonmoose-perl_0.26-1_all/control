Description: Moose extension to allow easy subclassing of non-Moose classes
 MooseX::NonMoose allows for easily subclassing non-Moose classes with Moose,
 taking care of the annoying details connected with doing this. It tries to be
 as non-intrusive as possible - in most cases, inheriting from Moose classes
 and inheriting from non-Moose classes should work identically.
