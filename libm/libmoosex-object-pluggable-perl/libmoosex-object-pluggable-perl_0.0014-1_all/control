Description: Perl module for adding plugin support to your Moose classes
 MooseX::Object::Pluggable is meant to be loaded as a role from Moose-based
 classes. It will add five methods and four attributes to assist you with the
 loading and handling of plugins and extensions for plugins. This may pollute
 your namespace, however great care has been taken in using the least
 ambiguous names possible.
