Description: simple Moose role providing a standard param method
 The MooseX::Param Perl module is a very simple Moose role which provides a
 CGI like param method. It provides a params attribute which has a read-only
 accessor and a HashRef type constraint. It also adds a builder method to
 properly initialize it.
