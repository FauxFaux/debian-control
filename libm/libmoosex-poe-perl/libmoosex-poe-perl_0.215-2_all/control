Description: Moose wrapper around a POE::Session
 MooseX::POE is a Perl module that provides a Moose-ish way to manipulate
 POE::Session instances. It provides an 'event' keyword to associate events
 with a given block of code. The current session will then be able to run
 these events in the normal fashion, whilst providing the encapsulation and
 other nice features afforded by Moose.
