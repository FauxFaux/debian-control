Description: module for applying Moose roles to a related class
 Frequently, you have to use a class that provides some foo_class accessor or
 attribute as a method of dependency injection. Use MooseX::RelatedClassRoles
 when you'd rather apply roles to make your custom foo_class instead of
 manually setting up a subclass.
