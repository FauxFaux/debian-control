Description: module for using strict 'roles' with Moose
 When using Moose::Role, a class which provides a method a role provides will
 silently override that method. This can cause strange, hard-to-debug errors
 when the role's methods are not called. Simple use MooseX::Role::Strict
 instead of Moose::Role and overriding a role's method becomes a
 composition-time failure.
