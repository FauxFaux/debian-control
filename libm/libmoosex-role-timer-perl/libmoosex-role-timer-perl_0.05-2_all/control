Description: Moose role for measuring elapsed time with Time::HiRes
 MooseX::Role::Timer is a Moose role that provides timers to your
 object, making it easier to keep track of how long whatever actions
 take. Time is measured with Time::Hires so sub-second timers are possible.
 .
 This Perl module is compatible with Any::Moose.
