Description: Moose extension for roles that support overloading
 MooseX::Role::WithOverloading allows you to write a Moose::Role which defines
 overloaded operators and allows those operator overloadings to be composed
 into the classes/roles/instances it's compiled to, while plain Moose::Roles
 would lose the overloading.
