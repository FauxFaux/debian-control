Description: tag a class as a runnable application
 MooseX::Runnable is a framework for making classes runnable
 applications.  This role doesn't do anything other than tell the rest
 of the framework that your class is a runnable application that has a
 run method which accepts arguments and returns the process' exit code.
 .
 This is a convention that the community has been using for a while.
 This role tells the computer that your class uses this convention, and
 let's the computer abstract away some of the tedium this entails.
