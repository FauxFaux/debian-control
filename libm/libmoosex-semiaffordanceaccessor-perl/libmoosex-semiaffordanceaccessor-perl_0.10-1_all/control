Description: Perl module to generate accessors automatically
 MooseX::SemiAffordanceAccessor is a module that changes the default naming
 policy for the loading class so that methods are separated into accessors
 (which have the same name as the attribute) and mutators (via set_ methods).
 .
 It is compatible with existing naming schemes, since attributes that explicitly
 provide a "reader" or "writer" name are left unchanged. The terminology
 "semi-affordance" is inspired by David Wheeler's Class::Meta module (see
 libclass-meta-perl).
