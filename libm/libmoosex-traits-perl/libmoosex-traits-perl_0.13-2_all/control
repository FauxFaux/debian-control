Description: Moose extension to apply roles at object creation time
 MooseX::Traits provides a method to add some roles to a class when creating
 it (during new). Since components can be added easily to a given class, users
 don't have to create a named class with the desired roles applied or apply
 the roles to the instance one-by-one. This module also provides a basic way
 to initialize the applied roles' attributes while constructing objects.
