Description: Moose type providing the loose behavior of Moose's old Num type
 MooseX::Types::LaxNum accepts everything for which Scalar::Util's
 looks_like_number() returns true. It can be used to get the old behaviour of
 Moose::Util::TypeConstraints::Num, since Num has been changed to be more
 strict since 2.10.
