Description: Moose extension for NetAddr::IP type constraints
 MooseX::Types::NetAddr::IP provides IP Address type constraints and coercions
 for Moose, based on NetAddr::IP (see libnet-addr-ip-perl). It provides three
 subtypes: NetAddrIPv4 and NetAddrIPv6 (which must be IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
 respectively) as well as NetAddrIP (which may be an IPv4 or IPv6 address).
