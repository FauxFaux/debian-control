Description: Path::Class type library for Moose
 MooseX::Types::Path::Class creates common Moose types, coercions and option
 specifications useful for dealing with Path::Class objects as Moose
 attributes.
 .
 Coercions (see Moose::Util::TypeConstraints) are made from both 'Str' and
 'ArrayRef' to both Path::Class::Dir and Path::Class::File objects. If you
 have MooseX::Getopt installed, the Getopt option type ("=s") will be added
 for both Path::Class::Dir and Path::Class::File.
