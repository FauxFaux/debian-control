Description: Perl module providing a Set::Object type
 MooseX::Types::Set::Object provides Moose type constraint (see MooseX::Types
 and Moose::Util::TypeConstraints) that is a Set::Object, with coercions. It
 is essentially a collection of unordered objects without duplication (see
 Set Theory in Mathematics).
 .
 Similarly, it allows one to operate on these sets - determining their union,
 intersection, difference and symmetric difference in a trivial way. There are
 many more operations, which are discussed in Set::Object's documentation.
