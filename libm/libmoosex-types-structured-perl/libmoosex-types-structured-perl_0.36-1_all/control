Description: Moose extension for type constraints on structured types
 MooseX::Types::Structured provides structured type constraints for Moose. A
 structured type constraint is a standard container Moose type constraint,
 such as an ArrayRef or HashRef, which has been enhanced to allow you to
 explicitly name all the allowed type constraints inside the structure.
