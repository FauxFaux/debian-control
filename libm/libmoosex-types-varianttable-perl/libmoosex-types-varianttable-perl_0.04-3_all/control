Description: Moose extension for a type-constraint based dispatch table
 MooseX::Types::VariantTable is a Moose extension that implements a simple
 dispatch table based on Moose type constraints. Subtypes will be checked
 before their parents, meaning that the order of the declaration does not
 matter.
