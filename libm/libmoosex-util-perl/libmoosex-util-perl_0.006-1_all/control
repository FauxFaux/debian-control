Description: Moose::Util extensions
 MooseX::Util is a utility module that handles all of the same functions that
 Moose::Util handles. In fact, most of the functions exported by this package
 are simply re-exports from Moose::Util. However, a number of the functions
 have been re-implemented, for a variety of reasons.
