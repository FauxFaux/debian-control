Description: easy Moo style way to make command organized CLI apps
 MooX::Cmd eases the writing of command line utilities, accepting
 commands and subcommands and so on. These commands can form a tree,
 which is mirrored in the package structure. On invocation each command
 along the path through the tree (starting from the toplevel command
 through to the most specific one) is instanciated.
