Description: easily translate Moose code to Moo
 Moo is a light-weight object oriented programming framework which
 aims to be partly compatible with Moose. However, the surface syntax
 of Moo differs somewhat from Moose.
 .
 MooX::late provides some assistance by enabling a slightly more
 Moosey surface syntax. MooX::late makes it easier:
 .
  - to port code that was initially written for Moose to Moo
  - to write Moo code that can later be converted to use the
    full Moose feature-set if needed.
