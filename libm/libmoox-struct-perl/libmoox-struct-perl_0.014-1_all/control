Description: simple lightweight record-like structures making sounds like cows
 MooX::Struct allows you to create cheap struct-like classes for your
 data using Moo.
 .
 While similar in spirit to MooseX::Struct and Class::Struct,
 MooX::Struct has a somewhat different usage pattern. Rather than
 providing you with a "struct" keyword which can be used to define
 structs, you define all the structs as part of the "use" statement.
 This means they happen at compile time.
 .
 A struct is just an "anonymous" Moo class. MooX::Struct creates this
 class for you, and installs a lexical alias for it in your namespace.
 Thus your module can create a "Point3D" struct, and some other module
 can too, and they won't interfere with each other. All struct classes
 inherit from MooX::Struct.
