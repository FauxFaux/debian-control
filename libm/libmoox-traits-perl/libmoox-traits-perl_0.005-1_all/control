Description: module to automatically apply roles at object creation time
 Like MooseX::Traits, the MooX::Traits module provides a method to add some
 roles to a class when creating it (during new), only for Moo.
 .
 Although called MooX::Traits, this module actually uses Role::Tiny, so
 doesn't really require Moo. If you use it in a non-Moo class, you should be
 able to safely consume any Role::Tiny-based traits.
 .
 If you use it in a Moo class, you should also be able to consume
 Moo::Role-based traits and Moose::Role-based traits.
