Description: module providing some Moosish types and a type builder
 Moo attributes (like Moose) have an 'isa' property.
 MooX::Types::MooseLike(::Base) provides some basic types for this property.
 One can import all types with the ':all' tag or import a list of types.
 .
 These types provide a check that the contact attribute is a hash reference,
 that the guest_list is an array reference, and that the records are an array
 of hash references.
