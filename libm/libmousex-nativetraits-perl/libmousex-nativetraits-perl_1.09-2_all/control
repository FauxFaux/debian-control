Description: extension for attribute interfaces for Mouse
 While Mouse attributes provide a way to name your accessors, readers,
 writers, clearers and predicates, MouseX::NativeTraits provides
 commonly used attribute helper methods for more specific types of data.
 .
 As seen in the "SYNOPSIS", you specify the data structure via the
 "traits" parameter. These traits will be loaded automatically, so you
 need not load MouseX::NativeTraits explicitly.
 .
 This extension is compatible with Moose native traits, although it is
 not a part of Mouse core.
