Description: Path::Class type library for Mouse
 MouseX::Types::Path::Class creates common Mouse types, coercions and
 option specifications useful for dealing with Path::Class objects as
 Mouse attributes.
 .
 Coercions (see Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints) are made from both "Str"
 and "ArrayRef" to both Path::Class::Dir and Path::Class::File objects.
 If you have MouseX::Getopt installed, the Getopt option type ("=s") will
 be added for both Path::Class::Dir and Path::Class::File.
