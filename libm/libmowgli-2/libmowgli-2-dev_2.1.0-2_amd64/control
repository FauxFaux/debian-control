Description: high performance development framework for C (development)
 Mowgli is a development framework for C (like GLib), which provides high
 performance and highly flexible algorithms. It can be used as a supplement
 to GLib (to add additional functions (dictionaries, hashes), or replace some
 of the slow GLib list manipulation functions), or stand alone. It also
 provides a powerful hook system and convenient logging for your code, as well
 as high performance block allocator.
 .
 This package contains files needed for development with this library and code
 examples.
