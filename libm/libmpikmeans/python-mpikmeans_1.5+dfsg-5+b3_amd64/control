Description: Python bindings for MPIKmeans
 This library uses an algorithm that yields the very same solution as standard
 k-means, even after each iteration. However, it uses triangle inequalities, and
 is much faster.
 .
 Note: MPI here does not refer to the Message Passing Interface; rather, it is
 an acronym for Max Planck Institute, where this algorithm was developed.
 .
 This package contains the Python bindings. Both the old, ctypes-based and the
 new, Cython-based interfaces are provided.
