Description: set of programs to perform proteomics data analyses (doc)
 Implementations of two compression schemes for numeric data from mass
 spectrometers.
 .
 The library provides implementations of 3 different algorithms, 1 designed to
 compress first order smooth data like retention time or M/Z arrays, and 2 for
 compressing non smooth data with lower requirements on precision like ion count
 arrays.
 .
 This package ships the documentation to the ms-numpress software.
