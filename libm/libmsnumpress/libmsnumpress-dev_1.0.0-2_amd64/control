Description: Numeric data compression for mass spectrometry (devel files)
 Implementations of two compression schemes for numeric data from mass
 spectrometers.
 .
 The library provides implementations of 3 different algorithms, 1 designed to
 compress first order smooth data like retention time or M/Z arrays, and 2 for
 compressing non smooth data with lower requirements on precision like ion count
 arrays.
 .
 This package ships the library development files.
