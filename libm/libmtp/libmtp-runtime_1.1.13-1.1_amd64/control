Description: Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) runtime tools
 libmtp is a library for communicating with MTP aware devices in POSIX
 compliant operating systems.  It implements MTP Basic, the subset
 proposed for standardization.
 .
 The Media Transfer Protocol (commonly referred to as MTP) is a devised
 set of custom extensions to support the transfer of music files on
 USB digital audio players and movie files on USB portable media players.
 .
 This package provides mtp-probe, a program to probe newly connected
 device interfaces from userspace to determine if they are MTP devices,
 used for udev rules.
