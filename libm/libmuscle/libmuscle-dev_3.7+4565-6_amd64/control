Description: multiple alignment development library for protein sequences
 MUSCLE is a multiple alignment program for protein sequences. MUSCLE
 stands for multiple sequence comparison by log-expectation. In the
 authors tests, MUSCLE achieved the highest scores of all tested
 programs on several alignment accuracy benchmarks, and is also one of
 the fastest programs out there.
 .
 This library was derived from the original MUSCLE and turned into
 a library.
