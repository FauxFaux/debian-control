Description: brush library for mypaint
 MyPaint is a pressure- and tilt-sensitive painting program which works well
 with Wacom graphics tablets and other similar devices. It comes with a large
 brush collection including charcoal and ink to emulate real media, but the
 highly configurable brush engine allows you to experiment with your own
 brushes and with not-quite-natural painting.
