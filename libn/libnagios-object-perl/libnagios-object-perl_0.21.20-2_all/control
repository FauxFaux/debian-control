Description: module to parse and represent Nagios configuration as objects
 Nagios::Object is a group of modules for parsing a Nagios configuration and
 providing an object representation in Perl. It has support for inheriting from
 templates and the structure is kept in tact within the Perl representation.
 .
 Nagios::StatusLog reads the Nagios status log and returns Status objects which
 can be used to get status information about a host.
 .
 Nagios::Config creates a new Nagios::Config object, which will parse a Nagios
 main configuration file and all of it's object configuration files.
