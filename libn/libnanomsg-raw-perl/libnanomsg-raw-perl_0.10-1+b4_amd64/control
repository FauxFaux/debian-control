Description: low-level interface to nanomsg for Perl
 NanoMsg::Raw is a binding directly to the underlying nanomsg C library.
 It is intended to provide a very low-level and manual interface; it does
 not provide a convenient high-level API, integration with event loops,
 or any other abstractions.
