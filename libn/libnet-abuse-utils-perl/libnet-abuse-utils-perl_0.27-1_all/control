Description: Routines useful for processing network abuse
 Net::Abuse::Utils provides several functions useful for determining
 information about an IP address including contact/reporting addresses,
 ASN/network info, reverse DNS, and DNSBL listing status. Functions which take
 an IP accept either IPv6 or IPv4 IPs unless indicated otherwise.
 .
 It also contains a small command-line tool called ip-info which on
 the one hand show-cases the capabilities of this Perl module, but is
 also useful in general for gathering information about some IP
 address.
