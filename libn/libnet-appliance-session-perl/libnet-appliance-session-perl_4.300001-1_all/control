Description: module for running command-line sessions to network appliances
 Use Net::Appliance::Session to establish an interactive command-line
 session with a network appliance. There is special support for moving
 into "privileged" mode and "configure" mode, along with the ability to
 send commands to the connected device and retrieve returned output.
 .
 Built-in commands come from a phrasebook which supports many network device
 vendors (Cisco, HP, etc) or you can install a new phrasebook. Most phases of
 the connection are configurable for different device behaviours.
