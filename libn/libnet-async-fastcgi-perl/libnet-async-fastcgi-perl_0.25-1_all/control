Description: FastCGI engine using IO::Async
 Net::Async::FastCGI allows a program to respond asynchronously to FastCGI
 requests, as part of a program based on IO::Async. An object in this class
 represents a single FastCGI responder that the webserver is configured to
 communicate with. It can handle multiple outstanding requests at a time,
 responding to each as data is provided by the program. Individual outstanding
 requests that have been started but not yet finished, are represented by
 instances of Net::Async::FastCGI::Request.
