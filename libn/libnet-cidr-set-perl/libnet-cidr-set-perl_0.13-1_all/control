Description: Net::CIDR::Set perl module to manipulate sets of IP addresses
 Net::CIDR::Set represents sets of IP addresses and allows standard
 set operations (union, intersection, membership test etc.) to be
 performed on them.
 .
 In spite of the name it can work with sets consisting of arbitrary
 ranges of IP addresses - not just CIDR blocks.  It works on IPv4 and
 IPv6 addresses.
