Description: Citadel.org protocol coverage
 Citadel is a "turnkey open-source solution for email and collaboration".
 The main component is the Citadel server. To communicate with it you can
 use either a web interface, or - if you have to automate things - with a
 protocol. NET::Citadel tries to do a bit of abstraction and handles some
 of the protocol handling. The basic idea is that the application using
 the package deals with Citadel's objects: rooms, floors, users.
