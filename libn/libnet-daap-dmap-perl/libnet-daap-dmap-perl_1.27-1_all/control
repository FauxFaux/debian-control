Description: Perl module for reading and writing DAAP structures
 Net::DAAP::DMAP allows reading and writing DAAP structures. A DMAP structure
 is a binary record used in Apple's DAAP protocol. It may contain other DMAP
 structures. Fields in a DMAP structure are identified by a short name
 ("msdc"). The short name is what's in the binary record, but a content codes
 list gives a long name ("dmap.databasescount") and a data type for the record
 (32-bit integer).
