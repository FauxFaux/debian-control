Description: Perl interface for handling DHCP packets
 Net::DHCP is a release of the DHCP protocol interface to Perl 5. There are
 two parts to the interface: the packet component (Net::DHCP::Packet) and the
 constants component (Net::DHCP::Constants) which represents constants used
 in DHCP protocol, defined in RFC 1533, RFC 2132, RFC 2241, RFC 2485,
 RFC 2563, RFC 2937, RFC 3004, RFC 3011, RFC 3046.
 .
 With Net::DHCP you can create and analyze DHCP packets which are sent or
 received with the help of IO::Socket::INET.
