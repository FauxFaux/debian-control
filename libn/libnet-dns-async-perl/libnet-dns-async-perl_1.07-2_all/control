Description: Asynchronous DNS helper for high volume perl applications
 Net::DNS::Async is a fire-and-forget asynchronous DNS helper.
 That is, the user application adds DNS questions to the helper, and
 the callback will be called at some point in the future without
 further intervention from the user application. The application need
 not handle selects, timeouts, waiting for a response or any other
 such issues.
 .
 If the same query is added to the queue more than once, the module
 may combine the queries; that is, it will perform the query only
 once, and will call each callback registered for that query in turn,
 passing the same Net::DNS::Response object to each query. For this
 reason, you should not modify the Net::DNS::Response object in any
 way lest you break things horribly for a subsequent callback.
 .
 This module is similar in principle to POE::Component::Client::DNS, but
 does not require POE.
