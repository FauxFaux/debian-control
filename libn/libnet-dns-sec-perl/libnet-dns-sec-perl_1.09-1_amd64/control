Description: DNSSEC extension to NET::DNS
 Net::DNS::SEC implements DNS Resource Record types that are relevant
 for DNSSEC operations. This package implements RFC4034
 "Resource Records for the DNS Security Extensions" and RFC2931 "DNS
 Request and Transaction Signatures ( SIG(0)s )"
 .
 It also provides support for SIG0. That later is useful for dynamic
 updates using key-pairs.
 .
 RSA and DSA crypto routines are supported.
