Description: module implementing the Extensible Provisioning Protocol
 Net::EPP is a collection of Perl modules that collectively implement the
 Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) as defined in RFC 4930. EPP is used
 for provisioning and management of objects stored in a shared repository.
 The protocol defines generic object management operations and an extensible
 framework that maps operations to objects.
 .
 Many Network Information Centres use EPP to provide services for provisioning
 of Internet domain names, hosts, and related contact details.
