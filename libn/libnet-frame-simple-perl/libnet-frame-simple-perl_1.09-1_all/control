Description: module to make crafting network frames easier
 Net::Frame::Simple is part of Net::Frame frame crafting framework. It is
 totally optional, but can make playing with the network far easier.
 .
 Basically, it hides the complexity of frame forging, sending, and receiving,
 by providing helper methods, which will analyze internally how to assemble
 frames and find responses to probes.
 .
 For example, it will take care of computing lengths and checksums, and
 matching a response frame to the requesting frame.
