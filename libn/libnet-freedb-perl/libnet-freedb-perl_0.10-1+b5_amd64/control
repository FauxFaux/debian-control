Description: Perl interface to freedb servers
 Net::FreeDB was inspired by Net::CDDB.  And in-fact was designed as a
 replacement in-part by Net::CDDB's author Jeremy D. Zawodny.  Net::FreeDB
 provides an OOP interface to the FreeDB servers as well as some basic
 CDROM functionality like determining disc ids, track offsets, etc.
