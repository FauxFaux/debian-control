Description: Hotline interface module for Perl
 Net::Hotline contains an interface to write programs that connect to
 Hotline servers.  Hotline is a set of protocols allowing chat, news, and file

 tracker, which is a meta-server that users can access to obtain a list of
 registered servers and connect to them.
