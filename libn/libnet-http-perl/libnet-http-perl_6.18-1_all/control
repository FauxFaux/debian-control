Description: module providing low-level HTTP connection client
 The Net::HTTP class is a low-level HTTP client.  An instance of the
 Net::HTTP class represents a connection to an HTTP server.  The
 HTTP protocol is described in RFC 2616.  The Net::HTTP class
 supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1. Net::HTTP is a sub-class of IO::Socket::INET.
 You can mix its methods with reading and writing from the socket directly.
 This is not necessarily a good idea, unless you know what you are doing.
