Description: low-level non-blocking HTTPS client
 Net::HTTPS::NB provides a non-blocking HTTPS client. It has the same
 interface as Net::HTTPS and Net::HTTP, but it will never try multiple
 reads when the read_response_headers() or read_entity_body() methods are
 invoked. If read_response_headers() did not see enough data to complete
 the headers an empty list is returned. If read_entity_body() did not see
 new entity data in its read the value -1 is returned.
