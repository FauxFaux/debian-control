Description: Perl module to lookup the username on the remote end of a TCP/IP connection
 Net::Ident is a Perl module implementing the RFC1413 Identification Protocol,
 also known as "ident".
 .
 It provides both a simple interface for doing one ident lookup at a time, and
 an asynchronous interface to perform (possibly) many simultaneous lookups, or
 simply continue serving other things while the lookup is proceeding.
