Description: Perl module for manipulating host network interfaces
 Net::Interface is a module that allows access to the host network interfaces
 in a manner similar to ifconfig(8). Version 1.00 is a complete re-write and
 includes support for IPV6 as well as the traditional IPV4.
 .
 Both read and write access to network device attributes including the
 creation of new logical and physical interfaces is available where supported
 by the OS and this module.
 .
 NOTE: Many of the operations of Net::Interface, particularly those that set
 interface values require privileged access to OS resources. Wherever possible,
 Net::Interface will simply fail softly when there are not adequateprivileges
 to perform the requested operation or where the operation is not supported.
