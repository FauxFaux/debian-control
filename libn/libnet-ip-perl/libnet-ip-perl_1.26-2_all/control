Description: Perl extension for manipulating IPv4/IPv6 addresses
 Net::IP provides functions to deal with IPv4/IPv6 addresses.
 The module can be used as a class, allowing the user to instantiate IP
 objects, which can be single IP addresses, prefixes, or ranges of addresses.
 There is also a procedural way of accessing most of the functions. Most
 subroutines can take either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses transparently.
