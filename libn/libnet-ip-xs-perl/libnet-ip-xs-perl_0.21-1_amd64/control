Description: Perl extension for manipulating IPv4/IPv6 addresses (XS)
 Net::IP::XS is a XS (C) implementation of Net::IP (libnet-ip-perl in
 Debian) that provides functions to deal with IPv4/IPv6 addresses.
 .
 The module can be used as a class, allowing the user to instantiate
 IP objects, which can be single IP addresses, prefixes, or ranges of
 addresses.  There is also a procedural way of accessing most of the
 functions. Most subroutines can take either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
 transparently.
