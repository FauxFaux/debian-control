Description: automated Bot creation with safeties
 This Perl module, Net::Jabber::Bot, provides tools for writing a Jabber
 Bot.
 .
 The idea behind the module is that someone creating a bot should not
 really have to know a whole lot about how the Jabber protocol works in
 order to use it. It also allows us to abstract away all the things
 that can get a bot maker into trouble. Essentially the object helps
 protect the coders from their own mistakes.
