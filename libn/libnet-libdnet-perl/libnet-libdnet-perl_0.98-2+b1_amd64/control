Description: interface to libdumbnet's low-level network functions
 Net::Libdnet is a Perl module that provides a simple and portable interface
 to many useful low-level networking routines. Its functionality includes
 network address manipulation, kernel ARP cache and route table manipulation,
 firewalling, network interface manipulation, network traffic interception via
 tunnel interfaces, and raw IP packet/Ethernet frame transmission.
 .
 This module is intended to complement functionality provided by libpcap. For
 historical reasons, Dug Song's libdnet is called libdumbnet on Debian.
