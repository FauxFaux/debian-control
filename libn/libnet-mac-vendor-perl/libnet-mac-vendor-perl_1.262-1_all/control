Description: module to look up the vendor by OUI
 The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) assigns an
 Organizational Unique Identifier (OUI) to manufacturers of network
 interfaces. Each interface has a Media Access Control (MAC) address of six
 bytes. The first three bytes are the OUI.
 .
 Net::MAC::Vendor allows you to take a MAC address and turn it into the OUI
 and vendor information. You can, for instance, scan a network, collect MAC
 addresses, and turn those addresses into vendors. With vendor information,
 you can often guess at what you are looking at (e.g. an Apple product).
 .
 You can use this as a module as its individual functions, or call it as a
 script with a list of MAC addresses as arguments. The module can figure it
 out.
