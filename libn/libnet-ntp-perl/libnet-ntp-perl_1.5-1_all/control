Description: Perl module to query NTP servers
 Net::NTP is a small perl module to query an NTP (Network Time Protocol)
 time server for the current time. It exports a single method
 (get_ntp_response) and returns an associative array based upon RFC1305 and
 RFC2030.  The response from the server is "humanized" to a point that further
 processing of the information received from the server can be manipulated.
 For example: timestamps are in epoch, so one could use the localtime function
 to produce an even more "human" representation of the timestamp.
