Description: Perl interface for domain registration via the Tucows OpenSRS HTTPS XML API.
 The client library distributed by OpenSRS can be difficult to integrate into
 a custom environment, and their web interface becomes quickly tedious with
 heavy usage. This is a clean and relatively quick library to perform the
 most common API methods described in the OpenSRS API documentation.
