Description: Perl SSH client package implemented on top of OpenSSH
 Net::OpenSSH is a secure shell client package implemented on top of the
 OpenSSH binary client (ssh), leveraging the multiplexing feature found
 in current versions of OpenSSH. That is, when a new Net::OpenSSH object
 is created, ssh is run in master mode establishing a permanent
 connection. Then, every time a new operation is requested, a new ssh
 process is started in slave mode, reusing the master SSH
 connection to send the request to the remote side. This makes
 Net::OpenSSH very fast, as most of the latency of ssh is intrinsic to
 the protocol.
 .
 If you like the API of other Perl SSH distributions like Net::SSH,
 Net::SSH2 or Net::SSH::Perl, and would like to use them with
 Net::OpenSSH, have a look at the libnet-openssh-compat-perl package.
