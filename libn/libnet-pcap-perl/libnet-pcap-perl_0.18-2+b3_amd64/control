Description: Perl binding to the LBL pcap packet capture library
 Net::Pcap allows the user to interface with the LBL pcap(3) library.
 Libpcap describes itself as "a system-independent interface for user-level
 packet capture. Libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network
 monitoring." This modules gives a program the ability to capture data from a
 network interface in a similar way tcpdump does.
