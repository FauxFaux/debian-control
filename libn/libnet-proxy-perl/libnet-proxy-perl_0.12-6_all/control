Description: Framework for proxying network connections in many ways
 This module is a framework for creating various kinds of network
 proxies in a very simple way.
 .
 A proxy is a program that transfer data across a network boundary between
 a client and a server. Net::Proxy introduces the concept of "connectors",
 which abstract the server part (connected to the client) and the client
 part (connected to the server) of the proxy.
 .
 This makes it very easy to implement specific techniques to cross a
 given network boundary, possibly by using a proxy on one side of the
 network fence, and a reverse-proxy on the other side of the fence.
 .
 This package also provides the sslh SSH/HTTPS service multiplexer
 written in perl.
