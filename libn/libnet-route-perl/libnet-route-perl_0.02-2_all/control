Description: portable interface to the routing table
 Every OS provides its custom interface to the routing table: Linux's
 "route" utility is different from BSD's "route show", from Windows'
 "route print", etc. Parsing all these different output styles in an
 (otherwise portable) script can quickly become inconvenient.
 .
 Net::Route abstracts the system specifics and provides a single,
 portable interface.
