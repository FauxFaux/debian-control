Description: versatile and extensible mail server framework
 Net::Server::Mail is a versatile and extensible implementation of the SMTP
 protocol and closely-related protocols like ESMTP and LMTP. The event driven
 object-oriented API makes it easy to incorporate the SMTP protocol into perl

 to be easily inherited from.
