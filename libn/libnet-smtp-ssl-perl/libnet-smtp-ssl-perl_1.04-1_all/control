Description: Perl module providing SSL support to Net::SMTP
 Net::SMTP::SSL implements the same API as Net::SMTP, but uses IO::Socket::SSL
 for its network operations. Due to the nature of Net::SMTP's new method, it is
 not overridden to make use of a default port for the SMTPS service. Perhaps
 future versions will be smart like that. Port 465 is usually what you want,
 and it's not a pain to specify that.
 .
 This package is deprecated. Net::SMTP (in perl core) has support for SMTP
 over SSL, and also for STARTTLS, since version 1.28 (included in Perl 5.22).
