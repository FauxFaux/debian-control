Description: Perl module to script telnetable connections
 Net::Telnet allows you to make client connections to a TCP port and
 do network I/O, especially to a port using the TELNET protocol.
 Simple I/O methods such as print, get, and getline are provided.
 More sophisticated interactive features are provided because
 connecting to a TELNET port ultimately means communicating with a
 program designed for human interaction.  These interactive features
 include the ability to specify a timeout and to wait for patterns to
 appear in the input stream, such as the prompt from a shell.
