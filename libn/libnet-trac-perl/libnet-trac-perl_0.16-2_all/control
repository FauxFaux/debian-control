Description: Perl client library for Trac
 Net::Trac is simple client library for a remote Trac instance. Because
 Trac doesn't provide a web services API, this module currently "fakes"
 an RPC interface around Trac's webforms and the feeds it exports.
 Because of this, it's somewhat more brittle than a true RPC client would
 be.
 .
 As of now, this module has been tested against Trac 10.4 and Trac 11.0.
 .
 The author's needs for this module are somewhat modest and its current
 featureset reflects this. Right now, only basic read/write functionality
 for Trac's tickets is provided.
