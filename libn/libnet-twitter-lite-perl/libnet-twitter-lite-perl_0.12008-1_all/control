Description: interface to the Twitter API
 Net::Twitter::Lite is a lightweight Perl implementation of the Twitter API.
 It uses the same definitions as Net::Twitter (see libnet-twitter-perl), but
 without the extra bells and whistles. Same great taste, less filling.
 .
 This module is related to, but is not part of, Net::Twitter. Its API methods
 and documentation are derived from Net::Twitter's internals. It exists for
 those who cannot, or prefer not to install Moose and its dependencies.
 .
 If you need additional functionality, finer-grained control over features,
 backwards compatibility with older versions and additional error handling
 options, you should using Net::Twitter instead.
