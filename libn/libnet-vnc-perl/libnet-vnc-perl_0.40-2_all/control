Description: Perl module implementing a simple VNC client
 Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a desktop sharing system which uses the
 RFB (Remote FrameBuffer) protocol to remotely control another computer.
 Net::VNC acts as a VNC client and communicates to a VNC server using the RFB
 protocol, allowing you to capture the screen of the remote computer.
 .
 This module dies upon connection errors (with a timeout of 15 seconds) and
 protocol errors.
 .
 This implementation is based largely on the RFB Protocol Specification,
 http://www.realvnc.com/docs/rfbproto.pdf. That document has an error in the
 DES encryption description, which is clarified via
 http://www.vidarholen.net/contents/junk/vnc.html.
