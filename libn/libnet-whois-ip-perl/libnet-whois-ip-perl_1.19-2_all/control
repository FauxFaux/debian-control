Description: Lookup whois entries of IP addresses with Perl
 Net::Whois::IP is a module to do whois lookup of IP addresses. It
 should recursively query the various whois providers until it gets
 the more detailed information including either TechPhone or
 OrgTechPhone by default; however, this is overrideable.
