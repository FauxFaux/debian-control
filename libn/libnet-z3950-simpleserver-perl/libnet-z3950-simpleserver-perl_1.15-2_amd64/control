Description: simple perl API for building Z39.50 servers
 The Net::Z3950::SimpleServer module is a tool for constructing Z39.50
 "Information Retrieval" servers in Perl. The module is easy to use, but it does
 help to have an understanding of the Z39.50 query structure and the
 construction of structured retrieval records.
 .
 Z39.50 is a network protocol for searching remote databases and
 retrieving the results in the form of structured "records". It is widely
 used in libraries around the world, as well as in the US Federal Government.
 In addition, it is generally useful whenever you wish to integrate a number
 of different database systems around a shared, asbtract data model.
 .
 The model of the module is simple: It implements a "generic" Z39.50
 server, which invokes callback functions supplied by you to search
 for content in your database. You can use any tools available in
 Perl to supply the content, including modules like DBI and
 WWW::Search.
 .
 The server will take care of managing the network connections for
 you, and it will spawn a new process (or thread, in some
 environments) whenever a new connection is received.
