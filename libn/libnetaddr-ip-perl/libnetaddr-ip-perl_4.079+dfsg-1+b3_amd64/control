Description: IP address manipulation module
 NetAddr::IP provides an object-oriented abstraction on top of IP addresses
 or IP subnets, that allows for easy manipulations.
 .
 The internal representation of all IP objects is in 128 bit IPv6 notation.
 IPv4 and IPv6 objects may be freely mixed.
 .
 The following operations are supported:
 Basic IP conversion, netmask manipulation, subnet interpretation, bitwise
 mask generation, full mask generation, subnet manipulation, expansion, and
 range operations, sub/supernet tests, data type determination, and more
 complex operations such as expansion of netblocks into arrays of smaller
 blocks of arbitrary size, and CIDR block aggregation
