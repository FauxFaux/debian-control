Description: Near Field Communication (NFC) examples for PN53x chips only
 libnfc is a library for Near Field Communication. It abstracts the
 low-level details of communicating with the devices away behind an
 easy-to-use high-level API.
 It supports most hardware based on the NXP PN531, PN532 or PN533
 controller chips.
 .
 Some PN53x-only examples are provided with libnfc for debugging
 and/or educational purposes (pn53x-sam, pn53x-tamashell, etc.).
