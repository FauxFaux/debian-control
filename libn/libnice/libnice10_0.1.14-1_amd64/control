Description: ICE library (shared library)
 Nice is an implementation of the IETF's draft Interactive Connectivity
 Establishment standard (ICE).  ICE is useful for applications that want to
 establish peer-to-peer UDP data streams. It automates the process of
 traversing NATs and provides security against some attacks.
 .
 Existing standards that use ICE include the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
 and the Jingle XMPP extension for audio/video calls.
 .
 Nice includes integration with GStreamer.
 .
 This package provides the nice library.
