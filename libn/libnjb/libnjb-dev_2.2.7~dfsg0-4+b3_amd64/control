Description: Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox library development files
 libnjb is a C library and API for communicating with the Creative
 NOMAD JukeBox and Dell DJ digital audio. The protocol these devices
 use is presumably called PDE (Portable Digital Entertainment protocol)
 at Creative. Newer devices using the Microsoft MTP (Media Transfer
 Protocol) are not supported.
 .
 This package contains the headers and development libraries.
