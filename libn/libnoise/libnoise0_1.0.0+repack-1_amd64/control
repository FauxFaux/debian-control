Description: Portable, coherent noise-generating library for C++
 libnoise is a portable C++ library that is used to generate coherent noise,
 a type of smoothly-changing noise. libnoise can generate Perlin noise,
 ridged multifractal noise, and other types of coherent-noise. Coherent noise
 is often used by graphics programmers to generate natural-looking textures,
 planetary terrain, and other things.
