Description: NSS module for using bind9's lwres as a naming service
 This package provides a Name Service Switch module that allows bind9's
 lightweight resolver to act as a name service. It is intended to replace the
 Name Service Switch module that uses the bind4/bind8 resolver for name service
 lookups.
