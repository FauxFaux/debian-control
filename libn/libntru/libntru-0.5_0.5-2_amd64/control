Description: C implementation of the public-key encryption scheme NTRUEncrypt
 This library is an implementation of the NTRU encryption scheme in C. The
 NTRUEncrypt public key cryptosystem, also known as the NTRU encryption
 algorithm, is a lattice-based alternative to RSA and ECC and is based on the
 shortest vector problem in a lattice (which is not known to be breakable
 using quantum computers).
