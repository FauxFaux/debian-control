Description: module to convert byte count to human readable format and back
 Number::Bytes::Human provides a formatter which turns byte counts to
 usual readable format, like '2.0K' or '3.1GiB', as well as a parser to
 go the opposite way. It was inspired by the -h option of Unix utilities
 like du and df for "human-readable" output.
