Description: module for performing numeric comparisons in Perl
 Number::Compare allows one to compile a simple comparison to an anonymous
 subroutine, which can then be called with a value to be tested against.
 .
 The advantage of using this module is that it understands both the SI prefixes
 'k', 'M', and 'G', as well as the IEC binary prefixes 'Ki', 'Mi' and 'Gi'.
