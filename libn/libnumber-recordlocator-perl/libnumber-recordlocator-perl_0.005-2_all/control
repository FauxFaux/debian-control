Description: Perl module that encodes integers into a short "locator string"
 Number::RecordLocator encodes integers into a 32 character "alphabet"
 designed to be short and easy to read and pronounce. The encoding maps:
 .
     0 to O
     1 to I
     S to F
     B to P
 .
 With a 32 bit encoding, you can map 33.5 million unique ids into a 5
 character code.
