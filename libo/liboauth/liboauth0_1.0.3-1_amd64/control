Description: C library implementing OAuth Core 1.0a API (runtime)
 OAuth (Open Authorization) is an authentication protocol that allows
 users to approve a client (such as a Twitter third-party app) to act on
 their behalf without sharing their password. liboauth provides basic
 functions to escape and encode parameters according to the OAuth Core
 1.0a API, and offers high-level functions to sign requests or verify
 signatures.
