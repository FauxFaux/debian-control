Description: interface to create per object accessors
 Object::Accessor provides an interface to create per object accessors (as
 opposed to per Class accessors, as, for example, Class::Accessor provides).
 .
 You can choose to either subclass this module, and thus using its accessors
 on your own module, or to store an Object::Accessor object inside your own
 object, and access the accessors from there.
