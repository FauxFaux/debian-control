Description: module that provides a simple object container
 Object::Container is an object container with an OO interface. It is
 used to make singletons out of ordinary classes.
 .
 For example, if you want to have a single instance of WWW::Mechanize
 throughout a program, you can do
 Object::Container->register('WWW::Mechanize') somewhere and then you
 can retrieve that instance of WWW::Mechanize from anywhere else with
 Object::Container->get('WWW::Mechanize');
 .
 Class::Singleton is a similar module, which makes subclasses
 singletons. Unlike Class::Singleton, Object::Container can make any
 class a singleton.
 .
 Object::Registrar is another similar module, but it does not support
 lazy loading.
