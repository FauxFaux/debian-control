Description: Perl objects as Hash, Array, Scalar, Code and Glob at once
 The Object::MultiType module returns an object that works like a Hash,
 Array, Scalar, Code and Glob object at the same time.  It uses tie and
 override magic to expose to the perl level the intrinsic typeglob-ness
 of all references. If this does not make sense to you, you probably will
 not be using it directly, although you may wind up installing it as a
 dependency of something else.
