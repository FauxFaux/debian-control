Description: module for building classes, simply
 Object::Tiny is a Perl module for building classes as simply as possible. It
 is useful for rapid prototyping, especially for data classes with a simple
 structure and mostly read-only accessors. It is a minimalistic way to build
 classes, intentionally omitting complex features that interfere with the way
 you build modules.
