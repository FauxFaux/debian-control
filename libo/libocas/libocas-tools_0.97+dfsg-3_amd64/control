Description: Standalone applications implementing the OCAS solver
 This library implements Optimized Cutting Plane Algorithm (OCAS) for
 training linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers from
 large-scale data. The computational effort of OCAS scales linearly with
 the number of training examples. It is one of the fastest SVM solvers
 around for solving linear and multiclass L2 regularized SVMs.
 .
 This package contains the standalone applications.
