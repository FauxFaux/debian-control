Description: Boost ODB runtime library
 ODB is an object-relational mapping (ORM) system for C++. It provides
 tools, APIs, and library support that allow you to persist C++ objects to
 a relational database (RDBMS) without having to deal with tables, columns,
 or SQL and without manually writing any of the mapping code.
 .
 This package contains the Boost ODB profile library. The Boost profile
 provides support for persisting Boost smart pointers, containers, and
 value types with the ODB system.
