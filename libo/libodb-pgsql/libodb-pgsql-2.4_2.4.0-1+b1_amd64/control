Description: ODB Runtime Library for PostgreSQL
 ODB is an object-relational mapping (ORM) system for C++. It provides
 tools, APIs, and library support that allow you to persist C++ objects to
 a relational database (RDBMS) without having to deal with tables, columns,
 or SQL and without manually writing any of the mapping code.
 .
 This package contains the PostgreSQL ODB runtime library. Every application
 that includes code generated for the PostgreSQL database will need to link to
 this library.
