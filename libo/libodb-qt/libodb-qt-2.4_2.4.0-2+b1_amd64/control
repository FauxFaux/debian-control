Description: Qt ODB runtime library
 ODB is an object-relational mapping (ORM) system for C++. It provides
 tools, APIs, and library support that allow you to persist C++ objects to
 a relational database (RDBMS) without having to deal with tables, columns,
 or SQL and without manually writing any of the mapping code.
 .
 This package contains the Qt profile library. The Qt profile provides
 support for persisting Qt smart pointers, containers, and value types
 with the ODB system.
