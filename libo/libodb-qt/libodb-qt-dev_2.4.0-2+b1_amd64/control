Description: Qt ODB runtime library (development)
 ODB is an object-relational mapping (ORM) system for C++. It provides
 tools, APIs, and library support that allow you to persist C++ objects to
 a relational database (RDBMS) without having to deal with tables, columns,
 or SQL and without manually writing any of the mapping code.
 .
 This package contains libraries and header files for developing
 applications that use libodb-qt .
