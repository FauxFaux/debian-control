Description: Library for playing OGG multimedia (development files)
 liboggplay was designed to allow drop-in playback of Xiph.Org media in an
 application. liboggplay handles demuxing and decoding, generates timestamps for
 raw data, maintains synchronisation across multiple streams, and provides a
 lock-free buffer implementation for easy multithreading.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static libraries required for
 developing applications that use liboggplay.
