Description: HTTP+HTTP/2 client for Android and Java applications
 OkHttp is an HTTP client that’s efficient by default. It supports both
 synchronous blocking calls and async calls with callbacks.
  * HTTP/2 support allows all requests to the same host to share a socket.
  * Connection pooling reduces request latency (if HTTP/2 isn’t available).
  * Transparent GZIP shrinks download sizes.
  * Response caching avoids the network completely for repeat requests
