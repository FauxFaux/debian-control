Description: implementation of OpenMAX IL, run-time library
 OpenMAX Integration Layer (IL) is a standard API to access Multimedia
 Components on mobile platforms. It has been defined by the Khronos
 group.  By means of the OpenMAX IL API, multimedia frameworks can
 access hardware accelerators on platforms that provide it.
 .
 Bellagio is an opensource implementation of the OpenMAX IL API that
 runs on Linux.
 .
 It is intended to show the usage of the IL API and to allow people to
 start developing components.
 .
 This package provides the OpenMAX IL core shared library with a
 "reference" component.
