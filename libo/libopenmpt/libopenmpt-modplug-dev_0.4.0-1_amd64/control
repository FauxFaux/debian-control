Description: module music library based on OpenMPT -- modplug compat development files
 libopenmpt is a cross-platform C++ and C library to decode tracked music
 files (modules) into a raw PCM audio stream. It is based on the player code
 of the OpenMPT project, a descendant of the original ModPlug Tracker.
 .
 This package contains the development files required to compile programs
 using libopenmpt's modplug compatibility layer. It serves as an alternative
 to the libmodplug-dev package.
