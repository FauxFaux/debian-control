Description: module music library based on OpenMPT -- modplug compat library
 libopenmpt is a cross-platform C++ and C library to decode tracked music
 files (modules) into a raw PCM audio stream. It is based on the player code
 of the OpenMPT project, a descendant of the original ModPlug Tracker.
 .
 This package contains the modplug compatibility shared library. It is used by
 programs that want to use libopenmpt's decoder, but are written using
 libmodplug's API.
