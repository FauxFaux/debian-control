Description: module for working with Open Document Format files
 OpenOffice::OODoc is a Perl module for reading from/writing to files that
 comply with the OASIS Open Document Format for Office Applications (ODF),
 also known as the ISO/IEC 26300:2006 standard. It provides a high-level,
 document-oriented language, and isolates the programmer from the details
 of the file format.
 .
 This module can process different document classes (texts, spreadsheets,
 presentations, and drawings). It can retrieve or update styles and images,
 document metadata, as well as text content.
