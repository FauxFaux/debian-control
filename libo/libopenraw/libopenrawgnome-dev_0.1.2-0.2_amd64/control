Description: GNOME integration for libopenraw - development files
 libopenraw is an ongoing project to provide a free software implementation for
 camera RAW files decoding. One of the main reason is that dcraw is not suited
 for easy integration into applications, and there is a need for an easy to use
 API to build free software digital image processing application.
 .
 It also has the goal to address missing feature from dcraw like meta-data
 decoding and easy thumbnail extraction.
 .
 This package contains the development header files.
