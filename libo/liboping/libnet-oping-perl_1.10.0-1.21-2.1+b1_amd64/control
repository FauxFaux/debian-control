Description: module for ICMP latency measurement
 Net::Oping is a Perl module for sending ICMP ECHO_REQUESTs (better known as
 "ping packets") and measuring the time that elapses until the reception of an
 ICMP ECHO_REPLY packet (also known as "pong"). It supports pinging multiple
 hosts in parallel using IPv4 or IPv6 transparently.
