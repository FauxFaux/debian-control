Description: sends ICMP_ECHO requests to network hosts
 oping uses ICMP packages (better known as "ping packets") to test the
 reachability of network hosts. It supports pinging multiple hosts in parallel
 using IPv4 and/or IPv6 transparently.
 .
 This package contains two command line applications: "oping" is a replacement
 for tools like ping(1), ping6(1) and fping(1). "noping" is an ncurses-based
 tool which displays statistics while pinging and highlights aberrant
 round-trip times.
