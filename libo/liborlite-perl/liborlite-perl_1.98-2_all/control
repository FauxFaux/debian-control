Description: lightweight SQLite-specific ORM
 ORLite is a Perl module that implements an object-relational mapper designed
 specifically for SQLite. It follows many of the same principles as the ::Tiny
 series of modules and has a design that aligns directly to the capabilities
 of SQLite.
 .
 ORLite discovers the schema of a SQLite database, and then deploys a set of
 packages for talking to that database.
