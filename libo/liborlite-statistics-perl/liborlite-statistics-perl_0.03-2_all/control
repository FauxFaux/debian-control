Description: ORLite extension providing simple statistics
 ORLite::Statistics provides easy integration with the Statistics::Basic set
 of modules (see libstatistics-basic-perl). It enables some basic statistical
 analysis by generating a vector for a particular method, which can then be
 used for any number of things, like determining the median, mean, standard
 deviation and other basic descriptive statistics.
