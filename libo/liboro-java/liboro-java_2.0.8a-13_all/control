Description: Regular expression library for Java
 The Jakarta-ORO Java classes are a set of text-processing Java classes
 that provide Perl5 compatible regular expressions, AWK-like regular
 expressions, glob expressions, and utility classes for performing
 substitutions, splits, filtering filenames, etc.
 ORO is faster and more functional than gnu.regexp.
