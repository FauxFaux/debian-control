Description: Osmo codec library
 This is part of the libosmocore "meta"-library. The libosmocore library
 contains various utility functions that were originally developed as part of
 the OpenBSC project, but which are of a more generic nature and thus useful to
 (at least) other programs that are developed in the sphere of Free Software /
 Open Source mobile communication.
 .
 The libosmocodec library in particular contains the implementation of multiple
 GSM codecs:
 .
  - GSM 06.10 - GSM FR Codec
  - GSM 06.20 - GSM HR Codec
  - GSM 06.60 - GSM EFR Codec
  - GSM 06.90 - GSM AMR Codec
