Description: Utilities for gsm
 This package contains a program for frequency calculation for GSM called
 'osmo-arfcn' and a program called 'osmo-auc-gen' that is used for testing GSM
 authentication.
 .
 They use the libosmocore library. The libosmocore library contain various
 utility functions that were originally developed as part of the OpenBSC
 project, but which are of a more generic nature and thus useful to (at least)
 other programs that are developed in the sphere of Free Software / Open Source
 mobile communication.
