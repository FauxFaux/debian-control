Description: Osmo Core library
 This is part of the libosmocore "meta"-library. The libosmocore library
 contains various utility functions that were originally developed as part of
 the OpenBSC project, but which are of a more generic nature and thus useful to
 (at least) other programs that are developed in the sphere of Free Software /
 Open Source mobile communication.
 .
 The libosmocore11 library in particular is a collection of common code used in
 various sub-projects inside the Osmocom family of projects.
