Description: Open Source MObile COMmunications CORE library (metapackage)
 The libraries provided by this package contain various utility functions.
 These were originally developed as part of the
 OpenBSC project but are of a more generic nature and thus useful to (at
 least) other programs that are developed in the sphere of Free Software / Open
 Source mobile communication.
