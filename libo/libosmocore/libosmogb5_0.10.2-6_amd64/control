Description: Osmo GPRS GB library
 This is part of the libosmocore "meta"-library. The libosmocore library
 contains various utility functions that were originally developed as part of
 the OpenBSC project, but which are of a more generic nature and thus useful to
 (at least) other programs that are developed in the sphere of Free Software /
 Open Source mobile communication.
 .
 The libosmogb library in particular contains a GPRS BSSGP protocol
 implementation.
