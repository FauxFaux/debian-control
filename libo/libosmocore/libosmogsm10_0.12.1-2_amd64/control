Description: Osmo GSM utility library
 This is part of the libosmocore "meta"-library. The libosmocore library
 contains various utility functions that were originally developed as part of
 the OpenBSC project, but which are of a more generic nature and thus useful to
 (at least) other programs that are developed in the sphere of Free Software /
 Open Source mobile communication.
 .
 The libosmogsm library in particular is a collection of common code used in
 various GSM related sub-projects inside the Osmocom family of projects. It
 includes A5/1 and A5/2 ciphers, COMP128v1, a LAPDm implementation, a GSM TLV
 parser, SMS utility routines as well as protocol definitions for a series of
 protocols.
