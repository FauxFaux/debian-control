Description: Library for handling OpenType Font - development
 The libotf library provides the following facilities:
  - Read Open Type Layout Tables from OTF file.  Currently these
    tables are supported; head, name, cmap, GDEF, GSUB, and GPOS.
  - Convert a Unicode character sequence to a glyph code sequence by
    using the above tables.
 .
 The combination of libotf and the FreeType library (Ver.2) realizes
 CTL (complex text layout) by OpenType fonts.
 .
 This package contains the header and development files needed to build
 programs and packages using libotf.
