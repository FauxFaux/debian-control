Description: libotf libraries and debugging symbols
 The libotf library provides the following facilities:
  - Read Open Type Layout Tables from OTF file.  Currently these
    tables are supported; head, name, cmap, GDEF, GSUB, and GPOS.
  - Convert a Unicode character sequence to a glyph code sequence by
    using the above tables.
 .
 The combination of libotf and the FreeType library (Ver.2) realizes
 CTL (complex text layout) by OpenType fonts.
 .
 This package contains unstripped shared libraries. it is provided
 primarily to provide a backtrace with names in a debugger, this makes
 it somewhat easier to interpret core dumps.  The libraries are installed
 in /usr/lib/debug and can be used by placing that directory in
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
 Most people will not need this package.
