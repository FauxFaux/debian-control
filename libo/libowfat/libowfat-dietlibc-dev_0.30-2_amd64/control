Description: Reimplementation of libdjb, dietlibc version
 This library is a reimplementation of libdjb, which means that it provides
 Daniel Bernstein's interfaces (with some extensions).
 .
 It contains wrappers around memory allocation, buffered I/O, routines for
 formatting and scanning, a full DNS resolver, several socket routines,
 wrappers for socket functions, mkfifo, opendir, wait, and an abstraction
 around errno.  It also includes wrappers for Unix signal functions and a
 layer of mmap and sendfile.
 .
 This package contains libowfat linked with dietlibc.
