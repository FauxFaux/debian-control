Description: OpenSSL 1.1 engine for PKCS#11 modules
 With this engine for OpenSSL you can use OpenSSL library
 and command line tools with any PKCS#11 implementation as
 backend for the crypto operations.
 .
 Engine_pkcs11 was developed for smart cards, and mostly
 for the OpenSC PKCS#11 module, but it should work fine with
 any PKCS#11 implementation.
 .
 Engine_pkcs11 is a spin off from OpenSC and replaced
 libopensc-openssl.
