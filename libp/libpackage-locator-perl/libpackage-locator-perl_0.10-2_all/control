Description: module to find a package among CPAN-like repositories
 Package::Locator attempts to answer the question: "Where a distribution that
 will provide this package?" The answer is divined by searching the indexes
 for one or more CPAN-like repositories. If you also provide a specific
 version number, Package::Locator will attempt to find a distribution with
 that version of the package, or higher. You can also ask to find the latest
 version of a package across all the indexes.
 .
 Package::Locator only looks at the index files for each repository, and those
 indexes only contain information about the latest versions of the packages
 within that repository. So Package::Locator is not BackPAN magic -- you
 cannot use it to find precisely which distribution a particular package (or
 file) came from.
