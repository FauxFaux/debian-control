Description: collection of package manipulation utilities
 Package::Pkg is a Perl module that provides several utility functions useful
 for manipulating packages and their subroutines. You can install arbitrary
 code references as functions in a given namespace, alias functions from one
 package to another, and set up an exporter.
 .
 In many respects, this package provides functionality similar to Sub::Install
 (see libsub-install-perl) and Sub::Exporter (see libsub-exporter-perl).
