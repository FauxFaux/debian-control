Description: PAM module for local authenticaction with bluetooth devices
 pam_blue is a dynamically loadable binary object for the PAM security
 framework in Linux. It is presented as an extension for the common PAM
 modules, gives the user the ability for authenticate via a
 Bluetooth-compatible device like a cell phone or other bluetooth
 dongles (e.g. epox-presenter). Due to the fact that a whole part of
 the Bluetooth stack is implemented in hardware-side it is relatively
 difficult to change the Bluetooth hardware MAC address which makes
 this module more secure.
