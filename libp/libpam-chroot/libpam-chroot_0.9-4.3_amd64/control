Description: Chroot Pluggable Authentication Module for PAM
 This package includes a special (but not thoroughly tested) PAM
 module to provide chrooted (restricted) environments for users.
 The module tries to provide a transparent wrapper around the
 average user, one that puts them in a fake file-system (eg, their
 '/' is really /some/where/else).
 .
 In order to setup this environment in Debian please read the
 README.Debian as well as the detailed example provided in
 /usr/share/doc/libpam-chroot/examples
