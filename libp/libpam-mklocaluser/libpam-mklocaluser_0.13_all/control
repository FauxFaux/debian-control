Description: Configure PAM to create a local user if it do not exist already
 When the user log in for the first time, a local user is created in
 /etc/passwd and primary group created in /etc/group, and a local home
 directory is created in /home.  This is useful on roaming computers when
 the password is set up to be cached by for example libpam-ccreds or sssd
 to allow login without network connectivity using the password provided
 by a network authentication service like Kerberos or LDAP.
