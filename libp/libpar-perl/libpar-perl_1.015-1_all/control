Description: Perl redistributable module packaging framework
 PAR is a Perl framework which allows you to easily bundle a typical blib/
 tree into a compressed file (currently a zip) called a Perl Archive. This
 makes it fairly simple to redistribute, even providing support for loading
 C/XS modules by overriding DynaLoader's bootstrapping methods. It writes a
 shared object file to a temporary file at the time it is needed.
