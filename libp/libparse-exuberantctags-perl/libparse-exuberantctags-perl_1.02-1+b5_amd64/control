Description: exuberant ctags parser for Perl
 Parse::ExuberantCTags parses ctags files and handles both traditional
 ctags as well as extended ctags files such as produced with Exuberant
 ctags. It does not handle emacs-style "etags" files.
 .
 The module is implemented as a wrapper around the readtags library
 that normally ships with Exuberant ctags. If you do not know what
 that is, you are encouraged to have a look at
 http://ctags.sourceforge.net/ and look at the exuberant-ctags
 package.
