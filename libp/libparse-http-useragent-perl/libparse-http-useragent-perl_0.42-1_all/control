Description: parser for the HTTP User Agent string
 Parse::HTTP::UserAgent implements a rules-based parser and tries to
 identify MSIE, FireFox, Opera, Safari & Chrome first. It then tries to
 identify Mozilla, Netscape, Robots and the rest will be tried with a
 generic parser. There is also a structure dumper, useful for debugging.
