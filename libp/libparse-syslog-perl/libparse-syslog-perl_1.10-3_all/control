Description: perl module for parsing syslog entries
 Unix syslogs are convenient to read for humans but because of small
 differences between operating systems and things like 'last message
 repeated xx times' not very easy to parse by a script.
 .
 Parse::Syslog presents a simple interface to parse syslog files: you
 create a parser on a file (with new) and call next to get one line at
 a time with Unix-timestamp, host, program, pid and text returned in a
 hash-reference.
