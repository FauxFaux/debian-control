Description: Perl module for parsing Windows registry files
 Parse::Win32Registry is a module for parsing Windows Registry files, allowing
 you to read the keys and values of a registry file without going through the
 Windows API.
 .
 It provides an object-oriented interface to the keys and values in a registry
 file. Registry files are structured as trees of keys, with each key
 containing further subkeys or values.
 .
 It supports both Windows NT registry files (Windows NT, 2000, XP, 2003,
 Vista) and Windows 95 registry files (Windows 95, 98, and Millennium
 Edition).
