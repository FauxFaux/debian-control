Description: mathematical expression parser for Java
 Parsington is an infix-to-postfix (or infix-to-syntax-tree) expression
 parser for mathematical expressions written in Java. It is simple yet
 fancy, handling (customizable) operators, functions, variables and
 constants in a similar way to what the Java language itself supports.
