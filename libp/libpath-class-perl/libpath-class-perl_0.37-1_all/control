Description: module for cross-platform path specification manipulation
 Path::Class is a module for manipulation of file and directory specifications
 (strings describing their locations; for example: '/home/ken/foo.txt') in a
 cross-platform manner. It supports pretty much every platform Perl runs on,
 including Unix, Windows, Mac, VMS, Epoc, Cygwin, OS/2 and NetWare.
 .
 Path::Class uses File::Spec internally, wrapping all the unsightly details so
 you can concentrate on your application code. Path::Class provides an object
 model of path specifications and their semantics. In other words, it creates
 objects representing files and directories, and provides methods that relate
 them to each other.
