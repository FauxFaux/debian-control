Description: Perl module to find a development source tree somewhere in an upper hierarchy
 Path::FindDev provides an easy and platform-independent way to find the
 root of a development source tree in some parent directory, irrespective
 of which test you put it in, and regardless of what $CWD happens to be
 when you call it.  Path::FindDev is mostly a glue layer around
 Path::IsDev with a few directory walking tricks.
