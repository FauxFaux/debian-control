Description: Perl module to determine if a given Path resembles a development source tree
 Path::IsDev is more or less a bunch of heuristics for determining if a
 given path is a development tree root of some kind. This has many
 useful applications, notably ones that require behaviours for
 "installed" modules to be different to those that are still "in
 development".
