Description: Portable Coroutine Library (PCL), development files
 Coroutines are a very simple cooperative multitasking environment where
 the switch from one task to another is done explicitly by a function
 call. Coroutines are a lot faster than processes or threads switch,
 since there is no OS kernel involvement for the operation. Also
 coroutines require much less OS resources than processes of threads.
 .
 For a more complete definition of the term coroutine see The Art of
 Computer Programming by Donald E. Knuth.
 .
 This package contains the static library and header files used in
 development, plus developer's documentation.
