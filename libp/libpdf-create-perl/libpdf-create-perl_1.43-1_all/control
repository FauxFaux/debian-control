Description: Perl module to create PDF files
 PDF::Create allows you to create documents in the Portable Document Format
 (PDF) using a large number of primitives, and emit the result as a PDF file
 or stream.
 .
 Documents can have several pages, a table of content, an information section
 and many other PDF elements. Since documents are constructed on-the-fly, the
 memory footprint is not tied to the size of the pages; only the number of
 pages.
 .
 It is intended to be simple and highly portable, as it is written purely in
 Perl. For more complex tasks, see libpdf-api2-perl.
