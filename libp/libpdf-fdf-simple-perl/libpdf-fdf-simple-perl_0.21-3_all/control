Description: Perl module to read and write (Acrobat) FDF files
 PDF::FDF::Simple helps creating and extracting the content of FDF files. It
 is meant to be a simple replacement for the Adobe FdfToolkit. Therefore some
 of its behavior, especially handling of diverse whitespace/newline artefacts,
 is orientated on FdfToolkit's handling.
 .
 After the extraction process the content is available within a hash
 reference.
 .
 For creating FDF files it currently only supports setting text
 values. Anyway, this should be enough to create FDF files for text
 fields, text areas, checkboxes and radio buttons.
 .
 PDF::FDF::Simple uses Parse::RecDescent and understands both the
 "Kids" notation and the "dotted" notation for field names. Saving will
 always use the "dotted" notation.
