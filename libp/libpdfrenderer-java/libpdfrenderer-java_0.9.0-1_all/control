Description: Java PDF renderer and viewer
 The PDF Renderer is just what the name implies: an open source, all
 Java library which renders PDF documents to the screen using Java2D.
 Typically this means drawing into a Swing panel, but it could also draw
 to other Graphics2D implementations. It could be used to draw on top of
 PDFs, share them over a network, convert PDFs to PNG images, or maybe
 even project PDFs into a 3D scene.
