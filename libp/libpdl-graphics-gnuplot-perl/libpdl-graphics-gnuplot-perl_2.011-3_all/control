Description: gnuplot-based plotting backend for PDL
 PDL::Graphics::Gnuplot allows PDL data to be plotted using Gnuplot as a backend
 for 2D and 3D plotting and image display.
 .
 It is not necessary to understand the gnuplot syntax to generate basic, or
 even complex, plots - though the full syntax is available for advanced users
 who want the full flexibility of the Gnuplot backend.
 .
 Gnuplot recognizes both hard-copy and interactive plotting devices, and on
 interactive devices (like X11) it is possible to pan, scale, and rotate both
 2-D and 3-D plots interactively. You can also enter graphical data through
 mouse clicks on the device window.
