Description: Netcdf-IO for PDL
 PDL::NetCDF provides the PDL interface to the Unidata NetCDF library.
 It uses the netCDF version 3 library to make a subset of netCDF functionality
 available to PDL users in a clean, object-oriented interface.
 .
 The NetCDF standard allows N-dimensional binary data to be efficiently
 stored, annotated and exchanged between many platforms.
 .
 When one creates a new netCDF object, this object is associated with one
 netCDF file.
