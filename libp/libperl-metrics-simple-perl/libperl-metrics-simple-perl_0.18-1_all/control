Description: module to provide metrics of Perl code
 Perl::Metrics::Simple is a Perl module that provides several useful methods
 for static analysis of one or many Perl files. It currently offers these
 metrics: packages, subroutines, lines of code, and an approximation of
 cyclomatic (mccabe) complexity for the subroutines and the "main" portion
 of the code.
 .
 This module is designed to be simpler than the similar Perl::Metric module.
