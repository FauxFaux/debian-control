Description: implementation of the Perl 6 'is export(...)' trait
 Perl6::Export prototypes the Perl 6 'exported' and 'exportable' traits
 in Perl 5.
 .
 Instead of messing around with @EXPORT arrays, you just declare which
 subs are to be exported (or are exportable on request) as part of
 those subs.
