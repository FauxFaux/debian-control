Description: Perl 5 implementation of the Perl 6 'form' built-in
 Formats are Perl 5's mechanism for creating text templates with
 fixed-width fields. Those fields are then filled in using values from
 prespecified package variables.
 .
 Unlike Perl 5, Perl 6 doesn't have a C<format> keyword. Or the
 associated built-in formatting mechanism. Instead it has a Form.pm
 module. And a C<form> function.
 .
 The Perl6::Form module implements virtually all of the functionality of the
 Perl 6 Form.pm module.
