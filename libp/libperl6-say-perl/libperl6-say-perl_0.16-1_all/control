Description: module to print without newline needed
 Perl6::Say implements a close simulation of the say function in Perl 6, which
 acts like print but automatically appends a newline.
 .
 Use it just like print (except that it only supports the indirect
 object syntax when the stream is a bareword).
 .
 Since perl 5.10, you don't need this module.  The Perl 6 say function is
 available in Perl 5.10 by saying "use feature 'say';".
