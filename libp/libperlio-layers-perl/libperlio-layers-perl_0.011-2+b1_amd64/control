Description: Perl module to query a filehandle's capabilities
 Perl's filehandles are implemented as a stack of layers, with the bottom-most
 usually doing the actual IO and the higher ones doing buffering,
 encoding/decoding or transformations. PerlIO::Layers allows you to query the
 filehandle's properties concerning these layers.
