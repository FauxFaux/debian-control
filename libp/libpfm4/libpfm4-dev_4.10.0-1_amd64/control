Description: Development files for the libpfm4 library
 Libpfm4 helps convert from an event name, expressed as a string, to
 the event encoding. The encoding can then be used with specific OS
 interfaces. Libpfm4 also provides OS-specific interfaces to directly
 setup OS-specific data structures to be passed to the kernel. The
 current libpfm4, for instance, provides support for the perf_events
 interface which was introduced in Linux v2.6.31.
 .
 This package provides the development files of the library.
