Description: base class for PG Object subclasses
 PGObject contains the base routines for object management using discoverable
 stored procedures in PostgreSQL databases. PGObject contains only common
 functionality and support structures, and low-level API's. Most developers
 will want to use more functional modules which add to these functions.
 .
 The overall approach here is to provide the basics for a toolkit that other
 modules can extend. This is thus intended to be a component for building
 integration between PostgreSQL user defined functions and Perl objects.
 .
 Because decisions such as state handling are largely outside of the scope of
 this module, this module itself does not do any significant state handling.
 Database handles (using DBD::Pg 2.0 or later) must be passed in on every
 call. This decision was made in order to allow for diversity in this area,
 with the idea that wrapper classes would be written to implement this.
