Description: DateTime Wrappers for PGObject
 PGObject::Type::DateTime provides a basic wrapper around DateTime to allow
 PGObject-framework types to automatically tie date/time related objects, but
 date and timestamp formats are handled in the 'from_db' routines.
 .
 This specific module only supports the ISO YMD datestyle. The MDY or DMY
 datestyles may be usable in future versions but datestyles other than ISO
 raise ambiguity issues, sufficient that they cannot always even be used in
 PostgreSQL as input.
 .
 This module also provides basic default handling. Times are assigned a date
 of '0001-01-01' and dates are assigned a time of midnight. Whether this is
 set is persisted, along with whether timezones are set, and these are
 returned to a valid ISO YMD format on export, if a date component was
 initially set.
 .
 This means you can use this for general math without worrying about many of
 the other nicities. Parsing ISO YMD dates and standard times (24 hr format)
 is supported via the from_db interface, which also provides a useful way of
 handing dates in.
