Description: PostgreSQL text representations parser
 PostgreSQL can represent tuples and arrays in a text format that is almost
 like CSV. Unfortunately this format has a number of gotchas which render
 existing CSV-parsers useless. PGObject::Util::PseudoCSV provides basic
 parsing functions to other programs for db interface purposes. With this
 module you can both parse pseudocsv representations of tuples and arrays and
 you can create them from a list.
 .
 The API's here assume you send one (and only one) pseudo-csv record to the
 API at once. These may be nested, so a single tuple can contain arrays of
 tuples which can contain arrays of tuples ad infinitum but the parsing only
 goes one layer deep tuple-wise so that handling classes have an opportunity to
 re-parse with appropriate type information. Naturally this has performance
 implications, so depth in SQL structures passed should be reasonably limited.
