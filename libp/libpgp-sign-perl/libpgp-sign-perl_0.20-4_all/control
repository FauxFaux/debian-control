Description: Perl module to create detached PGP signatures
 PGP::Sign creates and checks detached PGP signatures for textual data
 using GnuPG.  Other PGP implementations are also supported with run-time
 configuration.  Secret key passphrases are passed via a pipe, and no
 temporary files are required for signature generation (but are for
 signature verification).
