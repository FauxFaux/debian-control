Description: Flexible and feature-complete PHP client library for the Redis key-value store
 The library does not require any additional extension loaded in PHP but it can
 be optionally paired with the phpiredis (https://github.com/nrk/phpiredis)
 C-based extension to lower the overhead of serializing and parsing the Redis
 protocol. Predis is also available in an asynchronous fashion through the
 experimental client provided by the Predis\Async
 (http://github.com/nrk/predis-async) library.
