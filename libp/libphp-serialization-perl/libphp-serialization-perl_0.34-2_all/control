Description: Perl module to manipulate serialized PHP data structures
 PHP::Serialization provides a simple means of serializing Perl data structures
 (including object data) into PHP's serialized data format. It can also process
 this data as input, in order to read serialized PHP data structures into their
 Perl equivalents. Numeric arrays are mapped to arrays in Perl and vice-versa.
 Similarly, arrays which contain string keys are mapped to hashes in Perl.
