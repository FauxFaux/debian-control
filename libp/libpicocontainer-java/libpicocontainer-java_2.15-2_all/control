Description: Java library implementing the Dependency Injection pattern
 PicoContainer is a highly embeddable full service Inversion of Control (IoC)
 container for components that honour the Dependency Injection pattern. It can
 be used as a lightweight alternative to Sun's J2EE patterns for web
 applications or general solutions.
 .
 Despite it being very compact in size, PicoContainer supports different
 dependency injection types (Constructor, Setter, Annotated Field and Method)
 and offers multiple lifecycle and monitoring strategies.
