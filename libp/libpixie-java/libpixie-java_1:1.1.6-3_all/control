Description: Java Vector Format Viewer Library
 Pixie is a WMF-File reading library originally written as converter for the
 Pixie-ImageViewer. Pixie was long time dead and is now resurrected as
 WMF-Reader and ImageProducer for Java 1.2.2 or higher.
 .
 Pixie lacks the support for most BitMap-Formats but everything else is
 working fine. Write-Support will be implemented somewhere in the future,
 classes for the writesupport are mostly dummies at the moment.
