Description: Pure-Perl Core-Only replacement for pkg-config
 PkgConfig provides a pure-perl, core-only replacement for the
 pkg-config utility.
 While pkg-config is a compiled binary linked with glib,
 the pure-perl version has no such requirement, and will run
 wherever Perl ( >= 5.6 ) does.
 The package provides a pure perl binary called ppkg-config which
 can be used as well as pkg-config.
