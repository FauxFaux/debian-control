Description: Phylogenetic Likelihood Library (development)
 PLL is a highly optimized, parallelized software library to ease the
 development of new software tools dealing with phylogenetic inference.
 .
 Among the functions included in PLL are parsing multiple sequence
 alignments (MSA) from PHYLIP and FASTA files, reading Newick trees,
 performing topological moves such as SPR and NNI, model optimization,
 likelihood evaluation and partitioned analysis by assigning different
 substitution models to each partition of the MSA. PLL fully implements
 the GTR nucleotide substitution model for DNA data and a number of
 models for aminoacid data.
 .
 This package contains the static library and the header file.
