Description: portable mount library - development files
 This library implements functions pmount() and pumount() as wrappers to
 the real mount/unmount unportable interfaces on each platform.
 .
 Its goal is to provide a consistent interface application programmers can
 rely on for mounting and umounting filesystems without having to address
 kernel-related portability problems.
 .
 This package contains the static object and header files of libpmount.
