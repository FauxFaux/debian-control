Description: abstract document tree for Perl POD documents
 Pod::Abstract provides an abstract, tree-based interface to POD documents. It
 allows straightforward, round-trip capable manipulation of POD documentation.
 .
 This also allows an easy tree-based mechanism to write a Pod::<format> type
 filter. The package includes a simple, and extensible, command line utility
 called "paf" (Pod::Abstract Filter). This program can chain together filter
 operations, allowing manipulation and extraction of POD documents from the
 command line.
