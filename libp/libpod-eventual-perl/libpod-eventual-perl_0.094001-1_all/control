Description: module to read a POD as a series of trivial events
 Pod::Eventual is a collection of Perl modules designed to read line-based
 input and produce events describing each POD paragraph or directive it finds.
 Once complete, events are immediately passed to the handle_event method. This
 method should be implemented by subclasses of Pod::Eventual; otherwise the
 default handle_event method will raise an exception.
