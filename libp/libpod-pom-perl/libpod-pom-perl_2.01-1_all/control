Description: module providing a Pod Object Model
 Pod::POM is a Perl Pod document parser that exposes an object model called
 Pod Object Model. The object model is generated as a hierarchical tree of
 nodes, each of which represents a different element of the original document.
 The tree can be walked manually and the nodes examined, printed or otherwise
 manipulated. Pod::POM also provides view objects, which can automatically
 traverse the tree, or section thereof, and generate an output representation
 in one form or another.
