Description: remove POD documentation from Perl code
 Pod::Strip is a subclass of Pod::Simple that removes the POD (plain old
 documentation) from Perl code. The POD may optionally be replaced with
 comments so that line numbers of the code stay the same.
 .
 Pod::Strip is useful in Perl code parsers that don't want to bother about POD.
