Description: POE Component for performing asynchronous DNS queries
 POE::Component::Client::DNS is a wrapper for non-blocking DNS queries based on
 Net::DNS (libnet-dns-perl). It lets other tasks run while something is waiting
 for a nameserver response and allows multiple DNS servers to be queried at the
 same time. DNS client components are spawned as separate sessions rather than
 being created as proper objects; for full details, see the documentation.
