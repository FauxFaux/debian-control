Description: POE component that manages and keeps alive client connections
 POE::Component::Client::Keepalive creates and manages connections for other
 components. It maintains a cache of kept-alive connections for quick reuse.
 It is written specifically for clients that can benefit from kept-alive
 connections, such as HTTP clients. Using it for one-shot connections would
 probably be silly.
