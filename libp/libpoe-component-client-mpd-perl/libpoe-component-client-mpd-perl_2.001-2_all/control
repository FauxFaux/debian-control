Description: client library for MPD (Music Player Daemon)
 POE::Component::Client::MPD is a Perl POE component module that provides a
 clear message passing interface for talking to and controlling Music Player
 Daemon (MPD) servers. A connection to the MPD server is established as soon
 as a new object is created. Commands are then sent to the server as messages
 are passed.
