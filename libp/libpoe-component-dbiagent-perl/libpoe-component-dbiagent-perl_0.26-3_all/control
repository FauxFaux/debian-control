Description: POE Component for running asynchronous DBI calls
 POE::Component::DBIAgent is your answer to non-blocking DBI in POE.
 .
 It fires off a configurable number child processes (defaults to 3) and
 feeds database queries to it via two-way pipe (or sockets ... however
 POE::Component::Wheel::Run is able to manage it).  The primary method
 is query.
