Description: POE Managed Boss/Worker thread pool
 Thread pool expand-on-demand managed through a POE session in a
 manner that does not interfere with cooperative multitasking. A single pipe is
 created, each thread communicates its state to the main process through this
 pipe. No serialization occurs (these are threads, not child processes), so
 execution is very fast.
 .
 This package provides the Perl modules Poe::Component::Pool::Thread.
