Description: POE filter for HTTP clients or servers
 POE::Filter::HTTP::Parser is a filter for the Perl Object Environment (POE)
 system based on HTTP::Parser. It can be used to easily create POE-based HTTP
 servers or clients.
 .
 With the type set to client, which is the default behaviour, 'get' will parse
 HTTP::Response objects from HTTP streams and 'put' will accept HTTP::Request
 objects and convert them to HTTP streams.
 .
 For servers, the reverse will happen; 'get' will parse HTTP::Request objects
 from HTTP streams and 'put' will accept HTTP::Response objects and convert
 them to HTTP streams. If there is an error parsing the request, this filter
 will generate a HTTP::Response object instead, encapsulating an error message
 suitable for simply sending back to the requesting client.
