Description: POE event loop implementation using Event
 POE::Loop::Tk implements the standard POE::Loop event loop interface (see the
 documentation from libpoe-perl) for the Event library (see libevent-perl). It
 provides features needed to manage an Event-based event loop in Perl in a
 consistent fashion and does not differ from the standard interface.
