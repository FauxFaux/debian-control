Description: POE event loop implementation using Tk
 POE::Loop::Tk implements the standard POE::Loop event loop interface for the
 Tk toolkit. It provides features needed to manage a Tk-based event loop in
 Perl in a consistent fashion and does not differ from the standard interface.
 Please see POE::Loop from libpoe-perl for details on how this works.
