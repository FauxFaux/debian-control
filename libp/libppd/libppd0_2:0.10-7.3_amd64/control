Description: postscript PPD file library
 PostScript was designed as a device independent language. To be able
 to access device specific features like selecting different paper
 trays and turning on different imaging models, each printer vendor
 supplies a PostScript Printer Definition or PPD file. This library
 reads those PPD files and provides functions that allow a program to
 modify PostScript print jobs to acces these special features.
