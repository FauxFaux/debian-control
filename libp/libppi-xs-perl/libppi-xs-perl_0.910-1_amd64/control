Description: Perl module to accelerate the Perl Parsing Interface (PPI)
 PPI::XS provides XS-based acceleration of the core PPI packages. It
 selectively replaces a (small but growing) number of methods throughout PPI
 with identical but much faster C versions.
 .
 Once installed, it will be auto-detected and loaded in by PPI completely
 transparently. The integration between the primary (Perl) implementation and
 the XS-accelerated version are designed to degrade gracefully if they fall out
 of sync -- the Perl version is preferred over the XS version.
