Description: utility to extract a name from a PPI Document
 PPIx::DocumentName contains a few utilities for extracting a "name" out of an
 arbitrary Perl file.
 .
 Typically, this is the module name, in the form:
 .
  package Foo
 .
 However, it also supports extraction of an override statement in the form:
 .
  # PODNAME: OverrideName::Goes::Here
 .
 which may be more applicable for documents that lack a package statement, or
 the package statement may be "wrong", but they still need the document parsed
 under the guise of having a name (for purposes such as POD).
