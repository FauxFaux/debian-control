Description: Perl module containing extensions to PPI
 This is a collection of functions for dealing with PPI objects, many of which
 originated in Perl::Critic. They are organized into modules by the kind of
 PPI class they relate to, by replacing the "PPI" at the front of the module
 name with "PPIx::Utilities", e.g. functionality related to PPI::Nodes is in
 PPIx::Utilities::Node.
