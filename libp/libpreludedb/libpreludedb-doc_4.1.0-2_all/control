Description: Security Information and Events Management System [ Documentation ]
 The PreludeDB Library provides an abstraction layer upon the type and the
 format of the database used to store IDMEF alerts. It allows developers to use
 the Prelude IDMEF database easily and efficiently without worrying about SQL,
 and to access the database independently of the type/format of the database.
 .
 This package contains the documentation for developers for
 PreludeDB components.
