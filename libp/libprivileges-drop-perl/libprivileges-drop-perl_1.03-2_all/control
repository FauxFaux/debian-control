Description: module to make it simple to drop all privileges
 Privileges::Drop tries to simplify the process of dropping privileges. This
 can be useful when your Perl program needs to bind to privileged ports, etc.
 This module is much like Proc::UID, except that it's implemented in pure
 Perl. Special care has been taken to also drop saved uid on platforms that
 support this, currently only tested on Linux.
