Description: module to fork+exec, or spawn, a subprocess as quickly as possible
 The purpose of this small (in scope and footprint) module is simple: spawn a
 subprocess asynchronously as efficiently and/or fast as possible. Basically
 the same as calling fork+exec (on POSIX), but hopefully faster than those two
 syscalls.
 .
 Apart from fork overhead, this module also allows you to fork+exec programs
 when otherwise you couldn't - for example, when you use POSIX threads in your
 perl process then it generally isn't safe to call fork from perl, but it is
 safe to use this module to execute external processes.
