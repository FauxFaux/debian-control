Description: module to conveniently terminate processes
 Proc::Terminator provides a convenient way to kill a process, often useful in
 utility and startup functions which need to ensure the death of an external
 process.
 .
 Proc::Terminator provides a simple, blocking, and procedural interface to
 kill a process or multiple processes (not tested), and not return until they
 are all dead.
 .
 Proc::Terminator can know if you do not have permissions to kill a process,
 if the process is dead, and other interesting tidbits.
 .
 It also provides for flexible options in the type of death a process will
 experience. Whether it be slow or immediate.
