Description: Perl module to record progress to any output
 Progress::Any is an interface for applications that want to display progress
 to users. It decouples progress updating and output, rather similar to how
 Log::Any decouples log producers and consumers (output). The API is also
 rather similar to Log::Any, except Adapter is called Output and category is
 called task.
 .
 Progress::Any records position/target and calculates elapsed time, estimated
 remaining time, and percentage of completion. One or more output modules
 (Progress::Any::Output::*) display this information.
