Description: Perl extensions for writing pRPC servers and clients
 Perl RPC simplifies the writing of Perl based client/server
 applications.  RPC::pServer is the package used on the server side,
 and you guess what RPC::pClient is for.  pRPC works by defining a set
 of functions that may be executed by the client.
