Description: Create a binary DAFSA from a Public Suffix List
 libpsl permits the use of an optimized binary representation of the
 Public Suffix List (PSL).  This format is a deterministic acyclic
 finite state automaton, or DAFSA.
 .
 It is primarily used for building a new version of the publicsuffix
 package, but could also be used by anyone else looking to match
 printable US ASCII strings.
 .
 This package contains a Python script to convert a standard PSL into
 a DAFSA, either in C source code form, or in a specialized mmap-able
 binary format.
