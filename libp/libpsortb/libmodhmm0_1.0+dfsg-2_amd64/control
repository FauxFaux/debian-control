Description: library for constructing, training and scoring hidden Markov models
 Library for constructing, training and scoring hidden Markov models.  It
 is provided with PSORTb but might be used separately.
 .
 PSORTb enables prediction of bacterial protein subcellular localization
 (SCL) and provides a quick and inexpensive means for gaining insight
 into protein function, verifying experimental results, annotating newly
 sequenced bacterial genomes, detecting potential cell surface/secreted
 drug targets, as well as identifying biomarkers for microbes.
 .
 This library needed by PSORTb is distributed separately by upstream.
 .
 This package contains the shared library which is needed to run PSORTb.
