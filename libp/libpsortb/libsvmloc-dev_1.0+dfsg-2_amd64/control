Description: PSORTb adapted library for svm machine-learning library (dev)
 Libsvm is a machine-learning library which is an easy-to-use package
 for support vector classification, regression and one-class SVM. It
 supports multi-class classification, probability outputs, and
 parameter selection.
 .
 PSORTb was featuring a code copy plus some local additions.  This
 library is linked against the Debian packaged libsvn and just contains
 the PSORTb extensions.
 .
 PSORTb enables prediction of bacterial protein subcellular localization
 (SCL) and provides a quick and inexpensive means for gaining insight
 into protein function, verifying experimental results, annotating newly
 sequenced bacterial genomes, detecting potential cell surface/secreted
 drug targets, as well as identifying biomarkers for microbes.
 .
 This library needed by PSORTb is distributed separately by upstream.
 .
 This package contains the static library which is needed to link PSORTb.
