 libqglviewer (also known as libQGLViewer) is a free C++ library based on Qt
 that enables the quick creation of OpenGL 3D viewers. It features a powerful

 display, interpolated keyFrames, object selection, and much more. It is fully
 customizable and easy to extend to create complex applications, with a
 possible Qt GUI.
