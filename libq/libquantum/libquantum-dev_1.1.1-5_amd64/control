Description: library for the simulation of a quantum computer (development files)
 libquantum is a C library for the simulation of a quantum computer. Based on
 the principles of quantum mechanics, it provides an implementation of a
 quantum register. Basic operations for register manipulation such as the
 Hadamard gate or the Controlled-NOT gate are available through an easy-to-use
 interface. Measurements can be performed on either single qubits or the whole
 quantum register.
 .
 Features:
  * Simulation of arbitrary quantum algorithms is possible
  * High performance and low memory consumption
  * Decoherence support for realistic quantum computation
  * Interface for quantum error correction (QEC)
  * Supports the density operator formalism
  * Implementations of Shor's factoring algorithm and Grover's search
    algorithm are included
 .
 This package contains the header files and static libraries which are needed
 to develop applications based on libquantum.
