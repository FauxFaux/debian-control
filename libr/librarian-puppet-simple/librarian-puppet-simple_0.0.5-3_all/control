Description: simple version of librarian-puppet with most of its commands
 librarian-puppet-simple was created out of its author's frustration with the
 dependency management in librarian-puppet. Librarian-puppet offers to simplify
 deployment of a Puppet infrastructure by automatically pulling in modules from
 the forge and git repositories with a single command. This package only
 allows one to pin revisions for a collection of modules, and it is also less
 heavy than librarian-puppet.
 .
 librarian-puppet-simple has fewer commands, but they should be compatible with
 the original librarian-puppet.
 .
 Note that you cannot currently install both librarian-puppet and
 librarian-puppet-simple at the same time.
