Description: configuration library for gaming mice
 libratbag is a configuration library for gaming mice. It provides a
 generic way to access the various features exposed by these mice and
 abstracts away hardware-specific and kernel-specific quirks.
 .
 It currently supports some Etekcity and Roccat mice, and most
 Logitech mice (both gaming and generic mice).
