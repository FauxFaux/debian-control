Description: library for direct access to IEEE 1394 bus - development files
 libraw1394 is the only supported interface to the kernel side raw1394
 of the Linux IEEE-1394 subsystem, which provides direct access to the

 applications can directly send to and receive from other nodes without
 requiring a kernel driver for the protocol in question.
