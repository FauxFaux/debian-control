Description: Reference manual and documentation about libraw1394
 libraw1394 is the only supported interface to the kernel side raw1394
 of the Linux IEEE-1394 subsystem, which provides direct access to the
 connected 1394 buses to user space.  Through libraw1394/raw1394,
 applications can directly send to and receive from other nodes without
 requiring a kernel driver for the protocol in question.
 .
 This package contains documentation for libraw1394, as well as
 the programmer's documentation.
