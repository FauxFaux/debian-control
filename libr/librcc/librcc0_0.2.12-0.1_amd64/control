Description: Library for autoconvert codepages
 Originally, the project was aimed to provide means to work with
 multiple encodings
  * Language Autodetection
  * On the fly translation between languages, using online-services!
  * Encoding Autodetection for most of European Languages1
  * Support for encoding detection plugins (besides Enca and LibRCD)
  * Recoding/translation of multi-language playlists!
  * Cache to speed-up re-recoding.
  * Possibility to configure new languages and encodings.
  * Shared configuration file. For example mentioned TagLib and
    LibID3 patches do not have their own user interface, but will
    utilize the same recoding configuration as XMMS.
  * As well the separate program for configuration adjustment is
    available.
  * GTK/GTK2 UI Library: you can add properties page to your GTK+
    application with 3 lines of code.
  * Menu localization opportunity
