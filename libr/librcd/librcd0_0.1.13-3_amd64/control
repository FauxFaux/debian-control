Description: Library for autodection charset of Russian text
 LibRCD is used by RusXMMS project for encoding auto-detection.
 It is optimized to handle very short titles, like ID3 tags,
 file names and etc, and provides very high accuracy even
 for short 3-4 letter words.
 Current version supports Russian and Ukrainian languages
 and able to distinguish UTF-8, KOI8-R, CP1251, CP866, ISO8859-1.
 If compared with Enca, LibRCC provides better detection accuracy
 on short titles and is able to detect ISO8859-1 (non-cyrillic)
 encoding what allows one to properly display correct ID3 v.1 titles.
