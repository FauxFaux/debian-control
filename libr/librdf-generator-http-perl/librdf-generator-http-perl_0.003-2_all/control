Description: Perl module to generate RDF from an HTTP request
 RDF::Generator::HTTP simply takes an HTTP::Message object, and based on its
 content, especially the content the HTTP::Header object(s) it contains,
 creates a simple RDF representation of the contents. It is useful chiefly for
 recording data when crawling resources on the Web, but it may also have other
 uses.
