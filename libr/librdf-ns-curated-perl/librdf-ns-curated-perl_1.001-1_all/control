Description: curated set of RDF prefixes
 RDF::NS::Curated contains a limited list of prefix and URI pairs that
 are commonly used in RDF.  The intention is that prefixes in this list
 can be safely used in code that has a long lifetime.  The list has been
 derived mostly from W3C standards documents, but also some popularity
 lists.
 .
 Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard model for data
 interchange on the Web.
