Description: simple way to turn URIs into QNames
 Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard model for data
 interchange on the Web.
 .
 RDF::Prefixes is not so much for managing namespaces/prefixes in code
 (see RDF::Trine::NamespaceMap for that), but as a helper for code that
 serialises data using namespaces.
 .
 It generates pretty prefixes, reducing "http://purl.org/dc/terms/" to
 "dc" rather than something too generic like "ns01", and provides a
 context for keeping track of namespaces already used, so that when
 "http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" is encountered, it won't stomp on
 the previous definition of "dc".
