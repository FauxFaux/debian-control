Description: avoid all those boring PREFIX definitions
 RDF::QueryX::Lazy is a fairly trivial subclass of RDF::Query that
 auto-defines many prefixes for you, so you can be lazy.  It should have
 most of the common ones in there.
 .
 Oh yeah, and if you want, you can pass a key 'lazy' in the RDF::Query
 %options hash with additional prefix mappings.
