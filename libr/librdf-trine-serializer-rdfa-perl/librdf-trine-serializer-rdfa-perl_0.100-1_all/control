Description: RDFa Serializer for RDF::Trine
 The RDF::Trine::Serializer class provides an API
 for serializing RDF graphs to strings and files.
 This subclass provides RDFa serialization via RDF::RDFa::Generator.
 .
 It is intended that this module will replace
 the RDF::Trine compatibility methods in RDF::RDFa::Generator,
 which are now deprecated.
 This is done to allow both RDF::Trine and Attean to use it,
 but not require them as dependencies.
 .
 RDF::Trine is a Perl framework
 for working with RDF data and SPARQL queries.
 .
 SPARQL is an RDF query language,
 that is, a semantic query language for databases,
 able to retrieve and manipulate data
 stored in Resource Description Framework format.
 .
 Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard model
 for data interchange on the Web.
