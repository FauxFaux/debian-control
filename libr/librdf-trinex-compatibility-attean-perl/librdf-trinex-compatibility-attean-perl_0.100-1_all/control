Description: compatibility layer between Attean and RDF::Trine
 RDF::TrineX::Compatibility::Attean is a compatibility layer
 that is useful for modules that are in transition to Attean,
 in that older modules will be able to use newer code.
 It is for example a dependency for RDFa serialization.
 .
 RDF::Trine and Attean are both Perl frameworks
 for working with RDF data and SPARQL queries,
 the former using Moose and deprecated
 in favor of the latter using Moo.
 .
 SPARQL is an RDF query language,
 that is, a semantic query language for databases,
 able to retrieve and manipulate data
 stored in Resource Description Framework format.
 .
 Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard model
 for data interchange on the Web.
