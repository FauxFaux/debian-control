Description: shortcut functions for RDF::Trine's object-oriented interface
 Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard model for data
 interchange on the Web.
 .
 RDF::Trine provides an RDF framework with an emphasis on extensibility,
 API stability, and the presence of a test suite.
 .
 RDF::TrineX::Functions provides some shortcut functions for RDF::Trine.
 It is a replacement for the venerable RDF::TrineShortcuts. Not a
 drop-in replacement. It has fewer features, fewer dependencies, less
 hackishness, less magic and fewer places it can go wrong.
