Description: RDF/Turtle serializer pleasant for humans to look at
 Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard model for data
 interchange on the Web.
 .
 RDF::Trine provides an RDF framework with an emphasis on extensibility,
 API stability, and the presence of a test suite.
 .
 RDF::TrineX::Serializer::MockTurtleSoup provides an RDF::Trine
 serializer like RDF::Trine::Serializer::Turtle but real pretty.
 .
 And slower.
 .
 And probably breaks with some complex graphs.
