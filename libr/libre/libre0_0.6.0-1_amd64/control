Description: generic library for real-time communications with async IO support
 Libre is a portable and generic library for real-time communications
 with async IO support and a complete SIP stack with support for protocols
 such as SDP, RTP/RTCP, STUN/TURN/ICE, BFCP, HTTP and DNS Client.
 .
 The current features are:
 .
  * SIP Stack (RFC 3261)
  * SDP
  * RTP and RTCP
  * SRTP and SRTCP (Secure RTP)
  * DNS-Client
  * STUN/TURN/ICE stack
  * BFCP
  * HTTP-stack with client/server
  * Websockets
  * Jitter-buffer
  * Async I/O (poll, epoll, select, kqueue)
  * UDP/TCP/TLS/DTLS transport
  * JSON parser
  * Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP)
 .
 Design goals:
 .
  Portable POSIX source code (ANSI C89 and ISO C99 standard)
  Robust, fast, low memory footprint
  RFC compliance
  IPv4 and IPv6 support
