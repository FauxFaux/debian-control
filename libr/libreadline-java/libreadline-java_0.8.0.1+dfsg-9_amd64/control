Description: GNU readline and BSD editline wrappers for Java
 Included is the Java package org.gnu.readline which provides the GNU
 readline and BSD editline libraries for Java.  Note that this is NOT a
 pure Java implementation; it merely contains JNI wrappers for the standard
 system libraries.
 .
 BSD editline resembles GNU readline but is under a more relaxed license.
 In some cases it can be used as a drop-in replacement for GNU readline
 when licensing issues prevent GNU readline from being used.
 .
 The API documentation and examples can be found in libreadline-java-doc.
