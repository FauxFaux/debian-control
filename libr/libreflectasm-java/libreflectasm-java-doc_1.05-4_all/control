Description: library that provides reflection by using code generation - doc
 ReflectASM is a very small Java library that provides high performance
 reflection by using code generation. An access class is generated
 to set/get fields, call methods, or create a new instance.
 .
 The access class uses bytecode rather than Java's reflection,
 so it is much faster. It can also access primitive fields via
 bytecode to avoid boxing.
 .
