Description: Regular expression library for Java
 Regexp is a 100% Pure Java Regular Expression package. Regular expressions
 are pattern descriptions which enable sophisticated matching of strings.
 In addition to being able to match a string against a pattern, you can also
 extract parts of the match. This is especially useful in text parsing!
