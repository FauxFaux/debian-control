Description: LibreOffice Extension to organize a German Law Office
 This program handles records and personal data in a law firm,
 manages hold-files and adds data into documents. Own templates can
 be easily created. They are flexibly managed by this software for advocates.
 All document files belonging to a record are stored in a separate
 (sub-) directory and are managed at this place by the program.
 Canzeley is network-based, but can also be installed and operated on a
 stand-alone computer.
 .
 To install the necessary server, please note the information in
 README.Debian and in the (German) installation manual.
