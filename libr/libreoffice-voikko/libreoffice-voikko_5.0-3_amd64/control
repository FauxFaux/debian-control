Description: Spellchecker, grammar checker and hyphenator for LibreOffice
 LibreOffice is a full-featured office productivity suite that provides
 a near drop-in replacement for Microsoft(R) Office.
 .
 This package contains a libreoffice-voikko, a multi language spellchecker,
 grammar checker and hyphenator extension for LibreOffice. It uses
 libvoikko for all linguistic operations.
 .
 Based on the configuration of libvoikko, spell checking is supported for
 multiple languages. Other features are currently available only for
 Finnish.
 .
 NOTE: Usually spell-checking, grammar checking and hyphenation should be
 automatically activated after installing this package. If this is not the
 case, go to "Writing Aids" settings in LibreOffice and activate Voikko
 components manually.
