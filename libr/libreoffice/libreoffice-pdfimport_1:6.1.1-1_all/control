Description: transitional package for PDF Import component for LibreOffice
 LibreOffice is a full-featured office productivity suite that provides
 a near drop-in replacement for Microsoft(R) Office.
 .
 This package formerly contained a component enabling LibreOffice to import PDF
 Documents. This now has been merged back into the "main" packages and this
 package thus can be safely removed once installed.
