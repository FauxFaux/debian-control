Description: LibreOffice UNO runtime environment
 The Uno Runtime Environment (URE) is the well-known UNO component model
 of LibreOffice, packaged up as an individual product.
 .
 It offers you a flexible, low-overhead component model that is most ideal
 for (but not limited to) combining in one application components written in
 different computer languages, and developed by different parties. You can use
 it to create any kind of application, in whatever application domain you can
 imagine.
