Description: abstraction library for accessing hierachic bulk content
 LibRepository provides a simple abstraction layer to access bulk content that
 is organized in a hierarchical layer.
 .
 Unlike the JSR-000170, this library does not aim to solve all problems
 associated with content storages. The main purpose of LibRepository is to
 give users an abstract view over an filesystem like structure so that content
 generator and content consumer do no longer have to make assumptions about
 where to store the generated content.
 .
 The repositories described here should not be used to store other things than
 BLOBs.
