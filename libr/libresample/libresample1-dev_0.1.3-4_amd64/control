Description: real-time audio resampling library - development files
 A real-time library for audio sampling rate conversion providing
 several useful features relative to resample-1.7 on which it is based:
  - More portable (source includes autoconf script and Visual C++
    project file, packaging adds CMake script with shared library
    support).
  - Memory-based (no need to read or write external files).
  - Floating-point computations (not fixed-point).
  - Faster and more accurate results (filter table increased by a factor
    of 32).
  - Supports variable resampling ratio (data can be processed in small
    chunks).
  - Easily applied to any number of simultaneous data channels
  - LGPL-licensed (libsamplerate, a GPL-licensed alternative, is
    considered by the libresample author to be technically superior).
 .
 This package contains the development headers and static libraries for
 resample.
