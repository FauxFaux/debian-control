Description: Libretro wrapper for the Beetle PCE FAST core
 This wrapper makes Beetle PCE FAST core API compatible with libretro, thus
 allowing its use with libretro frontends, such as RetroArch.
 .
 This core emulates the TurboGrafx-16 Entertainment SuperSystem, originally
 known in Japan as the PC Engine. It also emulates the TurboGrafx-CD (CD-ROMÂ²).
 .
 Beetle PCE FAST is based in the Mednafen "pce_fast" module, so it has some
 tricks to speed up the hardware emulation, but with some loss in accuracy.
