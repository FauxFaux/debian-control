Description: Perl module to enable returning from a nested call stack
 Return::MultiLevel provides a way to return immediately from a deeply
 nested call stack. This is similar to exceptions, but exceptions don't
 stop automatically at a target frame (and they can be caught by
 intermediate stack frames). In other words, this is more like
 setjmp(3)/longjmp(3) than die.
