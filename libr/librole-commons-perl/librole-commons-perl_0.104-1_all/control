Description: roles that can be commonly used, for the mutual benefit of all
 Role::Commons is not yet another implementation of roles. It is a
 collection of generic, reusable roles that hopefully you will love to
 apply to your classes. These roles are built using Moo::Role, so
 automatically integrate into the Moose object system if you're using
 it, but they do not require Moose.
 .
 This package also provides the modules Object::AUTHORITY, Object::Tap
 and Authority::shared.
