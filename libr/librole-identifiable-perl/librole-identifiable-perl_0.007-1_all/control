Description: Moose roles to identify things
 The Role::Identifiable distribution provides several Moose roles for
 identifying things.
 .
 This distribution provides the following roles:
  * Role::Identifiable::HasIdent - Adds a required ident attribute that
    stores a simple string, meant to identify exceptions.
  * Role::Identifiable::HasTags - Adds the ability for your class and its
    composed parts (roles, superclasses) as well as instances of it to
    contribute to a pool of tags describing each instance.
