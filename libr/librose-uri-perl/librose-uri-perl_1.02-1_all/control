Description: module for an easy  manipulation of URI components
 Rose::URI perl module is an alternative to URI with more
 functionalities like:
  * a rich set of query string manipulation methods
  * query parameters with multiple values
  * usage of Apache's C-based URI parsing and HTML escaping functions
    when run in a mod_perl 1.x web server environment.
 .
 Rose::URI stores each URI "in pieces" (scheme, host, path, etc.) and
 then assembles those pieces when the entire URI is needed as a
 string. This technique is based on the assumption that the URI will be
 manipulated many more times than it is stringified. If this is not the
 case in your usage scenario, then URI may be a better alternative.
 .
 Rose::URI actually uses the URI class to do the heavy lifting of
 parsing URIs when not running in a mod_perl 1.x environment.
