Description: C++ library for computational biology (development)
 This library was developed by the Rost Lab.  The lab's research is
 driven by a conviction that protein and DNA sequences encode a
 significant core of information about the ultimate structure and
 function of genetic material and its gene products.
 .
 The library provides the following facilities:
  * current working directory resource
  * exception with stack backtrace
  * file lock resource
  * passwd and group structures for C++
  * effective uid and gid resource
  * rostlab::bio::seq class with stream input operator for FASTA format
  * umask resource
 .
 This package contains files necessary for developing applications with
 librostlab.
