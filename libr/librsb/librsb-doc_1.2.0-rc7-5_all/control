Description: recursive sparse blocks matrix computations library (documentation)
 This is a library for sparse matrix computations featuring the Recursive
 Sparse Blocks (RSB) matrix format. This format allows cache efficient and
 multi-threaded (that is, shared memory parallel) operations on large
 sparse matrices.  It provides the most common operations necessary to
 iterative solvers, like matrix-vector multiplication, triangular solution,
 rows/columns scaling, diagonal extraction / setting, blocks extraction,
 norm computation, formats conversion.  The RSB format is especially well
 suited for symmetric and transposed multiplication variants.
