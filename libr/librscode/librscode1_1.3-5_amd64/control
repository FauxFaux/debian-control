Description: library implementing a Reed-Solomon error correction algorithm
 The RSCODE project is an implementation of a Reed-Solomon error correction
 algorithm. It provides a byte-sized block coding which is convenient for
 adding protection to data which is stored as eight-bit bytes (i.e., most
 common computer data).
 .
 The Reed-Solomon code is the same one used for encoding of data on Audio CD's
 and CD-ROM disks, as well as many magnetic and optical disk controllers. You
 basically want to use Reed-Solomon coding in any situation where "forward
 error correction" is needed, i.e., the decoder will not have the option of
 requesting retransmission of bad blocks.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
