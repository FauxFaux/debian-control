Description: module for creating RTF files
 RTF::Writer is for generating documents in Rich Text Format.
 .
 This module is a class; an object belonging to this class acts like
 an output filehandle, and calling methods on it causes RTF text to
 be written.
 .
 Incidentally, this module also optionally exports a few functions, particularly
 related to length.
 .
 The following documentation assumes some familiarity with the RTF
 Specification.  Users not already intimately familiar with RTF should
 look at RTF::Cookbook and/or the book "RTF Pocket Guide" from O'Reilly.
