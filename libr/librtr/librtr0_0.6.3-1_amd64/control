Description: Small extensible RPKI-RTR-Client C library
 RTRlib is an open-source C implementation of the  RPKI/Router Protocol
 client. The library allows one to fetch and store validated prefix origin data
 from a RTR-cache and performs origin verification of prefixes. It supports
 different types of transport sessions (e.g., SSH, unprotected TCP) and is
 easily extendable.
