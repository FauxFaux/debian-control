Description: Offers run-parts' functionality in Perl
 run-parts and hence Run::Parts runs all the executable files named
 within constraints described below, found in the given directory.
 Other files and directories are silently ignored.
 .
 Additionally they can just print the names of the all matching files
 (not limited to executables, but ignores blacklisted files like
 e.g. backup files), but don't actually run them.
 .
 Run::Parts contains two backend implementation. Run::Parts::Debian
 actually uses /bin/run-parts and Run::Parts::Perl is a pure Perl
 implementation of a basic set of run-parts' functionality.
 .
 On Debian Run::Parts uses Run::Parts::Debian by default. But you can
 also choose any of the backends explicitly.
