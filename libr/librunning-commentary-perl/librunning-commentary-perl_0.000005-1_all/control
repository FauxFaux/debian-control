Description: Perl module to call system() with tracking messages
 Running::Commentary provides a single subroutine: run() which is
 designed to be a more informative and less error-prone replacement for
 the built-in system(). run() acts like system(), except that it returns
 true on success and false on failure, and it announces what it's doing.
 .
 It also provides a compile-time keyword: run_with with which you can set
 lexically scoped default options for run().
