Description: SAMBox PDF processor
 SAMBox is an Apache PDFBox 2.0.0 fork intended to be used as PDF processor for
 Sejda and PDFsam related projects. The main differences between PDFBox and
 SAMBox are:
  * Lazy loading/parsing of PDF objects
  * Multiple I/O implementations to read from
  * Minimized garbage collection through the use of a pool of
    java.lang.Stringbuilder
  * PDF streams are read directly from the underlying source through the
    concept of bounded views
  * Removal of unused PDFBox features like preflight validator, fdf and digital
    signature
  * Documents can be saved using objects stream to store PDF objects
