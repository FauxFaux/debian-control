Description: SASS for Python 3: a straightforward binding of libsass for Python
 This package provides a simple Python 3 extension module sass which is binding
 Libsass (written in C/C++ by Hampton Catlin and Aaron Leung). It's very
 straightforward and there isn't any headache related Python
 distribution/deployment.
 That means you can add just libsass into your setup.py's install_requires list
 or requirements.txt file. Need no Ruby nor Node.js.
