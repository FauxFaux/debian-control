Description: modules providing common scalar and list utility subroutines
 List::Util is a collection of Perl modules that provide subroutines useful
 for working with scalars and lists, which people have expressed would be nice
 to have as a perl builtin, but where usage would not be sufficient to warrant
 use of a keyword, and the size so small such that being individual extensions
 would be wasteful.
