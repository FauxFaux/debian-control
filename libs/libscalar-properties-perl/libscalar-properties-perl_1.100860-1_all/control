Description: perl module to add run-time properties on scalar variables
 Scalar::Properties attempts to make Perl more object-oriented by
 taking an idea from Ruby: Everything you manipulate is an object,
 and the results of those manipulations are objects themselves.
 .
 'hello world'->length
 (-1234)->abs
 "oh my god, it's full of properties"->index('g')
 .
 The first example asks a string to calculate its length. The second
 example asks a number to calculate its absolute value. And the
 third example asks a string to find the index of the letter 'g'.
 .
 Using this module you can have run-time properties on initialized
 scalar variables and literal values. The word 'properties' is used
 in the Perl 6 sense: out-of-band data, little sticky notes that
 are attached to the value. While attributes (as in Perl 5's attribute
 pragma, and see the Attribute::* family of modules) are handled
 at compile-time, properties are handled at run-time.
