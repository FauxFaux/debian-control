Description: Perl module concerning the string aspects of scalars
 Scalar::String is about the string part of plain Perl scalars. A scalar has a
 string value, which is notionally a sequence of Unicode codepoints, but may
 be internally encoded in either ISO-8859-1 or UTF-8. In places, and more so
 in older versions of Perl, the internal encoding shows through. To fully
 understand Perl strings it is necessary to understand these implementation
 details.
 .
 This module provides functions to classify a string by encoding and to encode
 a string in a desired way.
