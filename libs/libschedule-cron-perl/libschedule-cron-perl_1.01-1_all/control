Description: simple but complete cron like scheduler
 This perl module can be used for periodically executing perl
 subroutines. The dates and parameters for the subroutines to be
 called are specified with a format known as crontab entry (see
 manpage crontab(5) or documentation of Schedule::Cron).
 .
 The philosophy behind Schedule::Cron is to call subroutines
 periodically from within one single Perl program instead of letting
 cron trigger several (possibly different) Perl scripts. Everything
 under one roof. Furthermore Schedule::Cron provides mechanism to
 create crontab entries dynamically, which isn't that easy with cron.
