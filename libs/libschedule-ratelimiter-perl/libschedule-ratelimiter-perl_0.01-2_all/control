Description: Perl library to prevent events from happening too quickly
 Schedule::RateLimiter provides a way to voluntarily restrict how many times a
 given action may take place within a specified time frame. Such a tool may be
 useful if you have written something which periodically polls some public
 resource and want to ensure that you do not overburden that resource with too
 many requests.
 .
 Initially, one might think that solving this problem would be as simple as
 sleeping for the number of seconds divided by the number of iterations in
 between each event. However, that would only be correct if the event took no
 time at all.
 .
 If you know exactly how much time each event is going to take then you could
 build an even more complicated one-liner such as this:
 .
 sleep( (seconds / iterations) - single_event_time )
