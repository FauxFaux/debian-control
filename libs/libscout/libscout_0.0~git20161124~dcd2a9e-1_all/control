Description: Third-party libraries detector for Android apps
 LibScout is a light-weight and effective static analysis tool to detect
 third-party libraries in Android apps. The detection is resilient against
 common bytecode obfuscation techniques such as identifier renaming or
 code-based obfuscations such as reflection-based API hiding or control-flow
 randomization.
 .
 LibScout requires the original library SDKs (compiled .jar/.aar files) to
 extract library profiles that can be used for detection on Android apps.
 .
 Unique features:
 .
   * Library detection resilient against many kinds of bytecode obfuscation.
   * Capability of pinpointing the exact library version (in some cases to a set
     of 2-3 candidate versions).
   * Capability of handling dead-code elimination, by computing a similarity
     score against baseline SDKs.
