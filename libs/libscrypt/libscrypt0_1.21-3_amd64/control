Description: scrypt shared library
 The scrypt algorithm is a password-based key derivation function
 designed to require large amounts of memory. This proof-of-work scheme
 is intended to make it costly to perform large-scale hardware
 attacks.
 .
 This package contains a shared library implementing the scrypt
 algorithm, based on the original implementation with a number of
 harnesses and simplified interfaces.
