Description: Console that can be added to any SDL application, development files
 This library provides a console similar to the consoles in Quake and other
 games but with lots of added features.
 .
 A console is meant to be a very simple way of interacting with a program
 and executing commands. Commands are linked to the console with callback
 functions so that when a command is typed in, a specific function is
 executed automatically.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static library needed to
 compile applications that use libsdl-console.
