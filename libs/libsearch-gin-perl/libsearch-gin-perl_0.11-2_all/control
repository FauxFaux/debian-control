Description: Perl module for Generalized Inverted Indexing
 Search::GIN is a Perl module providing an implementaiton of a Generalized
 Inverted Index. An inverted index is a structure storing pairs of keys and
 posting lists, where a posting list is a set of documents in which the key
 occurs. It is generalized in the sense that it does not know what operation
 it accelerates and in general is used to provide fast and scalable full-text
 search facilities.
