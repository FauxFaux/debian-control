Description: Perl module to parse URI query strings into a data structure
 Search::QueryParser parses URI query strings into a data structure to be
 handled by external search engines.
 .
 The query string can contain simple terms, "exact phrases", field names and
 comparison operators, '+/-' prefixes, parentheses, and boolean connectors.
 .
 The parser can be parameterized by regular expressions for specific notions
 of "term", "field name" or "operator" ; see the new method. The parser has no
 support for lemmatization or other term transformations : these should be
 done externally, before passing the query data structure to the search
 engine.
