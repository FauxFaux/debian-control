 Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number
 of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory
 access controls to Linux. The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains
 new architectural components originally developed to improve the security
 of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide
 general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
 control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement,
 Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.
