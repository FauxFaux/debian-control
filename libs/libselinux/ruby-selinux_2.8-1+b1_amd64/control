Description: Ruby bindings to SELinux shared libraries
 This package provides the Ruby bindings needed for developing Ruby
 SELinux applications.  Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the
 Linux kernel and a number of utilities with enhanced security
 functionality designed to add mandatory access controls to Linux.
 The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new architectural
 components originally developed to improve the security of the Flask
 operating system. These architectural components provide general
 support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access control
 policies, including those based on the concepts of Type Enforcement,
 Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.
