Description: C++ htslib/bwa-mem/fermi interface for interrogating sequence data
 C++ API and command line tool that provides a rapid and user-friendly
 interface to BAM/SAM/CRAM files, global sequence alignment operations
 and sequence assembly. Four C libraries perform core operations in
 SeqLib: HTSlib for BAM access, BWA-MEM and BLAT for sequence alignment
 and Fermi for error correction and sequence assembly. Benchmarking
 indicates that SeqLib has lower CPU and memory requirements than leading
 C++ sequence analysis APIs. Minimal SeqLib code can extract, error-correct
 and assemble reads from a CRAM file and then align with BWA-MEM.
 SeqLib also provides additional capabilities, including chromosome-aware
 interval queries and read plotting. Command line tools are available for
 performing integrated error correction, micro-assemblies and alignment.
