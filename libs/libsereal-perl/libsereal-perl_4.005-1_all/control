Description: fast, compact, powerful binary (de-)serialization module wrapper
 Sereal is an efficient, compact-output, binary and feature-rich serialization
 protocol. The Perl encoder is implemented as the Sereal::Encoder module, the
 Perl decoder correspondingly as Sereal::Decoder. They are distributed
 separately, in Debian as libsereal-decoder-perl and libsereal-encoder-perl.
 .
 This Sereal module is a very thin wrapper around both Sereal::Encoder and
 Sereal::Decoder. It depends on both and loads both. So if you have a user of
 both encoder and decoder, it is enough to depend on a particular version of
 Sereal and you'll get the most recent released versions of Sereal::Encoder
 and Sereal::Decoder.
