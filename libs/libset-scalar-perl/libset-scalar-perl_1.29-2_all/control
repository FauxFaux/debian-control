Description: Perl interface for operations on finite sets
 Set::Scalar provides an interface for working with finite, unordered sets of
 elements: creating, modifying, displaying, comparing and deriving them; the
 computation of power sets and the cartesian product of sets. It also provides
 overloaded operators for most operations.
