Description: module for simple sets of strings
 Set::Tiny is a thin wrapper around regular Perl hashes to perform often
 needed set operations, such as testing two sets of strings for equality, or
 checking whether one is contained within the other.
 .
 For a more complete implementation of mathematical set theory, see
 Set::Scalar. For sets of arbitrary objects, see Set::Object.
