Description: SHARYANTO's temporary modules for various routines
 SHARYANTO::Utils is a heterogenous collection of modules that will eventually
 have their own proper distributions, but do not yet because they are not ready
 for some reason or another. For example: alpha quality code, code not yet
 properly refactored, there are still no tests and/or documentation.
