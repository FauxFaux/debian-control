Description: POSIX Shell's "select" loop for Perl
 Shell::POSIX::Select implements the select loop of the "POSIX" shells (Bash,
 Korn, and derivatives) for Perl. That loop is unique in two ways: it's by far
 the friendliest feature of any UNIX shell, and it's the only UNIX shell loop
 that's missing from the Perl language. Until now!
 .
 What's so great about this loop? It automates the generation of a numbered
 menu of choices, prompts for a choice, proofreads that choice and complains if
 it's invalid (at least in this enhanced implementation), and executes a
 code-block with a variable set to the chosen value. That saves a lot of coding
 for interactive programs -- especially if the menu consists of many values!
 .
 The benefit of bringing this loop to Perl is that it obviates the need for
 future programmers to reinvent the Choose-From-A-Menu wheel.
