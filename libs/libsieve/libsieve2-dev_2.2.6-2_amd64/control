Description: library for parsing, sorting and filtering your mail
 This code is a standalone library based upon code which had been distributed
 with the Cyrus Mail Server. Currently libSieve implements two APIs:
 one that is based upon, and compatible with, the Sieve API as built into
 the Cyrus Mail Server, as well as a new API which is very well suited to
 be incorporated into other programs and is reasonably extensible.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
