Description: Provide access to (SM)BIOS information - development files
 libsmbios aims towards providing access to as much BIOS information as
 possible. It does this by providing a library of functions that can be
 used as well as sample binaries.
 .
 It incorporates extensible access to SMBIOS information capabilities and
 ability to perform unit tests across multiple systems without using physical
 hardware. Moreover, centralized, data-driven exception handling for broken
 BIOS tables is provided.
 .
 To start out with, the focus is on the SMBIOS tables. Currently, full access
 to the SMBIOS table and its items is implemented. In the future, it will
 provide $PIR, MPTABLE, RCI, RBU, and other tables as well.
 .
 Additionally, access and manipulation of Dell Indexed IO Token (type 0xD4)
 is implemented. This token is a vendor-extention SMBIOS structure which
 allows uniform access to manipulate the system CMOS to enable, disable, or
 otherwise manipulate normal BIOS functions or features.
