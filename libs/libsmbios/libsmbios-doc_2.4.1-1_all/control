Description: Access to (SM)BIOS information in an OS-indepent way (docs)
 libsmbios aims towards providing access to as much BIOS information as
 possible. It does this by providing a library of functions that can be used
 as well as sample binaries.
 .
 It incorporates extensible access to SMBIOS information capabilities and
 ability to perform unit tests across multiple systems without using physical
 hardware. Moreover, centralized, data-driven exception handling for broken
 BIOS tables is provided. Currently, full access to the SMBIOS table and its
 items is implemented. Additionally, access and manipulation of Dell Indexed
 IO Token (type 0xD4) is implemented. This token is a vendor-extension
 SMBIOS structure which allows uniform access to manipulate the system CMOS
 to enable, disable, or otherwise manipulate normal BIOS functions or features.
