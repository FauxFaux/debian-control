Description: library to access SMI MIB information
 The purpose of libsmi is to
   * give network management applications a concise programmer-friendly
     interface to access MIB module information,
   * separate the knowledge on SMI from the main parts of management
     applications,
   * allow one to add new kinds of MIB repositories without the need to
     adapt applications that make use of libsmi.
 .
 In this context, MIB is "Management Information Base" and SMI stands for
 "Structure and identification of Management Information". See RFC1902 and
 others for details.
 .
 This package contains the main libsmi library.
