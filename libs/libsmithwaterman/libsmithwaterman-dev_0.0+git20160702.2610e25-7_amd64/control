Description: determine similar regions between two strings or genomic sequences (devel)
 The Smith–Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment; that is,
 for determining similar regions between two strings or nucleotide or
 protein sequences. Instead of looking at the total sequence, the
 Smith–Waterman algorithm compares segments of all possible lengths and
 optimizes the similarity measure.
 .
 This is the development package containing the statically linked
 library and the header files.
