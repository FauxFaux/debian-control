Description: determine similar regions between two strings or genomic sequences
 The Smith–Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment; that is,
 for determining similar regions between two strings or nucleotide or
 protein sequences. Instead of looking at the total sequence, the
 Smith–Waterman algorithm compares segments of all possible lengths and
 optimizes the similarity measure.
