Description: driver-based API for sending SMS messages
 The SMS::Send perl module is intended to provide a driver-based single API for
 sending SMS and MMS messages. The intent is to provide a single API against
 which to write the code to send an SMS message.
 .
 At the same time, the intent is to remove the limits of some of the
 previous attempts at this sort of API, like "must be free internet-based
 SMS services".
 .
 SMS::Send drivers are installed separately, and might use the web,
 email or physical SMS hardware. It could be a free or paid. The details
 shouldn't matter.
 .
 You should not have to care how it is actually sent, only that it has
 been sent (although some drivers may not be able to provide certainty).
