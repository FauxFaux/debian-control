Description: Object Oriented Perl5 Interface to Network devices and MIBs through SNMP
 SNMP::Info gives an object oriented interface to information obtained
 through SNMP.
 .
 The idea behind this module is to give a common interface to data
 from network devices, leaving the device-specific hacks behind the
 scenes in subclasses.
 .
 The interface avoids use of OIDs in favour of methods representing
 leaf names, either for single values or tables represented as Perl
 hashes.
 .
 Information is grouped more logically than in the MIB trees. Adding
 support for new devices is easy, and takes little or no SNMP
 knowledge.
