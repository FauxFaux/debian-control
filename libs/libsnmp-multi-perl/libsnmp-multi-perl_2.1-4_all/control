Description: Perform SNMP operations on multiple hosts simultaneously
 The SNMP::Multi package provides a mechanism to perform SNMP operations
 on several hosts simultaneously.  SNMP::Multi builds on G. Marzot's SNMP
 Perl interface to the UC-Davis SNMP libraries, using asynchronous SNMP
 operations to send queries/sets to multiple hosts simultaneously.
 .
 Results from all hosts are compiled into a single object, which offers
 methods to access the data in aggregate, or broken down by host or the
 individual request.
 .
 SNMP::Multi supports SNMP GET, SET, GETNEXT, GETBULK and BULKWALK requests.
 It also performs PDU packing in order to improve network efficiency, when
 packing is possible.
