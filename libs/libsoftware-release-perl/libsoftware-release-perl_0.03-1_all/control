Description: Perl class representing a release of software
 Software::Release is a purely informational collection of objects that you
 can use to represent a release of software. Its original use-case was to
 provide a contract between a git log parser and a formatter class that
 outputs a changelog, but it may be useful to others to create bug trackers,
 dashboards or whathaveyour.
