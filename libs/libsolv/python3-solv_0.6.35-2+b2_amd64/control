Description: dependency solver using a satisfiability algorithm (Python3 bindings)
 This dependency solver code in this package is based on two major, but
 independent, blocks:
 .
 1. Using a dictionary approach to store and retrieve package
    and dependency information.
 2. Using satisfiability, a well known and researched topic, for
    resolving package dependencies.
 .
 This package contains the Python (v3) bindings for the libsolv0 library.
