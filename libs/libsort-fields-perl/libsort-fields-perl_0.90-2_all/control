Description: Sort lines containing delimited fields
 Sort::Fields provides a general purpose technique for efficiently sorting
 lists of lines that contain data separated into fields.
 .
 Sort::Fields automatically imports two subroutines, fieldsort and
 make_fieldsort, and two variants, stable_fieldsort and
 make_stable_fieldsort.  make_fieldsort generates a sorting subroutine
 and returns a reference to it.  fieldsort is a wrapper for
 the make_fieldsort subroutine.
 .
 The first argument to make_fieldsort is a delimiter string, which is
 used as a regular expression argument for a split operator.  The
 delimiter string is optional.  If it is not supplied, make_fieldsort
 splits each line using /\s+/.
