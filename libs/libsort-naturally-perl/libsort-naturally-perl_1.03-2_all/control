Description: Sort naturally - sort lexically except for numerical parts
 Sort::Naturally exports two functions, nsort and ncmp; they are used
 in implementing the idea of "natural sorting" algorithm.  With that natural
 sorting, numeric substrings are compared numerically, and other
 word-characters are compared lexically.
