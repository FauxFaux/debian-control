Description: GObject introspection data for the libsoup HTTP library
 This package contains introspection data for the libsoup HTTP library.
 .
 libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+
 applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
 on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
 the GTK+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
 supported for those who want it).
 .
 It can be used by packages using the GIRepository format to generate
 dynamic bindings.
