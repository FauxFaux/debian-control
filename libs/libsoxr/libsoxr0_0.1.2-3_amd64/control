Description: High quality 1D sample-rate conversion library
 The SoX Resampler library `libsoxr' performs one-dimensional sample-rate
 conversion - it may be used, for example, to resample PCM-encoded audio.
 .
 It aims to give fast and high quality results for any constant (rational or
 irrational) resampling ratio. Phase-response, preserved bandwidth, aliasing,
 and rejection level parameters are all configurable; alternatively, simple
 `preset' configurations may be selected.
 .
 A simple API is provided that allows interfacing using commonly-used sample
 formats and buffering schemes.
