Description: library for ambisonic encoding and decoding (runtime files)
 libspatialaudio is an open-source and cross-platform C++ library for Ambisonic
 encoding and decoding, filtering and binaural rendering. It is targeted to
 render High-Order Ambisonic (HOA) and VR/3D audio samples in multiple
 environments, from headphones to classic loudspeakers. Its binaural rendering
 can be used for classical 5.1/7.1 spatial channels as well as Ambisonics
 inputs.  It supports Higher Order Ambisonics (HOA) and ACN/SN3D Ambisonics
 audio streams following the Google spatial audio specification and the IETF
 codec Ambisonics specification.
 .
 The library allows you to encode, decode, rotate, zoom HOA Ambisonics audio
 streams up to the 3rd order. It can output to standard and custom loudspeakers
 arrays. To playback with headphones, the binauralizer applies an HRTF (either
 a SOFA file or the included MIT HRTF) to provide a spatial binaural rendering
 effect. The binauralization can also be used to render multichannels streams
 (5.1, 7.1...).
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
