Description: reader for OpenOffice 1.x spreadsheet data
 Spreadsheet::ReadSXC extracts data from OpenOffice 1.x spreadsheet files
 (.sxc). It exports the function read_sxc() which takes a filename and an
 optional reference to a hash of options as arguments and returns a
 reference to a hash of references to two-dimensional arrays. The hash keys
 correspond to the names of worksheets in the OpenOffice workbook. The
 two-dimensional arrays correspond to rows and cells in the respective
 spreadsheets.
