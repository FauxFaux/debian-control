Description: simple spreadsheet worker
 Spreadsheet::Wright is a fork of Spreadsheet::Write and may be used as
 a drop-in replacement.
 .
 Spreadsheet::Wright writes files in CSV, Microsoft Excel, HTML and
 OpenDocument formats.  It is especially suitable for building various
 dumps and reports where rows are built in sequence, one after another.
 .
 It is not especially suitable for modifying existing files.
 .
 The name is a not just pun on "write" - the word "wright" means worker
 or crafter, and "Spreadsheet::Wright" does a lot of the work of
 spreadsheet output for you!
