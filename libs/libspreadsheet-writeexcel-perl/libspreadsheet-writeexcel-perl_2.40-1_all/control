Description: module to create Excel spreadsheets
 Spreadsheet::WriteExcel is a Perl module that can be used to create a cross-
 platform Excel binary file. Multiple worksheets can be added to a workbook
 and formatting can be applied to cells. Additionally, this module supports
 writing text, numeric values, formulas and hyperlinks to cells.
 .
 The Excel file produced by this module is compatible with Excel 5, 95, 97
 and 2000. Generated files are also compatible with the Linux/UNIX spreadsheet
 applications OpenOffice.org, Gnumeric and XESS. The generated files are not
 compatible with MS Access.
 .
 This module cannot be used to read an Excel file. See Spreadsheet::ParseExcel
 (libspreadsheet-parseexcel-perl) or look at the main documentation for some
 suggestions. This module cannot be used to write to an existing Excel file.
