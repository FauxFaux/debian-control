Description: module for parsing and processing SQL statements
 SQL::Statement is a Perl module that implements a small, abstract SQL engine.
 This module is not useful itself, but as a base class for deriving concrete
 SQL engines. The implementation is designed to work fine with the DBI driver
 DBD::CSV, thus probably not so well suited for a larger environment, but I'd
 hope it is extendable without too much problems.
