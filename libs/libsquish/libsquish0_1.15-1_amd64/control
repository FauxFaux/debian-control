Description: DXT texture compression library
 libsquish is a lossy software DXT texture compression library. It
 implements the 3 useful DXT flavours (1,3,5) and has SIMD support for
 x86 (SSE) and powerpc (Altivec). It can be used (as a much slower
 software fallback) instead of the hardware implementations present on
 most modern graphics chips.
 .
 This package is the library itself.
