Description: Smith-Waterman aligner based on libssw
 This package provides a command-line aligner based on the libssw library,
 a fast SIMD accelerated implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm.
 The input files can be in FASTA or FASTQ format. Both target and query files
 can contain multiple sequences. Each sequence in the query file will be
 aligned with all sequences in the target file. Output is provided in SAM or
 BLAST-like text format.
