Description: Perl module for basic descriptive statistical functions
 Statistics::Descriptive provides basic functions used in descriptive
 statistics. It has an object oriented design and supports two
 different types of data storage and calculation objects: sparse and
 full. With the sparse method, none of the data is stored and only a
 few statistical measures are available. Using the full method, the
 entire data set is retained and additional functions are available.
