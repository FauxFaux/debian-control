Description: Perl module for simple statistical analysis
 Statistics::Lite is a lightweight, functional alternative to larger, more
 complete, object-oriented statistics packages. As such, it is likely to be
 better suited, in general, to smaller data sets.
 .
 When you just want something to give some very basic, high-school-level
 statistical values, without having to set up and populate an object first,
 this module may be useful.
