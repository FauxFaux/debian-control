Description: module to perform a Random Walk statistical test
 Statistics::Test::RandomWalk implements a Random Walk test of a random number
 generator as outlined in Blobel et al. Basically, it tests that the numbers
 (in the interval between 0 and 1) generated by a random number generator are
 distributed evenly. It divides [0,1] into n evenly sized bins and calculates
 the number of expected and actual random numbers in the bin. (In fact, this
 counts the cumulated numbers, but that works the same.)
