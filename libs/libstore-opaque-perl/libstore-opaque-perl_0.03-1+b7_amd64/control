Description: module for opaque objects to prevent accidental leaking
 Store::Opaque implements an opaque object implementation to avoid
 accidentially putting sensitive information into dumps or stack traces.
 .
 This module is not directly about security in the sense of preventing
 malicious action. It's about preventing mistakes that could turn out to be a
 security or compliance issue.
