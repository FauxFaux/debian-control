  - Erasure encoding with reed solomon for data durability
  - Robust handling of shard transfers by selecting alternative sources
  - File integrity and authenticity verified with HMAC-SHA512
  - File encryption with AES-256-CTR
  - File name and bucket name encryption with AES -256 -GCM
  - Proxy support with SOCKS5, SOCKS4, SOCKS4a
