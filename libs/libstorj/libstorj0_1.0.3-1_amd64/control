Description: Asynchronous C library for file transfer on the Storj network
 Asynchronous multi-platform C library for encrypted file transfer on  the Storj
 network.
 libstorj provides the following features:
  - Asynchronous I/O with concurrent peer-to-peer network requests for shards
  - Erasure encoding with reed solomon for data durability
  - Robust handling of shard transfers by selecting alternative sources
  - File integrity and authenticity verified with HMAC-SHA512
  - File encryption with AES-256-CTR
  - File name and bucket name encryption with AES-256-GCM
  - Proxy support with SOCKS5, SOCKS4, SOCKS4a
  - Asynchronous progress updates in bytes per file
  - Transfers can be cleanly canceled per file
  - Seed based file encryption key for portability between devices
  - Reference implementation for SIP5 file standard
