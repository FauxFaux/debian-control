Description: temporary buffer to store strings in a seekable filehandle
 Stream::Buffered is a buffer class to store byte strings of arbitrary length
 and then get a seekable filehandle once everything is buffered. It uses PerlIO
 and/or a temporary file to save the buffer depending on the amount of bytes
 stored.
