Description: Perl interface for cyclic redundancy check generation
 The String::CRC32 module calculates CRC sums of 32 bit lengths.
 It generates the same CRC values as ZMODEM, PKZIP, PICCHECK and
 many others.
 .
 Despite its name, this module is able to compute the checksum of
 strings as well as of files.
