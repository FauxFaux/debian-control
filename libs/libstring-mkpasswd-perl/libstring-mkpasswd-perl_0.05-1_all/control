Description: Perl module implementing a random password generator
 String::MkPasswd defines a single function, mkpasswd(), to generate
 random passwords.  The function is meant to be a simple way for
 developers and system administrators to easily generate a relatively
 secure password.
 .
 The exportable mkpasswd() function returns a single scalar: a random
 password.  By default, this password is nine characters long with a
 random distribution of four lower-case characters, two upper-case
 characters, two digits, and one non-alphanumeric character.  These
 parameters can be tuned by the user, as described in the /"ARGUMENTS"
 section.
