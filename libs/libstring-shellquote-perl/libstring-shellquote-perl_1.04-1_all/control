Description: module to quote strings for passing through the shell
 The String::ShellQuote module contains some functions which are useful for
 quoting strings which are going to pass through the shell or a shell-like
 object, plus a command-line interface to it. It is useful for doing robust
 tool programming, particularly when dealing with files whose names contain
 white space or shell globbing characters.
