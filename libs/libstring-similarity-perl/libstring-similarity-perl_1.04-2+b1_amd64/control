Description: Perl module for calculating the similarity of two strings
 String::Similarity calculates the similarity index of its two arguments.
 A value of 0 means that the strings are entirely different. A value
 of 1 means that the strings are identical. Everything else lies between
 0 and 1 and describes the amount of similarity between the strings.
