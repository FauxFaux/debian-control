Description: Perl module providing recursive diff for perl structures
 Struct::Compare compares two values of any type and structure and returns
 true if they are the same. It does a deep comparison of the structures,
 so a hash of a hash of a whatever will be compared correctly.
 .
 This is especially useful for writing unit tests for your modules!
