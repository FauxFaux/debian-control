Description: Documentation for STXXL
 STXXL provides an STL replacement using an abstraction layer to
 storage devices to allow for the optimal layout of data structures. This
 allows for multi-terabyte datasets to be held and manipulated in standard
 C++ data structures, whilst abstracting the complexity of managing this
 behaviour efficiently. STXXL utilises multi-disk I/O to speed up
 I/O bound calculations. STXXL has been developed at the University
 of Karlsruhe.
