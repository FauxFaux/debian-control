Description: sophisticated exporter for custom-built routines
 When you use a perl module, first it is "required" function used, then its
 import method is called.
 .
 Sub::Exporter provides a sophisticated alternative to Exporter.pm.  It allows
 for renaming, currying/sub-generation etc.
 .
 Sub::Exporter builds a custom exporter which can then be installed into your
 module. It builds this method based on configuration passed to its
 setup_exporter method.
