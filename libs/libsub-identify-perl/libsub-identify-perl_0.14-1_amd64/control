Description: module to retrieve names of code references
 Sub::Identify allows you to retrieve the real name of code references. For
 this, it uses perl's introspection mechanism, provided by the B module.
 .
 It provides four functions : sub_name returns the name of the
 subroutine (or __ANON__ if it's an anonymous code reference),
 stash_name returns its package, and sub_fullname returns the
 concatenation of the two.
 .
 The fourth function, get_code_info, returns a list of two elements,
 the package and the subroutine name (in case of you want both and are worried
 by the speed.)
 .
 In case of subroutine aliasing, those functions always return the
 original name.
