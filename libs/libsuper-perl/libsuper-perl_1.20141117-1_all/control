Description: control superclass method dispatch
 SUPER allows one to dispatch control to the superclass with a better syntax
 than the original mechanism. It provides an universal method super to
 determine a class' own superclass. SUPER allows the use of mixin and roles as
 the class containing the method is no more needed at compile time.
