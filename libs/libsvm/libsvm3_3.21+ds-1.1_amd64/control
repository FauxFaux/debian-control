Description: library implementing support vector machines
 The LIBSVM library is used to calculate Support Vector Machine optimizations
 with a great variety of powerful options.  It includes one-class, two-class,
 multiclass, regression-mode, and probablistic output functionality.  It is
 primarily of interest to machine-learning researchers and artificial
 intelligence application developers.
