Description: module providing access to svnlook data
 SVN::Look is a simple Perl module that provides a object-oriented wrapper
 around Subversion's svnlook command, with built-in caching to improve speed.
 It is useful to gather information about a repository, its revisions and its
 transactions, which makes it easy for hook writers to retrieve and use the
 information they need.
