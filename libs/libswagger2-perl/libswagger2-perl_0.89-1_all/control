Description: Perl module for generating, parsing and transforming swagger API documentation
 Swagger2 is a module for generating, parsing and transforming swagger API
 documentation. It has support for reading swagger specification in JSON
 notation and it can also read YAML files, if a YAML parser is installed.
 .
 It comes with a Mojolicious plugin, Mojolicious::Plugin::Swagger2, which can
 set up routes and perform input and output validation.
 .
 Upstream deprecation warning: The Swagger2 distribution is no longer actively
 maintained. Only severe bug fixes and pull requests will move this code
 forward. The reason behind this is that the code is too complex and hard to
 maintain.
