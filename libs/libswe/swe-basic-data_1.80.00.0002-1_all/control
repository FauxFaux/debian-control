Description: basic data files for the libswe package
 This package includes basic data files needed by libswe, the Swiss Ephemeris.
 The basic data consists of these files:
 /usr/share/libswe/ephe/sedeltat.txt.inactive
 /usr/share/libswe/ephe/sefstars.txt
 /usr/share/libswe/ephe/seleapsec.txt
 /usr/share/libswe/ephe/seorbel.txt
 /usr/share/libswe/ephe/fixstars.cat
 The Swiss Ephemeris library can be used without installed data,
 if the user provides that data in her own private directory
 and points to it with SE_EPHE_PATH.
