Description: extensions to the Swing GUI toolkit
 This package contains extensions to the Swing GUI toolkit, including new and
 enhanced components that provide functionality commonly required by rich
 client applications. Highlights include:
  - Sorting, filtering, highlighting for tables, trees, and lists
  - Find/search
  - Auto-completion
  - Login/authentication framework
  - TreeTable component
  - Collapsible panel component
  - Date picker component
  - Tip-of-the-Day component
 .
 Many of these features will eventually be incorporated into the Swing toolkit,
 although API compatibility will not be guaranteed. The SwingX project focuses
 exclusively on the raw components themselves.
