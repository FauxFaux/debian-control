Description: extensions to the Swing GUI toolkit, version 1
 This package contains extensions to the Swing GUI toolkit, including new and
 enhanced components that provide functionality commonly required by rich
 client applications. Highlights include:
  - Sorting, filtering, highlighting for tables, trees, and lists
  - Find/search
  - Auto-completion
  - Login/authentication framework
  - TreeTable component
  - Collapsible panel component
  - Date picker component
  - Tip-of-the-Day component
 .
 Many of these features will eventually be incorporated into the Swing toolkit,
 although API compatibility will not be guaranteed. The SwingX project focuses
 exclusively on the raw components themselves.
