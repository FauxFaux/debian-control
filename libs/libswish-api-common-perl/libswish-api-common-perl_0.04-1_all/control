Description: Perl interface to the SWISH index engine
 SWISH::API::Common offers an easy interface to the Swish index engine. While
 SWISH::API offers a complete API, SWISH::API::Common focuses on ease of use.
 Currently, this API allows for indexing documents in a single directory and
 any of its subdirectories. However, index() and search() cannot be executed
 in parallel.
