Description: Highlighting of Perl Syntactical Structures
 Syntax::Highlight::Perl::Improved provides syntax highlighting for
 Perl code. The design bias is roughly line-oriented and streamed (ie,
 processing a file line-by-line in a single pass). Provisions may be
 made in the future for tasks related to "back-tracking" (i.e.,
 re-doing a single line in the middle of a stream) such as speeding up
 state copying.
