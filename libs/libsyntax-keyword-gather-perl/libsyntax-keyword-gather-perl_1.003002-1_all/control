Description: syntax extension for the "gather" keyword
 Syntax::Keyword::Gather is a Perl syntax extension (see libsyntax-perl)
 that provides the "gather" control structure, which was inspired by Perl 6.
 It allows lists to be constructed procedurally, without the need for a
 temporary variable, by managing an implicit array within a closure.
