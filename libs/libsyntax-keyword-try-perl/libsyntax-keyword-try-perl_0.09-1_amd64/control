Description: try/catch/finally syntax for perl
 Syntax::Keyword::Try provides a syntax plugin that implements
 exception-handling semantics in a form familiar to users of other languages,
 being built on a block labeled with the try keyword, followed by at least one
 of a catch or finally block.
 .
 As well as providing a handy syntax for this useful behaviour, this module
 also serves to contain a number of code examples for how to implement parser
 plugins and manipulate optrees to provide new syntax and behaviours for perl
 code.
