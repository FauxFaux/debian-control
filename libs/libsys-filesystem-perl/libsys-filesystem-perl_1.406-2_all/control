Description: Perl module to retrieve list of filesystems and their properties
 Sys::Filesystem is intended to be a portable interface to list and query
 filesystem names and their properties. It hopes to provide a consistent API
 to list all, mounted, unmounted and special filesystems on a system, and
 query as many properties as possible with common aliases wherever possible.
