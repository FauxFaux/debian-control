Description: Figure out the long (fully-qualified) hostname
 Sys::Hostname::Long determines the host full name on multiple
 operating systems (MacOS, Windows, Unix-like systems; more later.)
 .
 The Sys::Hostname class is the best and standard way to get the basic
 hostname, but that may not be fully qualified.  This module tries to
 determine the host's fully qualified name.
