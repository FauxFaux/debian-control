Description: module for typical installation tasks of system administrators
 Sysadm::Install executes shell-like commands performing typical
 installation tasks: Copying files, extracting tarballs, calling make.
 It has a fail once and die policy, meticulously checking the result
 of every operation and calling die() immeditatly if anything fails.
 .
 Sysadm::Install also supports a dry_run mode, in which it
 logs everything, but suppresses any write actions.
