Description: package to obtain basic system information
 System::Info tries to present system-related information, like number
 of CPUs, architecture, OS, and release related information in a
 system-independent way.  This releases the user of this module of the
 need to know if the information comes from Windows, Linux, HP-UX,
 AIX, Solaris, Irix, or VMS, and if the architecture is i386, x64,
 pa-risc2, or arm.
