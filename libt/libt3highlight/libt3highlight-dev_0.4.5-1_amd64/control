Description: Development files for libt3highlight
 The libt3highlight library provides functions for syntax-highlighting different
 types of text files. Its main design goal is an easily restartable syntax
 highlighting, suitable for use in interactive text editors.
 .
 To make the syntax highlighting restartable, libt3highlight uses a single
 integer start-of-line state. However, it does provide several advanced
 features, such as dynamic end-of-state patterns, which make it possible to
 highlight complex languages like Perl and Bash with high fidelity.
 .
 This package contains the header files to compile programs against
 libt3highlight.
