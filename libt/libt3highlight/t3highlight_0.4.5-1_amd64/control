Description: Command-line syntax highligher
 The libt3highlight library provides functions for syntax-highlighting different
 types of text files. Its main design goal is an easily restartable syntax
 highlighting, suitable for use in interactive text editors.
 .
 To make the syntax highlighting restartable, libt3highlight uses a single
 integer start-of-line state. However, it does provide several advanced
 features, such as dynamic end-of-state patterns, which make it possible to
 highlight complex languages like Perl and Bash with high fidelity.
 .
 This package contains the t3highlight program, which allows applying the syntax
 highlighting capabilities of libt3highlight on the command line to produce
 for example HTML output.
