Description: module to enable taint checking at runtime
 Taint::Runtime module is intended to encourage the use of taint mode as
 painless as possible. You should probably use the -T switch on the commandline
 instead. There are a somewhat limited number of legitimate use cases where you
 should use this module instead of the -T switch. Unless you have a specific and
 good reason for not using the -T option, you should use the -T option. See
 manpage for more details.
