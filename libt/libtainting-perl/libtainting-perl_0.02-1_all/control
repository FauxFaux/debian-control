Description: Perl pragma to enable taint mode lexically
 tainting provides a simpler interface to Taint::Runtime. The idea is so that
 there is no functions or variables to import. Just use or no, like warnings
 or strict. Tainting of %ENV will be done one time automatically the first
 time this module is used.
 .
 Please (PLEASE) read Taint::Runtime's documentation first about the pro's and
 con's of enabling/disabling tainting at runtime. Use -T if you can.
