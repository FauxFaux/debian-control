Description: recommended modules for Enlightened Perl development
 Task::Kensho is a list of recommended modules for Enlightened Perl
 development. The list is maintained by the Enlightened Perl Organisation.
 .
 Perl modules that are recommended by Task::Kensho are grouped into several
 logical categories ("tasks"). Modules are chosen from various top 100
 most-used Perl modules lists and from discussions with various subject matter
 experts in the Perl Community.
 .
 This package recommends the libtask-kensho-all-perl package, which allows
 quick installation of all modules recommended in all Task::Kensho tasks.
 Note that one can install each Task::Kensho task individually if preferred.
 .
 This package also provides documentation for Task::Kensho including details
 of the recommended modules for each task.
