Description: interactive command line editing facilities
 The tecla library provides UNIX and LINUX programs with interactive
 command line editing facilities, similar to those of the UNIX tcsh
 shell. In addition to simple command-line editing, it supports recall
 of previously entered command lines, TAB completion of file names or
 other tokens, and in-line wild-card expansion of filenames. The
 internal functions which perform file-name completion and wild-card
 expansion are also available externally for optional use by programs.
 .
 In addition, the library includes a path-searching module. This allows
 an application to provide completion and lookup of files located in
 UNIX style paths. Although not built into the line editor by default,
 it can easily be called from custom tab-completion callback
 functions. This was originally conceived for completing the names of
 executables and providing a way to look up their locations in the
 user's PATH environment variable, but it can easily be asked to look
 up and complete other types of files in any list of directories.
 .
 Note that special care has been taken to allow the use of this library
 in threaded programs. The option to enable this is discussed in the
 Makefile, and specific discussions of thread safety are presented in
 the included man pages.
 .
 This package contains the runtime libraries.
