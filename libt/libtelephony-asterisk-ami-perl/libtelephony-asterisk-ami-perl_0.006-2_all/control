Description: Simple Asterisk Manager Interface client (Perl module)
 Telephony::Asterisk::AMI is a simple client for the Asterisk Manager
 Interface. It's better documented and less buggy than Asterisk::Manager, and
 has fewer prerequisites than Asterisk::AMI. It uses IO::Socket::IP, so it
 should support either IPv4 or IPv6.
 .
 If you need a more sophisticated client (especially for use in an
 event-driven program), try Asterisk::AMI.
