Description: TT2/3, HT, HTE, Tmpl, and Velocity Engine
 Template::Alloy represents the mixing of features and capabilities
 from all of the major mini-language based template systems (support
 for non-mini-language based systems will happen eventually).  With
 Template::Alloy you can use your favorite template interface and syntax
 and get features from each of the other major template systems.  And
 Template::Alloy is fast - whether your using mod_perl, cgi, or running
 from the commandline.  There is even Template::Alloy::XS for getting
 a little more speed when that is necessary.
 .
 According to Wikipedia, "an alloy is a homogeneous mixture of two or
 more elements".
