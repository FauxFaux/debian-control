Description: GD plugin(s) for the Template Toolkit
 This package provides a number of Template Toolkit plugin modules to
 interface with Lincoln Stein's GD modules. These in turn provide an
 interface to Thomas Boutell's GD graphics library.
 .
 These plugins were distributed as part of the Template Toolkit until
 version 2.15 released in February 2006. At this time they were
 extracted into this separate distribution.
