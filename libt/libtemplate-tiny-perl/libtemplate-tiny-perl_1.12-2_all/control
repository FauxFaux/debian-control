Description: lightweight implementation of Template Toolkit
 Template::Tiny is a reimplementation of a partial subset of the Template
 Toolkit, in as few lines of code as possible.
 .
 It is intended for use in light-usage, low-memory, or low-cpu templating
 situations, where you may need to upgrade to the full feature set in the
 future, or if you want the familiarity of TT-style templates.
 .
 Note: This module is experimental and subject to change without notice.
