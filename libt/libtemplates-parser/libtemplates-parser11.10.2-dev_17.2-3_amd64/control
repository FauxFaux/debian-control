Description: Ada library to parse files and replace variables
 The main goal is to ease the development of Web servers. In CGI
 (Common Gateway Interface) applications, you have to write  HTML pages in
 the program (in Ada or whatever other language) by using some specific
 libraries or by using only basic output functions.  This is of course not
 mandatory but by lack of a good library every Web development ends up doing
 just that.  Templates Parser takes that burden off of you.
 .
 This package contains the static libraries, documentation, tools and Ada
 specification files.
