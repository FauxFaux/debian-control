Description: module for editing a document via $EDITOR
 Term::EditorEdit is a tool for prompting the user to edit a piece of text via
 $VISUAL or $EDITOR and return the result.
 .
 In addition to just editing a document, this module can distinguish between a
 document preamble and document content, giving you a way to provide
 "out-of-bound" information to whoever is editing. Once an edit is complete,
 only the content (whatever was below the preamble) is returned.
