Description: simple but featureful terminal progress bar
 Progress bars are handy - they tell you how much work has been done, how
 much is left to do and estimate how long it will take. But they can be
 fiddly! Term::ProgressBar::Simple module does the right thing in almost
 all cases in a really convenient way.
