Description: Perl extension for the GNU ReadLine/History Library
 Term::ReadLine::Gnu is a Perl interface to the GNU ReadLine Library, allowing
 developers to provide features including input line editing, input history
 management, word completion and more.
 .
 Through this module, you have access to almost all variables and functions as
 documented in the GNU ReadLine/History Library. This means you can write your
 custom editing function, custom completion function, and so on, with Perl.
 You may find it useful for prototyping before programming with C.
