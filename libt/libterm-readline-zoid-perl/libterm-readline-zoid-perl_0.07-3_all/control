Description: Pure Perl implementation of Readline libraries
 Term::ReadLine::Zoid provides a set of modules that form an
 interactive input buffer written in plain perl with minimal
 dependencies.  It features almost all key-bindings described in the
 posix spec for the sh(1) utility with some extensions like multiline
 editing; this includes a vi-command mode with a save-buffer (for
 copy-pasting) and an undo-stack.
 .
 It is compatible with the Term::ReadLine interface, so it can be
 used with perl programs using this interface.
