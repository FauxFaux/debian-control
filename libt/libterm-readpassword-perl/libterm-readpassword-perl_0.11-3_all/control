Description: prompt user for a password
 Term::ReadPassword lets you ask the user for a password in the
 traditional way, from the keyboard, without echoing.
 .
 The read_password function prompts for input, reads a line of
 text from the keyboard, then returns that line to the caller.
 The line of text doesn't include the newline character, so
 there's no need to use chomp.
