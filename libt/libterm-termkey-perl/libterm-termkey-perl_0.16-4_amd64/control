Description: perl wrapper around libtermkey
 Term::TermKey provides a light perl wrapper around the libtermkey library.
 Term::TermKey attempts to provide an abstract way to read keypress events in
 terminal-based programs by providing structures that describe keys, rather
 than simply returning raw bytes as read from the TTY device.
