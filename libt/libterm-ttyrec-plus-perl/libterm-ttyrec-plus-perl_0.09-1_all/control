Description: module for reading a ttyrec
 Term::TtyRec::Plus is a module that lets you read ttyrec files. The related
 module, Term::TtyRec is designed more for simple interactions.
 .
 Term::TtyRec::Plus gives you more information and, using a callback, lets you
 munge the data block and timestamp. It will do all the subtle work of making
 sure timing is kept consistent, and of rebuilding each frame header.
