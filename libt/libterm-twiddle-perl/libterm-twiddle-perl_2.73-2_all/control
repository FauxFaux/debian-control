Description: Perl module to twiddle a thingy while-u wait
 Term::Twiddle provides methods to start, stop and configure a terminal-based
 animation meant to entertain the user while waiting for some long-running
 task to finish. It was inspired by the spinner during FreeBSD's loader
 bootstrap, and aspires to let other people find the same joy in it as the
 author did.
