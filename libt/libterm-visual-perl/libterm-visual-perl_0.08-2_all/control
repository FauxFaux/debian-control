Description: split-terminal user interface for Perl
 Term::Visual is a "visual" terminal interface for curses applications.
 It provides the split-screen interface you may have seen in console
 based IRC and MUD clients.
 .
 Term::Visual uses the POE networking and multitasking framework to support
 concurrent input from network sockets and the console, multiple
 timers, and more.
