Description: module to emulate a DEC VT102 terminal
 The Term::VT102 class provides emulation of most of the functions of a DEC
 VT102 terminal. Once initialised, data passed to a VT102 object is processed
 and the in-memory "screen" modified accordingly. This "screen" can be
 interrogated by the external program in a variety of ways.
 .
 This allows your program to interface with full-screen console programs by
 running them in a subprocess and passing their output to a VT102 class. You
 can then see what the application has written on the screen by querying the
 class appropriately.
