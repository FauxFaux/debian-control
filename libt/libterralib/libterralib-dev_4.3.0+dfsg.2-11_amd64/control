Description: C++ library for Geographical Information Systems -- development package
 TerraLib enables quick development of custom-built geographical applications
 using spatial databases. As a research tool, TerraLib  is aimed at providing a
 rich and powerful environment for the development of GIS research,
 enabling the development of GIS prototypes that include new concepts such as
 spatio-temporal data models, geographical ontologies and advanced spatial
 analysis techniques. TerraLib defines a geographical data model and provides
 support for this model over a range of different DBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL,
 ORACLE and ACCESS), and is implemented as a library of C++ classes and
 functions, written in ANSI-C++.
 .
 This package contains development files for terralib.
