Description: module for aggregating tests to make them run faster
 A common problem with many test suites is that they can take a long time to
 run. The longer they run, the less likely you are to run the tests.
 .
 Test::Aggregate borrows a trick from Apache::Registry to load up your tests
 at once, create a separate package for each test and wraps each package in a
 method named run_the_tests. This allows one to load perl only once and related
 modules only once. If you have modules which are expensive to load, this can
 dramatically speed up a test suite.
 .
 WARNING: this is ALPHA code. The interface is not guaranteed to be stable.
 Further, check out Test::Aggregate::Nested (included with this distribution).
 It's a more robust implementation which does not have the same limitations as
 Test::Aggregate.
