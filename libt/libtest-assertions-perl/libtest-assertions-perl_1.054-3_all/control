Description: simple set of building blocks for unit and runtime testing
 Test::Assertions provides a convenient set of tools for constructing tests,
 such as unit tests or run-time assertion checks (like C's ASSERT macro).
 Unlike some of the Test:: modules available on CPAN, Test::Assertions is
 not limited to unit test scripts; for example it can be used to check if
 output is as expected within a benchmarking script.
 When it is used for unit tests, it generates output in the standard form
 for CPAN unit testing (under Test::Harness).
