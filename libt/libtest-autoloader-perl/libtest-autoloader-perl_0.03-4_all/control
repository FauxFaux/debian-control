Description: testing utility for autosplit/autoloaded modules
 Test::AutoLoader single-purpose module attempts to eliminate uncaught syntax
 errors or other obvious goofs in subroutines that are autosplit, and hence not
 looked at by "perl -c Module.pm". Ideally, this module will become unnecessary
 as you reach full coverage of those subroutines in your unit tests. Until
 that happy day, however, this should provide a quick and dirty backstop for
 embarrassing typos.
