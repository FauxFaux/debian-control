Description: module for specifying tests with a finer granularity
 Test::Block allows one to specify the number of expected tests at a finer
 level of granularity than an entire test script. It is built with
 Test::Builder and plays happily with Test::More and friends.
 .
 Note: Test::Block has been marked DEPRECATED by its author. It was
 written before subtests existed in TAP and Test::More. These days
 subtests will probably be a better option for you.
