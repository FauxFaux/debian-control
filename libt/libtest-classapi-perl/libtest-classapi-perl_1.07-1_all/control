Description: Perl extension for basic first-pass API testing for class trees
 For many APIs with large numbers of classes, it can be very useful to be able
 to do a quick once-over to make sure that classes, methods, and inheritance
 is correct, before doing more comprehensive testing.
 Test::ClassAPI aims to provide such a capability.
