Description: module to check for uncleaned imports
 Test::CleanNamespaces lets you check your module's namespaces for imported
 functions you might have forgotten to remove with namespace::autoclean or
 namespace::clean and are therefore available to be called as methods, which
 usually isn't want you want.
