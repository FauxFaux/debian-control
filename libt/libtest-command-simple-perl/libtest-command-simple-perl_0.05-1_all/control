Description: Perl module to test external commands
 Test::Command::Simple is a intended to simplify testing of external commands.
 It does so by running the command under IPC::Open3, closing the stdin
 immediately, and reading everything from the command's stdout and stderr.
 It then makes the output available to be tested.
 .
 It is not (yet?) as feature-rich as Test::Cmd (in package libtest-cmd-perl),
 however the interface to this is much simpler.  Tests also plug directly
 into the Test::Builder framework, which plays nice with Test::More.
