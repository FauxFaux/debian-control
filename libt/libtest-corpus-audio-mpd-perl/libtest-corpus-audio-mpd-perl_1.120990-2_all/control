Description: module to fake mpd for testing purposes
 Test::Corpus::Audio::MPD is a Perl test harness that tries to launch a new
 Music Player Daemon (MPD) server using a fake mpd.conf file with correct
 paths for testing.
 .
 If an mpd server is already running, this module will stop it temporarily if
 the MPD_TEST_OVERRIDE environment variable is true; otherwise, the test will
 bail. Once the tests are complete, the temporarily launched mpd server will
 be shut down and the original one relaunched (if there was one).
