Description: test module to validate a META.yml file
 Test::CPAN::Meta::YAML::Perl was written to ensure that a META.yml file,
 provided with a standard distribution, meets the specifications that are
 gradually being introduced to module uploads, via the use of
 ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Build and Module::Install.
 It is one of three very similar packages with different dependencies
 and you may prefer one of the others: libtest-cpan-meta-perl or
 libtest-cpan-meta-json-perl.
