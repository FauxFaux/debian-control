Description: support for testing against multiple unspecified databases
 From the perspective of a module author, this allows you to write tests
 against a datbase without knowing precisely which databases will be used.
 You call Test::Database->handles() and you get a number of DBI handles
 against which you can run your tests. You can specify which Databases you
 are willing to support.
 .
 From the perspective of someone installing a perl module which uses
 Test::Database, you put a config file in your home directory which
 explains how to connect to non-file based databases. File based databases
 do not normally needed configuration so long as the DBD driver is available.
