Description: Test::Deep plugin for comparing lists as if they were hashes
 Test::Deep::UnorderedPairs provides the sub unordered_pairs (and tuples,
 samehash, as synonyms) to indicate the data being tested is a list of pairs
 that should be tested where the order of the pairs is insignificant.
 .
 This is useful when testing a function that returns a list of hash elements
 as an arrayref, not a hashref.
