Description: Perl module for verifying CPAN MANIFEST files
 Test::DistManifest provides a simple method of testing that a MANIFEST
 matches the distribution. It is similar to Test::CheckManifest, but differs
 in that it has native support for the MANIFEST.SKIP file.
 .
 It tests three things:
 .
  1. Everything in MANIFEST exists
  2. Everything in the package is listed in MANIFEST, or subsequently matches
     a regular expression mask in MANIFEST.SKIP
  3. Nothing exists in MANIFEST that also matches a mask in MANIFEST.SKIP,
     which is an unsatisfiable condition
 .
 Much of the functionality is provided by Module::Manifest, so developers
 wishing to manipulate MANIFEST files in a similar way are encouraged to look
 at that distribution.
