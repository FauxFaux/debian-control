Description: Perl module to test various effects at once
 Test::Effects allows one to test all effects of some code to be tested
 at once: return value, I/O, warnings, exceptions, etc.
 .
 Test::Effects provides a single exported subroutine: effects_ok.
 .
 This sub expects a block of code (or sub ref) as its first argument, followed
 by an optional hash ref as its second, and an optional string as its third.
