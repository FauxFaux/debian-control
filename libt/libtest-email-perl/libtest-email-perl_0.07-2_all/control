Description: email contents test module
 Test::Email provides tests for email contents; it is a subclass of
 MIME::Entity with header_is, body_is, or _ok or _like and part_ok,
 mime_type_ok methods. Tests for equality remove trailing newlines from
 strings before testing. Some mail messages have newlines appended to them
 during the mailing process, which could cause unnecessary confusion.
 .
 This package also provides Test::POP3 to automate email delivery tests.
