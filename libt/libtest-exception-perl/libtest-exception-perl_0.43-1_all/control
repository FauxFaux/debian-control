Description: module for testing exception-based code
 Test::Exception is a Perl test module that provides a few convenience methods
 for testing exception-based code. It is built with Test::Builder and plays
 happily with Test::More and friends.
 .
 Note that this module only checks for exceptions, so it ignores other methods
 of halting program executing - including exit(). If your code causes the Perl
 interpreter to exit, Test::Exception won't be able to catch it.
