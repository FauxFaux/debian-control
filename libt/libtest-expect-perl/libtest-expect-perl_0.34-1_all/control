Description: module for automated driving and testing of terminal-based programs
 Test::Expect is a module for automated driving and testing of
 terminal-based programs.  It is handy for testing interactive programs
 which have a prompt, and is based on the same concepts as the Tcl
 Expect tool.  As in Expect::Simple, the Expect object is made
 available for tweaking.
 .
 Test::Expect is intended for use in a test script.
