Description: Perl module to test file attributes
 Test::File provides a collection of test utilities for file attributes.
 .
 Some file attributes depend on the owner of the process testing the file in
 the same way the file test operators do. For instance, root (or super-user or
 Administrator) may always be able to read files no matter the permissions.
