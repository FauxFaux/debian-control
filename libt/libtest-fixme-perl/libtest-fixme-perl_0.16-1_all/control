Description: Perl module to check code for FIXME declarations
 When coding it is common to come up against problems that need to be
 addressed but that are not a big deal at the moment. What generally happens
 is that the coder adds comments like:
 .
  # FIXME - add checking of user privileges here.
 .
 Test::Fixme allows you to add a test file that ensures that none of these get
 forgotten in the module.
