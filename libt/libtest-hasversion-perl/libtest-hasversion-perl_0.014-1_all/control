Description: Perl library to check that Perl modules have version numbers
 Do you wanna check that every one of your Perl modules in a distribution has
 a version number? You wanna make sure you don't forget the brand new modules
 you just added? Well, that's the module you have been looking for. Use it!
 .
 Do you wanna check someone else's distribution to make sure the author have
 not committed the sin of leaving Perl modules without a version that can be
 used to tell if you have this or that feature? Test::HasVersion is also for
 you, nasty little fellow.
 .
 There's a script test_version which is installed with this distribution. You
 may invoke it from within the root directory of a distribution you just
 unpacked, and it will check every .pm file in the directory and under lib/
 (if any).
