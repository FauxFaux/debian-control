Description: Perl extension for testing HTML output
 This is a module to test the HTML output of your programs in simple
 test scripts. It can test a scalar (presumably containing HTML) for
 the presence (or absence, or a specific number) of tags having (or
 lacking) specific attributes. Unspecified attributes are ignored,
 and the attribute values can be specified as either scalars (meaning
 a match succeeds if the strings are identical) or regular expressions
 (meaning that a match succeeds if the actual attribute value is matched
 by the given RE) or undef (meaning that the attribute must not
 be present).
