Description: local HTTP server for testing other perl modules
 Test::HTTP::LocalServer implements a tiny web server suitable for running
 "live" tests of HTTP clients against it. It also takes care of cleaning %ENV
 from settings that influence the use of a local proxy etc.
 .
 Use this web server if you write an HTTP client and want to exercise its
 behaviour in your test suite without talking to the outside world.
