Description: framework for more readable interactive test scripts
 Test::Inter is another framework for perl developers writing test scripts. It
 is loosely inspired by Test::More, and has most of it's functionality, but it
 is not a drop-in replacement.
 .
 This framework offers the ability to write the tests in a more readable
 format, and you can access specific tests in a reasonably interactive fashion.
