Description: Perl module to skip tests in a declarative way
 Test::Is is a simple way of following the specifications of the environment
 variables available for Perl tests as defined as one of the "Lancaster
 Consensus" at Perl QA Hackathon 2013. Those variables (NONINTERACTIVE_TESTING,
 EXTENDED_TESTING) define which tests should be skipped.
 .
 If the environment does not match what the author of the test expected, the
 complete test is skipped (in the same way as use Test::More skip_all => ...).
