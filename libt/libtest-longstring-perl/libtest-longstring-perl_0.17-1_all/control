Description: module to test for string equality
 Test::LongString is a Perl test module that provides some functions useful
 for testing the equality of long strings. Upon failure, it will provide more
 useful diagnostic output by:
 .
  * Reporting lengths of the strings that have been compared
  * Reporting length of the common prefix of strings
  * Automatically escaping non-ASCII characters as \x{xx}
