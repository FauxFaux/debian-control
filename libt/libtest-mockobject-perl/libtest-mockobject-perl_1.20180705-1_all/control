Description: Perl extension for emulating troublesome interfaces
 Test::MockObject allows you to control interfaces for writing
 tests in perl. It can emulate interfaces that you normally
 would use (such as a database or other external items).
 You don't have to recreate the functionality, but simply mimic
 the input and output.
