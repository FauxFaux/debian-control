Description: module to check source for encoding misbehavior
 Many modern text editors automatically save files using UTF-8
 encoding, however, perl interpreter does not expects it by default.
 Whereas this does not represent a big deal on (most) backend-oriented
 programs, Web framework (Catalyst, Mojolicious) based applications
 will suffer of so-called Mojibake (lit. "unintelligible sequence of
 characters").
 .
 Test::Mojibake lets you check for inconsistencies in source and
 documentation encoding, and report its results in a standard
 Test::Simple fashion.
