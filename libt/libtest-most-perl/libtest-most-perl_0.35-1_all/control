Description: Perl module with the most commonly needed test functions and features
 Test::Most provides the most commonly used testing functions and gives
 a bit more fine-grained control over your test suite.
 .
 All functions from the following modules will automatically be
 exported:
 .
  * Test::More
  * Test::Exception
  * Test::Differences
  * Test::Deep
  * Test::Warn
 .
 This is useful when one is used to most of the above modules but
 wouldn't want to bother to load them all explicitly.
 .
 Test::Most also provides a couple of routines to control tests
 behaviour in case of errors.
