Description: module to ensure that tests needing a display have one
 When testing GUI applications, sometimes applications or modules absolutely
 insist on a display, even just to load a module without actually showing any
 objects.
 .
 Regardless, this makes GUI applications pretty much impossible to build and
 test on headless or automated systems. And it fails to the point of not even
 running the Makefile.PL script because a dependency needs a display so it can
 be loaded to find a version.
 .
 In these situations, what is needed is a fake display.
 .
 The Test::NeedsDisplay module will search around and try to find a way to load
 some sort of display that can be used for the testing.
