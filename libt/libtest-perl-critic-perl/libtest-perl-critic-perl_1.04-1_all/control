Description: module to use Perl::Critic in test scripts
 Test::Perl::Critic wraps the Perl::Critic engine in a convenient subroutine
 suitable for test programs written using the Test::More framework. This makes
 it easy to integrate coding-standards enforcement into the build process. For
 ultimate convenience (at the expense of some flexibility), see the criticism
 pragma.
 .
 If you'd like to try Perl::Critic without installing anything, there is a web
 service available at http://perlcritic.com. The web service does not support
 all the configuration features that are available in the native Perl::Critic
 API, but it should give you a good idea of what it does.
