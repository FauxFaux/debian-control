Description: module that allows gradual enforcement of coding standards
 Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive allows Perl coding standards to be
 enforced in a gradual way. With it hooked into a continuous integration
 system, it will fail any changes that increase the number of policy
 violations, as judged using Perl::Critic.
