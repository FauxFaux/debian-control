Description: test utility checking POD for HTTP 404 links
 Test::Pod::No404s looks for any http(s) links in your POD and verifies that
 they will not return a 404. It uses LWP::UserAgent for the heavy lifting, and
 simply lets you know if it failed to retrieve the document. More
 specifically, it uses $response->is_error as the "test."
 .
 Normally, you wouldn't want this test to be run during end-user installation
 because they might have no internet! It is HIGHLY recommended that this be
 used only for module authors' RELEASE_TESTING phase. To do that, just modify
 the synopsis to add an env check :)
