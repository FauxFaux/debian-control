Description: test framework for TCP client libraries using POE
 Test::POE::Server::TCP is a Perl Object Environment (POE, see libpoe-perl)
 component that provides a TCP server framework for inclusion in your client
 module's test cases. Once registered, a session will receive events related
 to client connections, disconnections, input and any flushed output. It will
 also get a unique client identifier which may be used in communication with
 the client component when sending data to the client or ending a connection.
