Description: Perl module to check that file names in a distribution are portable
 Test::Portability::Files is used to check the portability across operating
 systems of the names of the files present in the distribution of a module.
 The tests use the advices given in perlport/"Files and Filesystems". The
 author of a distribution can select which tests to execute.
 .
 To use this module, simply copy the code from the synopsis in a test file
 named t/portfs.t for example, and add it to your MANIFEST. You can delete the
 call to options() to enable only most common tests.
