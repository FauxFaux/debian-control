Description: Test RDF data for validity and equality
 Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a standard model for data
 interchange on the Web.
 .
 Test::RDF provides tools for testing code which deals with RDF. It can
 test RDF for validity, check if two RDF graphs are the same, or
 subgraphs of each other, if a URI is or is not in a dataset, if it has
 certain subjects, predicates, objects or literals. It can also test to
 see if a full pattern is present or absent.
