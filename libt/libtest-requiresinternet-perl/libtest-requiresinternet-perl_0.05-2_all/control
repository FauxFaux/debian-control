Description: module to easily test network connectivity
 Test::RequiresInternet is intended to easily test network connectivity
 before functional tests begin to non-local Internet resources. It does not
 require any modules beyond those supplied in core Perl.
 .
 If the environment variable NO_NETWORK_TESTING is set, then the tests will be
 skipped without attempting any socket connections.
 .
 If the sockets cannot connect to the specified hosts and ports, the exception
 is caught, reported and the tests skipped.
