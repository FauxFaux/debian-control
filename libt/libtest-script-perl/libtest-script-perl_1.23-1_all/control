Description: Perl test module for scripts
 Test::Script is a Perl module that provides a series of basic tests for those
 files usually found in the bin or scripts directory of your package. It aims
 to provide your scripts with perfect platform-compatability and in a way that
 is as unobstrusive as possible. The general idea is that if a program works
 on a platform, then Test::Script tests should also pass on that platform.
