Description: Perl module for testing scripts as subprocesses
 Test::Script::Run provides Test::More-compatible subroutines for testing
 scripts in a Perl module distribution's bin/ directory using IPC::Run3 to
 spawn the scripts as subprocesses.
 .
 Subroutines are provided for running scripts and simply checking that the
 return value is good, as well as capturing a script's STDOUT and STDERR and
 comparing against expected output.
