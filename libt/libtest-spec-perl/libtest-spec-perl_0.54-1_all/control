Description: Perl module to write tests in a declarative specification style
 This is a declarative specification-style testing system for behavior-driven
 development (BDD) in Perl. The tests (a.k.a. examples) are named with strings
 instead of subroutine names, so your fingers will suffer less fatigue from
 underscore-itis, with the side benefit that the test reports are more
 legible.
 .
 Test::Spec is inspired by and borrows heavily from RSpec, a BDD tool for the
 Ruby programming language.
