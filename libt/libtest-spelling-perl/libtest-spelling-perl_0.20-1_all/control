Description: Perl module for spellchecking pod formatted text
 Test::Spelling lets you check the spelling of a POD file, and report
 its results in standard Test::More fashion. This module requires a
 spellcheck program such as spell, aspell, ispell, or hunspell.
 .
 You can add your own stopwords, which are words that should be ignored by the
 spell check. See libpod-spell-perl (which this module is built upon) for a
 variety of ways to add per-file stopwords to each .pm file. If you have a lot
 of stopwords, it's useful to put them in your test file's DATA section.
