Description: test module for checking the syntax of use strict and test coverage
 Test::Strict tests if the code compiles and inter-operates with
 Test::Simple modules. Another good practice this module can test
 is to "use strict;" in all perl files.
 .
 By setting a minimum test coverage through all_cover_ok(), a code
 author can ensure his code is tested above a preset level of kwalitee
 (CPAN quality metrics) throughout the development cycle. Along with
 Test::Pod, this module can provide the first tests to setup for a
 module author.
