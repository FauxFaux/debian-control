Description: test module for temporary directories that stick around when tests fail
 Test::TempDir::Tiny works with Test::More to create temporary directories
 that stick around if tests fail.
 .
 It is loosely based on Test::TempDir, but with less complexity, greater
 portability and zero non-core dependencies.
