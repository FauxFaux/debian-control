Description: unit testing framework for Perl
 Test::Unit::* is a sophisticated unit testing framework for Perl
 that is derived from the JUnit testing framework for Java by Kent
 Beck and Erich Gamma.
 .
 While this framework is originally intended to support unit
 testing in an object-oriented development paradigm (with support
 for inheritance of tests etc.), Test::Unit::Procedural is intended
 to provide a simpler interface to the framework that is more
 suitable for use in a scripting style environment.
