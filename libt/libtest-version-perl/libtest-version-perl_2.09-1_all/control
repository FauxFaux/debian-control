Description: module for checking the sanity of versions in modules
 Test::Versions's goal is to be a one stop shop for checking to see that
 the versions in the modules across a CPAN distribution are sane.
 .
 It has checks to ensure that all modules have a VERSION defined, and that the
 VERSION is valid.
