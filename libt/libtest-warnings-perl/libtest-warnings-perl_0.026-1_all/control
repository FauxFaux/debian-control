Description: Perl module to test for warnings and the lack of them
 If you've ever tried to use Test::NoWarnings to confirm there are no
 warnings generated by your tests, combined with the convenience of
 done_testing to not have to declare a test count, you'll have
 discovered that these two features do not play well together, as the
 test count will be calculated before the warnings test is run,
 resulting in a TAP error.
 .
 Test::Warnings is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for
 Test::NoWarnings. It can also be used as a replacement for Test::Warn,
 if you wish to test the content of expected warnings.
