Description: compare XML in perl tests
 This Perl module, Test::XML, provides tools for testing code which
 deals with XML.  These tools are compatible with the Test::More and
 Test::Simple modules.  At present, there is generic XML comparison
 support, as well as modules for dealing with XML::SAX, XML::Twig and
 XML::XPath handlers.
