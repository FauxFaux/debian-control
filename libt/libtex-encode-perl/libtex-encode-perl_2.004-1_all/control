Description: Perl module to transform UTF-8 strings into TeX
 TeX::Encode provides a simple way to encode arbitrary UTF-8 strings into LaTeX
 escapes using mapping tables provided by Pod::LaTeX and HTML::Entities.
 .
 This module only covers a subset of the Unicode character set and has limited
 facilities for converting TeX back to UTF-8 (this is because TeX is in essence
 a programming language, and this module does not yet implement TeX).
