Description: Perl interface to the GNU Aspell library
 Text::Aspell provides a Perl interface to the GNU Aspell library.  The
 GNU Aspell library provides access to system spelling libraries,
 including a spell checker.
 .
 This module is to meet the need of looking up many words, one at a
 time, in a single session.  It is a perl xs interface which should
 provide good performance in comparison to forking the aspell program
 for every word.
