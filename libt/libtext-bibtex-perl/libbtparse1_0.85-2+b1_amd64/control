Description: C library to parse BibTeX files
 btparse is the C component of btOOL, a pair of libraries for parsing and
 processing BibTeX files. It is built on top of a lexical analyzer and parser
 constructed using PCCTS. The library provides entry points to the parser,
 functions to traverse and query the abstract-syntax tree that it produces, and
 some functions for processing strings in "the BibTeX way".
