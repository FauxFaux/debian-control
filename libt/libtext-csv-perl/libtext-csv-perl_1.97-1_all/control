Description: comma-separated values manipulator (using XS or PurePerl)
 Text::CSV provides facilities for the composition and decomposition of files
 containing comma-separated value records. An instance of the Text::CSV class
 can combine fields into a CSV string and parse a CSV string into fields.
 .
 The module accepts either strings or files as input and can utilize any
 user-specified characters as delimiters, separators, and escapes so it is
 perhaps better called ASV (anything separated values) rather than just CSV.
 .
 This module will automatically select the best available implementation of
 the algorithm, whether the Pure Perl version present in this package, or the
 C/XS implementation, available in libtext-csv-xs-perl.
