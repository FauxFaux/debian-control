Description: module that converts Mediawiki markup into other text formats
 Wikipedia and its sister projects use the PHP Mediawiki to format
 their pages. Text::MediawikiFormat attempts to duplicate the Mediawiki
 formatting rules. Those formatting rules can be simple and easy to use, while
 providing more advanced options for the power user. They are also easy to
 translate into other, more complicated markup languages with this module. It
 creates HTML by default, but could produce valid POD, DocBook, XML, or any
 other format imaginable.
 .
 The most important function is Text::MediawikiFormat::format(). It is not
 exported by default, but will be exported as wikiformat() if any options at
 all are passed to the exporter, unless the name is overridden explicitly. See
 "EXPORT" for more information.
 .
 It should be noted that this module is written as a drop in replacement for
 Text::WikiMarkup that expands on that modules functionality and provides a
 default rule set that may be used to format text like the PHP Mediawiki. It
 is also well to note early that if you just want a Mediawiki clone (you don't
 need to customize it heavily and you want integration with a back end
 database), you should look at Wiki::Toolkit::Formatter::Mediawiki.
