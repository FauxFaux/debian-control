Description: modern soundex module providing phonetic encoding of words
 Text::Metaphone provides the Metaphone() function, whereby a string/word
 is broken down into a rough approximation of its English phonetic
 pronunciation. Very similar in concept  and purpose to soundex, but much
 more comprehensive in its approach.

 This module is C/XS accelerated.
