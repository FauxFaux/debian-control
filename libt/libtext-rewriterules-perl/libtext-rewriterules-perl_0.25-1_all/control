Description: system for rewriting text using regexp-based rules
 Text::RewriteRules uses a simplified syntax for regexp-based rules for
 rewriting text. You define a set of rules, and the system applies them
 until no more rule can be applied. The rules are defined using a specific
 non-perl syntax inside the Perl program. This improves legibility of big
 rewriting rules systems.
