Description: perl module to process text templates
 Text::Template is a library for generating form letters, building
 HTML pages, or filling in templates generally. A `template' is a
 piece of text that has little Perl programs embedded in it here and
 there. When you `fill in' a template, you evaluate the little
 programs and replace them with their values.
