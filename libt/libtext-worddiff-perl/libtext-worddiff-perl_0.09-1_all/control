Description: module to track changes between documents
 Text::WordDiff is a variation on the lovely Text::Diff module. Rather than
 generating traditional line-oriented diffs, however, it generates
 word-oriented diffs. This can be useful for tracking changes in narrative
 documents or documents with very long lines. To diff source code, one is
 still best off using Text::Diff. But if you want to see how a short story
 changed from one version to the next, this module will do the job very
 nicely.
