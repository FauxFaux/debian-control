Description: scalable template engine for Perl 5 (C/XS accelerated)
 Text::Xslate is a template engine, tuned for persistent applications, safe
 as an HTML generator, and with rich features.
 .
 There are a lot of template engines in CPAN, for example Template-Toolkit,
 Text::MicroTemplate, HTML::Template, and so on, but all of them have some
 weak points: a full-featured template engine may be slow, while a fast
 template engine may be too simple to use. This is why Text::Xslate is
 developed, which is to be the best template engine for web applications.
 .
 The concept of Text::Xslate is strongly influenced by Text::MicroTemplate and
 Template-Toolkit 2, but the central philosophy of Text::Xslate is different
 from them. That is, the philosophy is one of sandboxing; that the template
 logic should not have no access outside the template beyond your permission.
