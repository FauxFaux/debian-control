Description: Ada library for writing console applications: development
 The Texttools packages are a GPL, ncurses-based library for the Linux
 console.  Texttools contain more than 600 procedures and functions to
 create windows, draw scroll bars, handle the mouse and keyboard
 events, play sounds, and much more.  The Texttools package also
 provides a thick binding to Linux kernel calls.  You can create a wide
 variety of application programs using Texttools alone.
 .
 Install this package if you want to write Ada programs that use
 Texttools.
