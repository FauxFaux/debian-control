Description: scanning DNA sequence with a position weight matrix
 The TFBS perl modules comprise a set of routines to interact with the
 Transfac and Jaspar databases that describe a special family of proteins,
 the transcription factors. These bind to genomic DNA to initiate (or
 prevent) the readout of a gene.  Once multiple binding sites are known
 for a transcription factor, these are gathered in a single file and are
 aligned in order to find position-specific characteristica that might
 be used to predict such binding events in novel DNA sequences.

 Note: the TFBS perl module is no longer under active development.  All the
 functionality can be found in the TFBSTools Bioconductor package; users are
 highly encouraged to switch.  <http://bioconductor.org/packages/TFBSTools/>
