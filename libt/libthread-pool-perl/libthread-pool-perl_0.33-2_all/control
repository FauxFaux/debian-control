Description: group of threads for performing similar jobs
 The Thread::Pool module allows you to set up a group of (worker) threads to
 execute a (large) number of similar jobs that need to be executed
 asynchronously. The routine that actually performs the job (the "do"
 routine), must be specified as a name or a reference to a (anonymous)
 subroutine.
