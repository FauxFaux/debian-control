Description: C++ thread pool library
 A thread pool is a software design pattern for achieving concurrency of
 execution in a computer program. Often also called a replicated workers
 or worker-crew model,[1] a thread pool maintains multiple threads
 waiting for tasks to be allocated for concurrent execution by the
 supervising program.
 .
 This package contains a shared library with a thread pool
 implementation.
