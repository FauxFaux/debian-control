Description: module to serialize data-structures between threads
 The Thread::Serialize module is a library for centralizing the routines used
 to serialize data-structures between threads. Because of this central
 location, other modules such as Thread::Conveyor, Thread::Pool or Thread::Tie
 can benefit from the same optimilizations that may take place here in the
 future.
