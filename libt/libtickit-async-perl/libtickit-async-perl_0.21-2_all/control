Description: module to use Tickit with IO::Async
 Thes Tickit::Async module allows a Tickit user interface to run alongside
 other IO::Async-driven code, using IO::Async as a source of IO events.
 .
 As a shortcut convenience, a containing IO::Async::Loop will be constructed
 using the default magic constructor the first time it is needed, if the
 object is not already a member of a loop. This will allow a Tickit::Async
 object to be used without being aware it is not a simple Tickit object.
 .
 To avoid accidentally creating multiple loops, callers should be careful to
 add the Tickit::Async object to the main application's loop if one already
 exists as soon as possible after construction.
