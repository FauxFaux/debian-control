Description: module to provide tied handle that hides the beginning of a file
 Tie::Handle::Offset provides a file handle that hides the beginning of a
 file. After opening, the file is positioned at the offset location. "seek()"
 and "tell()" calls are modified to preserve the offset.
 .
 For example, "tell($fh)" will return 0, though the actual file position is at
 the offset. Likewise, "seek($fh,80,0)" will seek to 80 bytes from the offset
 instead of 80 bytes from the actual start of the file.
 .
 The included Tie::Handle::SkipHeader module automatically hides an
 email-style message header. After opening the file, it reads up to a blank or
 white-space-only line and sets the offset to the next byte.
