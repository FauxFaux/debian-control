Description: module for tieing iCal files to Perl hashes
 Tie::iCal represents an RFC2445 iCalendar file as a Perl hash. Each key in
 the hash represents an iCalendar component like VEVENT, VTODO or VJOURNAL.
 Each component in the file must have a unique UID property as specified in
 the RFC 2445. A file containing non-unique UIDs can be converted to have
 only unique UIDs (see samples/uniquify.pl).
 .
 The module makes very little effort in understanding what each iCalendar
 property means and concentrates on the format of the iCalendar file only.
