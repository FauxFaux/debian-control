Description: simple way to tie Perl variables
 This package provides the Perl module Tie::Simple. This module adds to
 tie function the ability to quickly create new types of tie objects
 without creating a complete Tie::Something class. The idea is to make
 the programmers life easier when it comes to single-use ties which are
 sometime useful.
 .
 Tie::Simple class is actually a front-end to other classes which
 really do all the work once tied, but this package does the dwimming
 to automatically figure out what you're trying to do.
