Description: Perl C/XS module representing date and time of day with UTC offset
 Time::Moment is an immutable object representing a date and time of day with
 an offset from UTC in the ISO 8601 calendar system.
 .
 Time is measured in nanoseconds since 0001-01-01T00Z. Leap seconds are
 ignored.  Time::Moment can represent all epoch integers from -62,135,596,800
 to 2,534,02,300,799; this range suffices to measure times to nanosecond
 precision for any instant that is within 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to
 9999-12-31T23:59:59Z.
