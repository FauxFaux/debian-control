Description: perl module for elapsed and estimated finish time reporting
 Time::Progress displays progress information for long-running processes. This
 can be percentage complete, time elapsed, estimated time remaining, an ASCII
 progress bar, or any combination of those.

 It is useful for code where you perform a number of steps, or iterations of a
 loop, where the number of iterations is known before you start the loop.
