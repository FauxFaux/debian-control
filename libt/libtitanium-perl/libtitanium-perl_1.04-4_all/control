Description: strong, lightweight web application framework for Perl
 Titanium is solid and mature. While it has a new name, the reality is
 that Titanium is simply a more user-friendly packaging of the mature
 CGI::Application framework and some useful plugins.
 .
 Titanium is lightweight; it has a light core and the plugins it uses employ
 lazy-loading whenever possible. It runs well in a plain CGI environment and
 provides excellent performance in a persistent environment such as FastCGI
 or mod_perl.
 .
 Applications are compatible with plugins for CGI::Application, so you can add
 additional features as your needs evolve.
