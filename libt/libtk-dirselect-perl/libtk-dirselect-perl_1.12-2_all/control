Description: cross-platform directory selection widget
 Tk::DirSelect provides a cross-platform directory selection widget. A
 context menu (right-click or <Button3>) allows the
 creation, renaming, and deletion of directories while browsing.
 .
 Note: Perl/Tk 804 added the chooseDirectory method which uses native
 system dialogs where available. Unfortunately, a non-existent
 directory cannot (yet?) be chosen. If you want a native feel for
 your program, and do not need non-existent directory choice, you
 probably want to use chooseDirectory method instead of Tk::DirSelect.
