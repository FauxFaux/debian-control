Description: various Tk Perl widgets
 A contribution to the ever growing collection of Tk Widgets, currently it
 includes:
 .
     Tk::Cloth       - An OO interface to Tk::Canvas
     Tk::TFrame      - A frame with a title
     Tk::NumEntry    - An entry widget that accepts numbers and has up/down
                       buttons for in/decrement.
     Tk::FireButton  - Button that keeps invoking command when pressed
 .
 Tk::Pane and Tk::ProgressBar are no longer part of this
 distribution, because they are included in standard Perl/Tk since
 800.016.
