Description: Tk entry widget with history
 Tk::HistEntry implements an entry widget with history. You may use the up
 and down keys to select older entries (or use the associated listbox).
 .
 The widget comes in two flavors: the "HistEntry" widget is an
 inherited BrowseEntry widget where you see history in the associated
 listbox, too. The "SimpleHistEntry" widget is a plain Entry widget.
