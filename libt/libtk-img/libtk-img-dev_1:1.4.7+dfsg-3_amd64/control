Description: Extended image format support for Tcl/Tk (development files)
 Img is a package to enhance Tk by providing support for various image
 formats such as XPM, GIF (transparency supported, but not LZW), PNG,
 JPEG, TIFF, and PostScript.

 The libimg library can be loaded dynamically into Tcl/Tk scripts to
 provide the image handling functions.

 This package includes Tcl stub libraries and headers, which are necessary
 to develop C-based extensions using Img.
