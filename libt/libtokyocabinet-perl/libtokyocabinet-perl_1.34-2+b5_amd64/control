Description: Perl Binding of Tokyo Cabinet
 Tokyo Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database.  The database
 is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of a key and a value.
 Every key and value is serial bytes with variable length.  Both binary data
 and character string can be used as a key and a value.  There is neither
 concept of data tables nor data types.  Records are organized in hash table,
 B+ tree, or fixed-length array.
