Description: Perl module for reading and writing TOML files
 TOML implements a parser for Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language,
 as defined at https://github.com/mojombo/toml.
 .
 TOML aims to be a minimal configuration file format that is easy
 to read due to obvious semantics.
 It is designed to map unambiguously to a hash table and it is
 easy to parse into data structures in a wide variety of languages.
