Description: Keep your handy modules organized
 The Toolkit module provides a standard location to store modules that you use
 all the time, and then loads them for you automatically. For example, instead
 of always writing:
 .
  use strict;
  use warnings;
  use Carp;
  use Smart::Comments;
 .
 in every program/module, you can just write:
 .
  use Toolkit;
 .
 and put all your favorite modules in a file.
