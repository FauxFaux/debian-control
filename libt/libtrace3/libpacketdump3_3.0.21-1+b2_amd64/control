Description: network packet parsing and human-readable display library
 libpacketdump provides a library which can parse packets and display the
 packet contents in a nice human-readable form. The output is similar to that
 produced by tcpdump, although the formatting is somewhat more verbose.
 .
 libpacketdump is developed by the WAND Network Research Group at Waikato
 University in New Zealand.
