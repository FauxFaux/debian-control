Description: development headers for the libwandio library
 This package contains development headers and other ancillary files for
 the libwandio library.
 .
 libwandio is a file I/O library that will read and write both compressed and
 uncompressed files. All compression-related operations are performed in a
 separate thread where possible resulting in significant performance gains for
 tasks where I/O is the limiting factor (most simple trace analysis tasks are
 I/O-limited).
 .
 libwandio is developed by the WAND Network Research Group at Waikato
 University, New Zealand.
