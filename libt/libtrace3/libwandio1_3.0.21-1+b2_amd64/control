Description: multi-threaded file compression and decompression library
 File I/O library that will read and write both compressed and uncompressed
 files. All compression-related operations are performed in a separate thread
 where possible resulting in significant performance gains for tasks where I/O
 is the limiting factor (most simple trace analysis tasks are I/O-limited).
 .
 libwandio is developed by the WAND Network Research Group at Waikato
 University, New Zealand.
