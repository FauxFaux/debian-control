Description: Development files for libtranscript
 libtranscript is a character-set conversion library, much like the iconv set of
 functions. The library allows great control over the conversions. It was
 designed for use in programs which use Unicode internally, using UTF-8, UTF-16
 or UTF-32/UCS-4.
 .
 This package contains the header files to compile programs against
 libtranscript, and to develop converters for use in libtranscript. It also
 contains the ucm2ltc program to create compilable converters from .ucm files.
