Description: Character set conversion library
 libtranscript is a character-set conversion library, much like the iconv set of
 functions. The library allows great control over the conversions. It was
 designed for use in programs which use Unicode internally, using UTF-8, UTF-16
 or UTF-32/UCS-4.
 .
 libtranscript currently provides converters for the following encodings:
 .
  - Unicode UTF-{7,8,16LE,16BE,32LE,32BE}, CESU-8, GB-18030.
  - ISO-8859-{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7-2003,8,9,10,11,13,14,15,16}.
  - Windows-125{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}.
