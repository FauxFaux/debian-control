Description: unofficial interface to the efa.vrr.de German itinerary service
 Travel::Routing::DE::VRR is a client for the efa.vrr.de web interface. You
 pass it the start/stop of your journey, maybe a time and a date and more
 details, and it returns the up-to-date scheduled connections between those
 two stops.
 .
 Travel::Routing::DE::VRR uses the included Travel::Routing::DE::EFA which is
 a generic interface to various EFA-based itinerary services.
