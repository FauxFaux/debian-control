Description: a multi node tree object
 Tree::MultiNode, Tree::MultiNode::Node, and MultiNode::Handle
 of objects are written to model the Tree heirarchical structure.
 Each child object can be the tree itself. The tree has no
 internal sorting, though all operations perserve the order
 of the child nodes.
