Description: automatically return a true value when a file is required
 Perl's require builtin (and its use wrapper) requires the files it loads to
 return a true value. This is usually accomplished by placing a single
 .
 1;
 .
 statement at the end of included scripts or modules. It's not onerous to add
 but it's a speed bump on the Perl novice's road to enlightenment.
 .
 This module packages this "return true" behaviour so that it need not be
 written explicitly.
