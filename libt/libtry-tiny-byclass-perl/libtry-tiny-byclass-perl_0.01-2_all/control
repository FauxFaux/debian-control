Description: selectively catch exceptions by class name
 This module is a simple wrapper around Try::Tiny, which see. It
 re-exports try, catch, and finally.  In addition, it provides a way to
 catch only some exceptions by filtering on the class (including
 superclasses and consumed roles) of an exception object.
