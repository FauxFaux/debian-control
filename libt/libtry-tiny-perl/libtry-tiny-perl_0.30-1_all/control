Description: module providing minimalistic try/catch
 Try::Tiny is a Perl module that provides bare bones try/catch statements. It
 is designed to eliminate common mistakes with eval blocks, and NOTHING else.
 .
 The main focus of this module is to provide simple and reliable error
 handling for those having a hard time installing TryCatch, but who still want
 to write correct eval blocks without 5 lines of boilerplate each time.
