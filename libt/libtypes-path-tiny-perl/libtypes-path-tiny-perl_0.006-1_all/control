Description: Path::Tiny types and coercions for Moose and Moo
 Types::Path::Tiny provides types and coercions useful for dealing
 with Path::Tiny objects as Moose or Moo attributes.
 .
 It handles two important types of coercion:
 .
  • coercing objects with overloaded stringification;
  • coercing to absolute paths.
 .
 It also can check to ensure that files or directories exist.
