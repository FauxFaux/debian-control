Description: module providing simple data types for common serialisation formats
 Types::Serialiser provides some extra datatypes that are used by common
 serialisation formats such as JSON or CBOR. The idea is to have a repository
 of simple/small constants and containers that can be shared by different
 implementations so they become interoperable between each other.
