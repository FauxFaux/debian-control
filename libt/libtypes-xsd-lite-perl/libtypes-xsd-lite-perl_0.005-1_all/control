Description: type constraints based on a subset of XML schema datatypes
 Types::XSD::Lite provides all the type constraints from XML Schema that
 could be implemented without introducing extra runtime dependencies
 (above Type::Tiny). That's basically all of the XSD types, except
 datetime-related ones, and XML-specific ones (QNames, IDRefs, etc).
 .
 If you want the full set of XML Schema types, see Types::XSD.
