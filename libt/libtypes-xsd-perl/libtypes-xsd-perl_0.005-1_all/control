Description: type constraints based on XML schema datatypes
 Types::XSD is a type constraint library inspired by XML Schema, and
 built with Type::Library. It can be used as a type constraint library
 for Moo, Mouse or Moose, or used completely independently of any OO
 framework.
 .
 This module is an extension of Types::XSD::Lite which has fewer type
 constraints, but fewer dependencies.
