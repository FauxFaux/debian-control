Description: Perl module for mapping charsets from and to UTF16 Unicode
 This module converts strings from and to 2-byte Unicode UCS2 format.
 All mappings happen via 2 byte UTF16 encodings, not via 1 byte UTF8
 encoding.  To convert between UTF8 and UTF16 use Unicode::String.
 .
 For historical reasons this module coexists with Unicode::Map8.
 Please use Unicode::Map8 unless you need to care for >1 byte
 character sets, e.g. chinese GB2312.  Anyway, if you stick to the
 basic functionality (see documentation) you can use both modules
 equivalently.
 .
 The 'libwww-perl' package is needed to run the example mirrorMappings.
