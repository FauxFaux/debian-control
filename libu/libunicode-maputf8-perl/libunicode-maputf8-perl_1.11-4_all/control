Description: Perl module for converting between any character sets and UTF8
 Unicode::MapUTF8 provides an adapter layer between core routines for
 converting to and from UTF8 and other encodings.  In essence, a way
 to give multiple existing Unicode modules a single common interface
 so you don't have to know the underlying implementations to do
 simple UTF8 to-from other character set encoding conversions.  As
 such, it wraps the Unicode::String, Unicode::Map8, Unicode::Map and
 Jcode modules in a standardized and simple API.
 .
 This also provides general character set conversion operation based
 on UTF8 - it is possible to convert between any two compatible and
 supported character sets via a simple two step chaining of
 conversions.
 .
 As with most things Perlish - if you give it a few big chunks of text
 to chew on instead of lots of small ones it will handle many more
 characters per second.
 .
 By design, it can be easily extended to encompass any new charset
 encoding conversion modules that arrive on the scene.
