Description: Older Perl modules for Unicode string manipulation
 This package provides Unicode::String, which manipulates strings of
 characters in various Unicode representations, and Unicode::CharName,
 which maps Unicode characters to official character names.
 .
 These modules predate native Unicode support inside Perl.  Normally, the
 integrated Perl Unicode support and modules such as Encode should be used
 instead of these modules.  They are provided primarily for their
 additional utility functions and to support other Perl code with
 dependencies on these modules.  Be aware that Unicode::CharName only
 includes Unicode characters up to Unicode 4.1 and the character name
 tables included with Perl are more complete.
