Description: library for handling numbers as Unicode strings
 Libuninum is a library for converting Unicode strings to numbers and numbers to
 Unicode strings. Standard functions like strtoul, strtod, and sprintf do
 this for numbers written in the usual Western number system using the
 Indo-Arabic numerals, but they do not handle other number systems.
 .
 Libuninum can handle them properly.
