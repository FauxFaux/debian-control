Description: Methods to output nicer names for your Perl modules/classes
 Class names in Perl often don't sound great when spoken, or look good
 when written in prose. For this reason, the module authors tend to
 say things like "customer" or "basket" when they are referring to
 "My::Site::User::Customer" or "My::Site::Shop::Basket". They thought
 it would be nice if their classes knew what they would prefer to call
 them.
 .
 The UNIVERSAL::moniker module will add a "moniker" (and
 "plural_moniker") method to "UNIVERSAL", and so to every class or
 module.
