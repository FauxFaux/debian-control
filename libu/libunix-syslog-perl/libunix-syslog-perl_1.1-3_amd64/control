Description: Perl interface to the UNIX syslog(3) calls
 Unix::Syslog provides an interface to the system logger syslogd(8) via
 Perl's XSUBs. The implementation attempts to resemble the native
 libc-functions of your system, so that anyone being familiar with
 syslog.h should be able to use this module right away.
