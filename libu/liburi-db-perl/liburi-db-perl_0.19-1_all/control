Description: module to support database URI standard
 URI::db provides a Perl interface for a proposed standard for database
 connection URIs. They're inspired by JDBC URIs and PostgreSQL URIs, though
 they're a bit more formal. The specification for their format is documented
 in <https:/github.com/theory/db-uri/>.
 .
 This library also includes an interface to convert database URIs to DBI DSNs.
