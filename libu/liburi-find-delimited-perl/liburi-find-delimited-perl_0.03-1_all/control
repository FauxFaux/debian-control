Description: Find URIs which may be wrapped in enclosing delimiters
 Works like URI::Find, but is prepared for URIs in your text to be
 wrapped in a pair of delimiters and optionally have a title. This will
 be useful for processing text that already has some minimal markup in
 it, like bulletin board posts or wiki text.
