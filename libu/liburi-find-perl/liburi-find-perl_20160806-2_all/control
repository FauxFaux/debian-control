Description: module to find URIs in arbitrary text
 URI::Find does one thing: Finds URIs and URLs in plain text.  It finds
 them quickly and it finds them all (or what URI::URL considers a URI
 to be.)  It only finds URIs which include a scheme (http:// or the
 like); for something a bit less strict have a look at
 URI::Find::Schemeless.
