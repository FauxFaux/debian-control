Description: simple interface to URI::Find
 URI::Find is all very well, but sometimes you just want a list of the links
 in a given piece of text, or you want to change all the urls in some text
 somehow, and don't want to mess with callback interfaces.
 .
 URI::Find::Simple uses URI::Find, but hides the callback interface, providing
 two functions - one to list all the uris, and one to change all the uris.
