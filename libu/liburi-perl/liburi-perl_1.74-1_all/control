Description: module to manipulate and access URI strings
 URI is a collection of Perl modules that represent and manipulate Uniform
 Resource Identifier (URI) references as specified in RFC 2396.
 .
 URI objects can be used to access and manipulate the various components
 that make up these strings.  There are also methods to combine URIs in
 various ways.
 .
 The URI class replaces the URI::URL class that used to be distributed with
 libwww-perl. This package also includes an emulation of the old URI::URL
 interface, which implements both the old and the new interface.
