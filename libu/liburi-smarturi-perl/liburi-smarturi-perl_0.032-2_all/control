Description: subclass of URI which add an hostless object
 URI::SmartURI is a sort of "subclass" of URI using delegation with some extra
 methods, all the methods that work for URIs will work on these objects as
 well.
 .
 It's similar in spirit to URI::WithBase.
 .
 It's also completely safe to subclass for your own use.
