Description: module to provide mapping between URIs and on-disk storage
 URI::ToDisk is a Perl module which provides an object that can easily map
 between Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and on-disk storage. In several
 processes relating to working with the web, one may need to keep track of an
 area on disk which maps to a particular URI.
 .
 Using this information, the module can derive both a filesystem path and URI
 for any file or directory in this location that one might need to work with.
