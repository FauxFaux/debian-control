Description: module to manage a person's identities/roles
 User::Identity is a Perl module that provides a set of informational classes
 which are related to one user. This module attempts to be smart at providing
 defaults, conversions and often required combinations.
 .
 The identities do not implement any kind of storage, so they can be used by
 any Perl program. As a result, it is more flexible than an XML file to store
 the data. For instance, you can choose to store the data using Data::Dumper,
 Storable, DBI, AddressBook, etc.
