Description: module for simple user sessions management
 User::Simple provides a very simple framework for validating users,
 managing their sessions and storing a minimal set of information (this
 is, a meaningful user login/password pair and the user's name) via a
 database. The sessions can be used as identifiers for i.e. cookies on
 a Web system. The passwords are stored as MD5 hashes (this means, the
 password is not stored in clear text).
 .
 User::Simple was originally developed with a PostgreSQL database in
 mind, but should work with any DBI handle, be it from a real database
 (i.e. PostgreSQL, Firebird, MySQL) or from a file-based one
 (DBD::CSV, DBD::XBase, DBD::DBM, etc.)
