Description: Perl pragma to turn on UTF-8 everywhere
 The utf8 pragma allows you to write Perl source code encoded in UTF-8. That
 means UTF-8 strings, variable names, and regular expressions. utf8::all goes
 further, and makes @ARGV encoded in UTF-8, and filehandles are opened with
 UTF-8 encoding turned on by default (including STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR). If you
 don't want UTF-8 for a particular filehandle, you'll have to set binmode
 $filehandle.
