Description: vCard library - development files
 vCard is an Electronic Business Card format, as specified by the
 versit Consortium, useful for storing personal data.  libvc handles
 scanning a vCard file, parsing the vCard file into a data storage
 structure, manipulating the data storage structure, and writing back
 to file.  It was originally written for `rolo', but has been
 split-off as a generic library for general use.
 .
 This package contains static library, headers, and the development
 manpage for libvc.
