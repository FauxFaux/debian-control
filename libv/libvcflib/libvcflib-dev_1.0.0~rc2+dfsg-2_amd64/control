Description: C++ library for parsing and manipulating VCF files (development)
 The Variant Call Format (VCF) is a flat-file, tab-delimited textual format
 intended to concisely describe reference-indexed variations between
 individuals. VCF provides a common interchange format for the description of
 variation in individuals and populations of samples, and has become the defacto
 standard reporting format for a wide array of genomic variant detectors.
 .
 vcflib provides methods to manipulate and interpret sequence variation as it
 can be described by VCF. It is both:
 .
  * an API for parsing and operating on records of genomic variation as it can
    be described by the VCF format,
  * and a collection of command-line utilities for executing complex
    manipulations on VCF files.
 .
 This package contains the static library and the header files.
