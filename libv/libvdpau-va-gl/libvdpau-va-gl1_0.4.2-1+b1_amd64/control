Description: VDPAU driver with OpenGL/VAAPI backend
 Many applications can use VDPAU to accelerate portions of the video
 decoding process and video post-processing to the GPU video
 hardware. Unfortunately, there is no such library for many graphic
 chipsets. Some applications also support VA-API but many of them,
 including Adobe Flash Player, don't.
 .
 This library proposes a generic VDPAU library. It uses OpenGL under
 the hood to accelerate drawing and scaling and VA-API (if available)
 to accelerate video decoding.
