Description: framework providing Verilog support
 Verilog is a Perl framework providing Verilog support in the Perl language.
 It includes:
 .
  * Verilog::Getopt, which parses command line options similar to C++ and VCS
  * Verilog::Language, which knows the language keywords and parses numbers.
  * Verilog::Netlist, which builds netlists out of Verilog files. This allows
    easy scripts to determine things such as the hierarchy of modules.
  * Verilog::Parser, which invokes callbacks for language tokens
  * Verilog::Preproc, preprocesses the language, and allows reading
    post-processed files right from Perl without temporary files.
 .
 It also includes a variety of useful utilities:
 .
  * vpassert inserts PLIish warnings and assertions for any simulator
  * vppreproc preprocesses the complete Verilog 2001 and SystemVerilog
    language
  * vrename renames and cross-references Verilog symbols. It creates Verilog
    cross references and makes it easy to rename signal and module names over
    multiple files.
