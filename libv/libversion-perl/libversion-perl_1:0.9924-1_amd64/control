Description: Perl extension for Version Objects
 The version module implements version objects for older version of Perl and
 provides the version object API for all versions of Perl.
 .
 There are two different types of version objects supported by this modules,
 corresponding to the two different styles of versions in use:
  * Decimal Versions - The classic floating-point number $VERSION.
  * Dotted Decimal Versions - The more modern form of version assignment, with
    3 (or potentially more) integers separated by decimal points (e.g. v1.2.3).
