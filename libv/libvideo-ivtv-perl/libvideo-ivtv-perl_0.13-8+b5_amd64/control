Description: Perl extension for using V4l2 in the ivtv perl scripts
 The Video::ivtv module will provide helper methods for working with
 videodev2.h structures and making ioctl calls that have proven to be
 too difficult to create pack strings for in perl itself.
 .
 This is not supposed to be an equivalent of the Video::Capture::V4l
 module which was created for videodev.h.
