Description: Documentation for Python bindings for the C++ computer vision library
 Vision with Generic Algorithms (VIGRA) is a computer vision library
 that puts its main emphasis on flexible algorithms, because
 algorithms represent the principle know-how of this field. The
 library was consequently built using generic programming as
 introduced by Stepanov and Musser and exemplified in the C++ Standard
 Template Library. By writing a few adapters (image iterators and
 accessors) you can use VIGRA's algorithms on top of your data
 structures, within your environment.
 .
 This package contains documentation for Python bindings for the VIGRA library.
