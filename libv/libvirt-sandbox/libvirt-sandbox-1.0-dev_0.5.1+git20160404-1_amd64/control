Description: Development files for libvirt-sandbox library
 The Libvirt Sandbox project is an effort to facilitate the use of libvirt
 virtualization drivers for the purpose of sandboxing applications. It
 supports LXC and QEMU/KVM.
 .
 It provides a high level API to enable the construction of sandboxes
 and isolation from the need to understand the virtualization technology
 configuration.
 .
 It allows integration with systemd to setup service unit files inside a
 sandbox.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static libraries which are needed
 for developing the applications with libvirt-sandbox.
