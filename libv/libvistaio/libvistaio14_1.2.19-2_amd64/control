Description: Library for loading and storing various types of binary data
 Vistaio is a library that handles loading and storing of data in a
 cross-platform manner. Its virtue is that the otherwise binary
 files provide an ascii header that makes it easy to get information
 about the contens of a file. It supports a variety of data types
 like images, vector fields and graphs.
