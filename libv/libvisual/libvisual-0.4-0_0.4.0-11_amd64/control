Description: audio visualization framework
 Libvisual is a generic visualization framework that allows applications
 to easily access and manage visualization plugins.
 .
 Audio visualization is the process of making pretty moving images that
 are correlated in some way to the audio currently being played by a media
 player. Most audio visualization is tied to a specific application or media
 player, making it difficult to share code. Libvisual allows applications
 to use existing visualization plugins written for the libvisual framework.
 .
 This package provides the runtime libraries for libvisual. Libvisual is not
 very useful without visualization plugins, so it is highly recommended to
 install the libvisual-0.4-plugins package.
