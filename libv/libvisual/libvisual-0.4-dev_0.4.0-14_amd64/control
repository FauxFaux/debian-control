Description: audio visualization framework (development files)
 Libvisual is a generic visualization framework that allows applications
 to easily access and manage visualization plugins.
 .
 Audio visualization is the process of making pretty moving images that
 are correlated in some way to the audio currently being played by a media
 player. Most audio visualization is tied to a specific application or media
 player, making it difficult to share code. Libvisual allows applications
 to use existing visualization plugins written for the libvisual framework.
 .
 This package provides development headers and libraries used to compile
 applications that use libvisual.
