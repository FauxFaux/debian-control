Description: EC2 credential cache respecting expiration time for IAM roles
 VM::EC2::Security::CredentialCache provides a cache for an EC2's IAM
 credentials represented by VM::EC2::Security::Credentials. Rather than
 retriving the credentials for every possible call that uses them, cache them
 until they expire and retrieve them again if they have expired.
