Description: API to write one's own VNC server - library utility
 LibVNCServer makes writing a VNC server (or more correctly, a program
 exporting a framebuffer via the Remote Frame Buffer protocol) easy. It hides
 the programmer from the tedious task of managing clients and compression.
 .
 This package provides libvncserver-config utility, needed to obtain some
 option of the libvncserver library.
