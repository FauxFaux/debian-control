Description: API to write one's own VNC server - development files
 LibVNCServer makes writing a VNC server (or more correctly, a program
 exporting a framebuffer via the Remote Frame Buffer protocol) easy. It hides
 the programmer from the tedious task of managing clients and compression.
 .
 This is the development package which contains headers and static libraries
 for libvncserver.
