Description: Library of free natural language processing tools
 Libvoikko is a library of free natural language processing tools. It
 aims to provide support for languages that are not well served by
 other existing free linguistic tools.
 .
 The library supports multiple backends, of which VFST and
 HFST are enabled in the default build:
 .
  - VFST: Finite state transducer format used for Finnish morphology
    and as an experimental language independent backend.
  - HFST (Helsinki Finite-State Transducer Technology): Supports ZHFST
    speller archives for various languages.
  - Malaga: Left associative grammar for describing the morphology of
    Finnish language.
  - Experimental backends: Weighted VFST and Lttoolbox.
 .
 Libvoikko provides spell checking, hyphenation, grammar checking and
 morphological analysis for Finnish language. Spell checking is
 supported for other languages through the HFST backend.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
