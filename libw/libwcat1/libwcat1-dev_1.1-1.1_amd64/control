Description: Process monitoring library
 A bug or malicious attacks to machine can lock up a process, leading to a
 deadlock or an unexpected condition. For example: an Apache httpd with
 mod_(php|perl|lua|your_preferred_script_language) running a bad script. When
 the monitored process locks up, the watchcat helps killing him. It is the best
 thing to do.
