Description: Perl port of Webmachine
 Web::Machine provides a RESTful web framework modeled as a state
 machine. You define one or more resource classes. Each resource
 represents a single RESTful URI end point, such as a user, an email,
 etc. The resource class can also be the target for POST requests to
 create a new user, email, etc.
 .
 Each resource is a state machine, and each request for a resource is
 handled by running the request through that state machine.
 .
 Web::Machine is built on top of Plack, but it handles the full request
 and response cycle.
