Description: simple web framework
 Web::Simple provides a bare minimum system for writing web applications that
 don't need a full-fledged web framework.
 .
 The philosophy of Web::Simple is to keep to an absolute bare minimum, for
 everything. It is not designed to be used for large scale applications; the
 Catalyst web framework already works very nicely for that and is a far more
 mature, well supported piece of software.
 .
 However, if you have an application that only does a couple of things, and
 want to not have to think about complexities of deployment, then Web::Simple
 might be just the thing for you.
