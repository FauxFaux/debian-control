Description: Works text file format import filter library (development)
 libwps is a library (for use by word processors, for example) for importing the
 Microsoft Works word processor file format. As of November 2006, the project
 is new, but it imports Works format versions 2, 3, 4, and 8 with some
 formatting. Support for Works formats version 2000 (aka 5) is coming soon.
 .
 This package contains the files needed for developing applications using
 libwps.
