Description: Perl module to fetch webpages with gzip-compression
 The WWW::Mechanize::GZip module tries to fetch a URL by requesting
 gzip-compression from the webserver.
 .
 If the response contains a header with 'Content-Encoding: gzip', it
 decompresses the response in order to get the original (uncompressed)
 content.
 .
 This module will help to reduce bandwidth fetching webpages, if supported
 by the webeserver. If the webserver does not support gzip-compression,
 no compression will be used.
 .
 This modules is a direct subclass of WWW::Mechanize and will therefore
 support any methods provided by WWW::Mechanize.
 .
 The decompression is handled by Compress::Zlib::memGunzip.
