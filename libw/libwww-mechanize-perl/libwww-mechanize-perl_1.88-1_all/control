Description: module to automate interaction with websites
 WWW::Mechanize, or Mech for short, helps you automate interaction with
 a website. It supports performing a sequence of page fetches including
 following links and submitting forms. Each fetched page is parsed and
 its links and forms are extracted. A link or a form can be selected, form
 fields can be filled and the next page can be fetched. Mech also stores
 a history of the URLs you've visited, which can be queried and revisited.
