Description: collection of functions for X11 GUI testing/interaction
 The X11::GUITest module is intended to facilitate the testing of GUI
 applications by means of user emulation. It can be used to test/interact
 with GUI applications; which have been built upon the X library or
 toolkits (i.e., GTK+, Xt, Qt, Motif, etc.) that "wrap" the X
 library's functionality.
