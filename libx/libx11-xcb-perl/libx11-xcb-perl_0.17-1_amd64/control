Description: perl bindings for libxcb
 X11::XCB is a Perl module which wraps libxcb, a library to talk the X11
 protocol.
 .
 Please note that its aim is NOT to provide yet another toolkit for creating
 graphical applications. It is a low-level method of communicating with X11.
 Use cases include testcases for all kinds of X11 applications, implementing
 really simple applications which do not require an graphical toolkit (such as
 GTK+, QT, etc.) or command-line utilities which communicate with X11.
