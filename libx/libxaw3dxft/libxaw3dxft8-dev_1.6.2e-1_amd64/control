Description: Extended version of Xaw3d with support for UTF8 (Development files)
 Xaw3dxft is an extended version of Xaw3d, developed as part of xpaint
 with support for UTF8 input and UTF8 encoding of text, and rendering
 text with the Freetype library and Truetype fonts.
 .
 It should be mostly compatible with the original Xaw3d library,
 except for font management: everything using the old X11 core
 font routines should be replaced by their freetype equivalents.
 .
 This package contains the development files for libxaw3dxft.
