Description: plugin based Java application server (xbean-reflect)
 The goal of XBean project is to created a plugin based server analogous to
 Eclipse being a plugin based IDE. XBean will be able to discover, download and
 install server plugins from an Internet based repository. In addition, it
 include support for multiple IoC systems, support for running with no IoC
 system, JMX without JMX code, lifecycle and class loader management, and a rock
 solid Spring integration.
 .
 This package contains the xbean-reflect module which provides very flexible
 ways to create objects and graphs of objects for DI frameworks.
