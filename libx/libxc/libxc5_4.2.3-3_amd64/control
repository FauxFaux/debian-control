Description: Library of Exchange-Correlation Functionals
 LibXC is a library of exchange-correlation (XC) functionals for
 density-functional theory (DFT). The aim is to provide a portable, well
 tested and reliable set of exchange and correlation functionals that
 can be used by other codes. Supported XC functionals include:
 .
  * Local Density Approximation (LDA) functionals including Slater exchange,
    and VWN, Perdew-Zunger or PADE correlation.
  * Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) XC functionals including PBE,
    PW91, BLYP, HCTH93, HCTH120, HCTH147, HCTH407, as well as B88 exchange and
    LYP or P86 correlation.
  * Hybrid XC functionals including B3LYP, PBE0, B97, X3LYP, BHANDH, HSE03
    and HSE06.
  * Meta-GGA XC functionals including TPSS, M05 and M06.
