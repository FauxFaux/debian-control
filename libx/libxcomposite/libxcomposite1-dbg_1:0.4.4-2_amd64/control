Description: X11 Composite extension library (debug package)
 libXcomposite provides an X Window System client interface to the Composite
 extension to the X protocol.
 .
 The Composite extension allows clients called compositing managers to control
 the final drawing of the screen.  Rendering is done into an off-screen buffer.
 .
 This package contains the debug versions of the library found in
 libxcomposite1. Non-developers likely have little use for this package.
