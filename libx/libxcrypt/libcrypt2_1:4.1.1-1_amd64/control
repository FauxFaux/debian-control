Description: libcrypt shared library
 libxcrypt is a modern library for one-way hashing of passwords.
 It supports DES, MD5, NTHASH, SUNMD5, SHA-2-256, SHA-2-512, and
 bcrypt-based password hashes
 It provides the traditional Unix 'crypt' and 'crypt_r' interfaces,
 as well as a set of extended interfaces like 'crypt_gensalt'.
