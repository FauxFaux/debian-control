Description: HTML interface documentation and examples for libxml++
 Libxml++ is a C++ wrapper for the libxml2 XML parser library (otherwise
 known as the GNOME XML library).  It has SAX and DOM-like APIs, but does not
 attempt to conform exactly to the DOM specification because they are not
 aimed at C++.  Its API is much simpler than the underlying libxml C API.
 .
 This package contains reference documentation and examples.
