Description: Atom Service Document object
 XML::Atom::Service is a Service Document implementation. In the Atom
 Publishing Protocol, a client needs to first discover the capabilities
 and locations of Collections. The Service Document is designed to
 support this discovery process. The document describes the location and
 capabilities of Collections.
 .
 The Atom Publishing Protocol introduces some new XML elements, such as
 app:edited and app:draft, which are imported into XML::Atom. See
 XML::Atom::Atompub in detail.
