Description: Perl module for generation of Atom syndication feeds
 XML::Atom::SimpleFeed provides a minimal API for generating Atom
 syndication feeds quickly and easily. It supports all aspects of the
 Atom format, but has no provisions for generating feeds with
 extension elements.
 .
 You can supply strings for most things, and the module will provide
 useful defaults. When you want more control, you can provide data
 structures, as documented, to specify more particulars.
 .
 This module has a much smaller dependency chain than XML::Atom.
