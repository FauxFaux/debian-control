Description: Perl module to translate between XML and Perl based on XML schemas
 Many (professional) applications process XML messages based on a formal
 specification, expressed in XML Schemas. XML::Compile translates between XML
 and Perl with the help of such schemas. Your Perl program only handles a tree
 of nested HASHes and ARRAYs, and does not need to understand namespaces and
 other general XML and schema nastiness.
