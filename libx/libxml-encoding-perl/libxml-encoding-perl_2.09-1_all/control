Description: Perl module for parsing encoding map XML files
 XML::Encoding, built as a subclass of XML::Parser, parses encoding map
 XML files.  Included in the package is the compile_encoding script
 that compiles these to the binary form used by XML::Parser in order
 to parse scripts in the given encoding.  Also included is a script
 that generates encoding map XML files from the type of mapping files
 obtained at ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS.
 .
 XML::Encoding comes with a set of encoding maps installed in the
 /usr/share/libxml-encoding-perl directory. These are used when building
 the libxml-parser-perl package.
