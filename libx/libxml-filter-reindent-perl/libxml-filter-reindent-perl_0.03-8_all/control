Description: Perl module for reformatting whitespace for pretty printing XML
 XML::Filter::Reindent can be used as a PerlSAX filter to reformat an XML
 document before sending it to a PerlSAX handler that prints it (like
 XML::Handler::Composer).
 .
 Like XML::Filter::DetectWS, it detects ignorable whitespace and
 blocks of whitespace characters in certain places.  It uses this
 information and information supplied by the user to determine where
 whitespace may be modified, deleted or inserted.  Based on the indent
 settings, it then modifies, inserts and deletes characters and
 ignorable_whitespace events accordingly.
 .
 This is just a first stab at the implementation.  It may be buggy and
 may change completely!
 .
 The suggested package is only needed for the example 'pretty.pl'
