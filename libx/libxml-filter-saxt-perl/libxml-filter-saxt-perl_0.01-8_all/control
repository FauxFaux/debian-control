Description: Perl module for replicating events to several event handlers
 The XML::Filter::SAXT module is like the Unix 'tee' command in that it
 multiplexes the input stream to several output streams.  In this case, the
 input stream is a PerlSAX event producer (like XML::Parser::PerlSAX) and
 the output streams are PerlSAX handlers or filters.
 .
 The SAXT constructor takes a list of hash references.  Each hash
 specifies an output handler.  The hash keys can be: DocumentHandler,
 DTDHandler, EntityResolver or Handler, where Handler is a combination
 of the previous three and acts as the default handler.  E.g. if
 DocumentHandler is not specified, it will try to use Handler.
