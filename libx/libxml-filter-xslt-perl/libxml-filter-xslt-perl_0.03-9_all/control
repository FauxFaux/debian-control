Description: Perl module for XSLT as a SAX Filter
 The XML::Filter::XSLT module implements XSLT as a SAX Filter.  At the
 moment it only uses XML::LibXSLT as an XSLT transformer, but hopefully
 others will be supported in the future (it's written with that in mind).
 .
 The beauty is you can stick other things in the transformation chain
 if you want, or you can make the writer use XML::Handler::HTMLWriter
 if you want to write out valid HTML 4.0, or you can make the
 generator something like XML::Generator::DBI.  The possibilities are
 endless.
