Description: transform XML and XHTML to RDF
 GRDDL is a W3C Recommendation for extracting RDF data from arbitrary
 XML and XHTML via a transformation, typically written in XSLT. See
 <http://www.w3.org/TR/grddl/> for more details.
 .
 This module implements GRDDL in Perl. It offers both a low level
 interface, allowing you to generate a list of transformations
 associated with the document being processed, and thus the ability to
 selectively run the transformation; and a high-level interface where a
 single RDF model is returned representing the union of the RDF graphs
 generated by applying all available transformations.
