Description: namespace aware SAX-Parser utility library
 LibXML is a namespace aware SAX-Parser utility library. It eases the
 pain of implementing non-trivial SAX input handlers. The original
 code of these classes had been written by Peter Becker for the
 JCommon library.
 .
 LibXML replaces the JCommon-XML classes, which were not namespace aware.
