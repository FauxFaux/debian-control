Description: Perl implementation of the MiniXML XML generator and parser
 XML::Mini is a set of Perl classes that allow you to access
 XML data and create valid XML output with a tree-based hierarchy of
 elements.
 .
 It provides an easy, object-oriented interface for manipulating XML
 documents and their elements. It is currently being used to send
 requests and understand responses from remote servers in Perl
 applications.
 .
 XML::Mini does not require any external libraries or modules and is pure Perl.
