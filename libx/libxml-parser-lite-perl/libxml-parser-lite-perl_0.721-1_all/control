Description: lightweight regexp-based XML parser
 XML::Parser::Lite implements an XML parser with an interface similar to
 XML::Parser. Though not all callbacks are supported, you should be able to
 use it in the same way you use XML::Parser.
 .
 Note that you cannot use regular expressions or split in callbacks. This is
 due to a limitation of perl's regular expression implementation (which is not
 re-entrant).
