Description: lightweight XML tree builder
 XML::Parser::Lite::Tree is a singleton class for parsing XML into a tree
 structure. It differs from other XML tree generators because it is based on
 XML::Parser::Lite, which is a Pure Perl XML parser. Using this module you can
 tree-ify simple XML without having to compile any C.
