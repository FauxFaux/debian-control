Description: Perl module for easily writing RSS files
 XML::RSS::SimpleGen is a module is for writing RSS files, simply. It
 transparently handles all the unpleasant details of RSS, like proper
 XML escaping, and also has a good number of Do-What-I-Mean features,
 like not changing the modtime on a written-out RSS file if the file
 content hasn't changed, and like automatically removing any HTML tags
 from content you might pass in.
 .
 This module isn't meant to have the full expressive power of RSS;
 instead, it provides functions that are most commonly needed by
 RSS-writing programs.
