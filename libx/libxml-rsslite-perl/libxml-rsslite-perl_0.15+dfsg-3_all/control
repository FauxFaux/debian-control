Description: lightweight, "relaxed" RSS (and XML-ish) parser
 XML::RSSLite attempts to extract the maximum amount of content from
 available documents, and is less concerned with XML compliance than
 alternatives. Rather than rely on XML::Parser, it uses heuristics and good
 old-fashioned Perl regular expressions. It stores the data in a simple
 hash structure, and "aliases" certain tags so that when done, you can
 count on having the minimal data necessary for re-constructing a valid
 RSS file. This means you get the basic title, description, and link for a
 channel and its items.
 .
 This module extracts more usable links by parsing "scriptingNews" and
 "weblog" formats in addition to RDF & RSS. It also "sanitizes" the
 output for best results.
