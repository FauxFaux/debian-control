Description: Perl module collection for managing SAX processors
 XML::SAX::Machines provides a collection of APIs that allow developers to
 build complex Simple API for XML (SAX) machines quickly and minimalistically.
 SAX machines are a way to gather and manage SAX processors. Each machine can
 also be used individually as SAX processors; they do not need to parse or
 write anything.
