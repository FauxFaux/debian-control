Description: Perl module for reading and writing XML
 The XML::Simple module provides a simple API layer on top of an underlying
 XML parsing module to maintain XML files (especially configuration
 files).  Two functions are exported: XMLin() and XMLout().
 .
 The simplest approach is to call these two functions directly, but an
 optional object oriented interface allows them to be called as
 methods of an XML::Simple object.  The object interface can also be
 used at either end of a SAX pipeline.
 .
 Note from upstream: The use of this module in new code is strongly
 discouraged. Other modules are available which provide more straightforward
 and consistent interfaces. In particular, XML::LibXML is highly recommended.
 XML::Twig is another excellent alternative.These modules are packaged as
 libxml-libxml-perl and libxml-twig-perl in Debian.
