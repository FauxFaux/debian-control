Description: Simple oo representation of an XML::LibXML DOM object
 XML::SimpleObject is a short and simple class allowing simple object
 access to a parsed XML::Parser tree, with methods for fetching children
 and attributes in as clean a manner as possible.
 .
 This is a small and quick module, with easy and compact usage. Some
 will rightfully question placing another interface over the DOM methods
 provided by XML::LibXML, but others appreciate the total simplicity
 provided by this module, despite its limitations.
