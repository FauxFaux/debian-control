Description: represent XML as data structure preserving element order
 XML::Struct implements a mapping between XML and Perl data structures.
 By default, the mapping preserves element order, so it also suits for
 "document-oriented" XML.  In short, an XML element is represented as
 array reference with three parts:
 .
   [ $name => \%attributes, \@children ]
 .
 This data structure corresponds to the abstract data model of
 MicroXML <http://www.w3.org/community/microxml/>, a simplified subset
 of XML.
 .
 If your XML documents don't contain relevant attributes, you can also
 choose to map to this format:
 .
   [ $name => \@children ]
 .
 Both parsing (with XML::Struct::Reader or function readXML) and
 serializing (with XML::Struct::Writer or function writeXML) are fully
 based on XML::LibXML, so performance is better than XML::Simple and
 similar to XML::LibXML::Simple.
