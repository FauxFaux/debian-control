Description: Perl module for querying XML tree structures with XQL
 The XML::XQL module implements the XQL (XML Query Language) proposal
 submitted to the XSL Working Group in September 1998.  The spec can
 be found at: http://www.w3.org/TandS/QL/QL98/pp/xql.html.  Most of
 the contents related to the XQL syntax can also be found in the
 XML::XQL::Tutorial that comes with this distribution.  Note that XQL
 is not the same as XML-QL!
 .
 The current implementation only works with the XML::DOM module, but
 once the design is stable and the major bugs are flushed out, other
 extensions might follow, e.g. for XML::Grove.
 .
 XQL was designed to be extensible and this implementation tries to
 stick to that.  Users can add their own functions, methods,
 comparison operators and data types.  Plugging in a new XML tree
 structure (like XML::Grove) should be a piece of cake.
