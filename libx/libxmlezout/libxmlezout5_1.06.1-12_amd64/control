Description: Easy-to-use library for emitting XML from Ada programs, runtime
 XML EZ Out is a small set of packages intended to aid the creation of
 XML-formatted output from within Ada programs. It basically wraps the tags and
 data provided to it with XML syntax and writes them to a user-supplied medium.
 .
 This medium can be any sort of writable entity, such as a file, a
 memory buffer, or even a communications link, such as a socket. The
 only functionality required of the medium is that it supply a
 meaningful "Put" (for writing a string) and "New_Line" procedure.
 .
 This is the runtime library for XML EZ OUT.
