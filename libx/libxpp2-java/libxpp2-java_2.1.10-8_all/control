Description: XML pull parser library for java V2
 Xml Pull Parser (in short XPP) is a streaming pull XML parser for java.
 This version XPP2 is the predecessor of XPP3 (see package libxpp3-java).
 .
 XPP2 consists of two parts: generic API and its implementations. This
 Debian version only provides the default implementation optimized for
 size and speed and is not exposing DTD, entities, comments, or processing
 instructions to the user.
 .
 If you need a xml pull parser implementing the XmlPull API you want to
 have a look at the libxpp3-java package.
