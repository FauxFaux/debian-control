Description: x-ray absorption data for the elements
 Xray::Absorption supports access to X-ray absorption data.  It is designed
 to be a transparent interface to absorption data from a variety of
 sources.  Currently, the only sources of data are the 1969 McMaster
 tables, the 1999 Elam tables, the 1993 Henke tables, and the 1995
 Chantler tables.  The Brennan-Cowen implementation of the
 Cromer-Liberman tables is available as a drop-on-top addition to this
 package.  More resources can be added easily.
