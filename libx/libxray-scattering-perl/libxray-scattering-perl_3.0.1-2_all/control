Description: x-ray scattering data for the elements
 Xray::Scattering supports access to X-ray scattering data for atoms and ions.
 It is designed to be a transparent interface to scattering data from a
 variety of sources.  Currently, the only sources of data are the Cromer-Mann
 tables from the International Tables of Crystallography and the 1995
 Waasmaier-Kirfel tables.  More resources can be added easily.
