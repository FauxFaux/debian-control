Description: Crossroads I/O lightweight messaging layer (shared library)
 Crossroads I/O ("libxs") is a library for building scalable and high
 performance distributed applications. It fits between classic BSD sockets,
 JMS/AMQP-style message queues, and enterprise message-oriented middleware.
 .
 Crossroads I/O extends the standard socket interfaces with features
 traditionally provided by specialised messaging middleware products,
 providing an abstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple messaging
 patterns, message filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to multiple
 transport protocols, and more.
 .
 This package contains the libxs shared library.
