Description: X11 Video extension library (development headers)
 libXv provides an X Window System client interface to the XVideo
 extension to the X protocol.
 .
 The XVideo extension allows for accelerated drawing of videos.  Hardware
 adaptors are exposed to clients, which may draw in a number of colourspaces,
 including YUV.
 .
 This package contains the development headers for the library found in
 libxv1.  Non-developers likely have little use for this package.
