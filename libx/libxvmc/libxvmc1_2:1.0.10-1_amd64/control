Description: X11 Video extension library
 libXvMC provides an X Window System client interface to the
 XVideo-MotionCompensation extension to the X protocol.
 .
 The XVideo-MotionCompensation extension allows for further accelerated drawing
 of videos.  Video data may be sent at earlier stages of the decoding pipeline
 than raw YUV data.  At the moment, driver support for XvMC is poor to
 non-existent.
