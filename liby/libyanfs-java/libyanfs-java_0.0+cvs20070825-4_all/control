Description: Yet Another NFS - a Java NFS library
 This project represents a Java implementation of the XDR, RPC, NFSv2,
 and NFSv3 protocols in client side form.
 .
 WebNFS was the original name for this implementation but the name has
 changed to reflect the expanded scope of the project to include a
 server side implementation.
