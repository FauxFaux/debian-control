Description: parser toolkit for IETF YANG data modeling - development files
 Libyang implements functions to process schemas expressed in the
 YANG data modeling language defined by the IETF in RFCs 6020/7950.
 Schemas expressed in this language primarily describe configuration
 used by larger network equipment like routers and switches.
 .
 In addition to handling the schemas itself, the library also provides
 functions to process data described by the schemas.
 .
 This package contains the C headers, a pkgconfig file, and .so entry point
 for libyang.
