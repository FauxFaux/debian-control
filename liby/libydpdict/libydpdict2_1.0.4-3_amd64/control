Description: library for reading Collins dictionaries
 This library makes it easy for a program to read the dictionaries distributed
 by Young Digital Planet (English-Polish/Polish-English and/or
 German-Polish/Polish-German).
 .
 This package only contains the library, it does not contain the dictionary
 files. To use it, you need a copy of the dictionary from YDP and a program
 which can use this library (e.g. ydpdict).
