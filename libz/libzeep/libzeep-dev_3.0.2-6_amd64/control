 implementation, XPath 1.0 support and code to create SOAP/REST servers as
 well as a full web application framework.

 libzeep was originally designed to create SOAP servers in C++ easily. The
 current incarnation provides a full validating XML parser creating a DOM tree
 that can be iterated using STL container like methods. The tree can be searched
 using XPath 1.0 queries.
