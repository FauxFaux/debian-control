Description: Library files for libzeep
 Libzeep is a C++ library providing a validating XML parser, XML DOM tree
 implementation, XPath 1.0 support and code to create SOAP/REST servers as
 well as a full web application framework.
 .
 libzeep was originally designed to create SOAP servers in C++ easily. The
 current incarnation provides a full validating XML parser creating a DOM tree
 that can be iterated using STL container like methods. The tree can be searched
 using XPath 1.0 queries.
 .
 There's also code to create SOAP and REST servers based allowing to export
 C++ methods as web services. And there's a full web application framework to
 create dynamic web sites in C++ and XHTML.
 .
 This package contains the shared library only.
