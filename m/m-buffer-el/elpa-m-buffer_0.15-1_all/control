Description: list-oriented, functional buffer manipulation
 This package provides a set of list-oriented functions for operating
 over the contents of buffers, mostly revolving around regexp
 searching, and regions. They avoid the use of looping, manipulating
 global state with `match-data'. Many high-level functions exist for
 matching sentences, lines and so on.
