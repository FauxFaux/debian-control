Description: printer driver for Minolta magicolor 2300W/2400W color laser printers
 The m2300w driver is a driver for the Konica Minolta magicolor 2300W and
 2400W color laser printers.
 .
 The driver is basically intended for being used in conjunction with
 "foomatic" (see http://www.openprinting.org/foomatic.html), which
 is a database-driven system for integrating free software printer
 drivers with common spoolers under Unix, like CUPS, LPRng, LPD,
 GNUlpr, PPR, PDQ, CPS, and direct printing.
