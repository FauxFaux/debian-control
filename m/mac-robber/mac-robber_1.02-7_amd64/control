Description: collects data about allocated files in mounted filesystems
 mac-robber is a digital investigation tool (digital forensics) that collects
 metadata from allocated files in a mounted filesystem. This is useful during
 incident response when analyzing a live system or when analyzing a dead
 system in a lab. The data can be used by the mactime tool in The Sleuth Kit
 (TSK or SleuthKit only) to make a timeline of file activity. The mac-robber
 tool is based on the grave-robber tool from TCT (The Coroners Toolkit).
 .
 mac-robber requires that the filesystem be mounted by the operating system,
 unlike the tools in The Sleuth Kit that process the filesystem themselves.
 Therefore, mac-robber will not collect data from deleted files or files that
 have been hidden by rootkits. mac-robber will also modify the Access times
 on directories that are mounted with write permissions.
 .
 mac-robber is useful when dealing with a filesystem that is not supported
 by The Sleuth Kit or other filesystem analysis tools. You can run mac-robber
 on an obscure, suspect UNIX filesystem that has been mounted read-only on a
 trusted system.
