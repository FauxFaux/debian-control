Description: utility for manipulating the MAC address of network interfaces
 GNU MAC Changer is an utility that makes the maniputation of MAC addresses of
 network interfaces easier.  MAC addresses are unique identifiers on networks,
 they only need to be unique, they can be changed on most network hardware.
 MAC addresses have started to be abused by unscrupulous marketing firms,
 government agencies, and others to provide an easy way to track a computer
 across multiple networks.  By changing the MAC address regularly, this kind
 of tracking can be thwarted, or at least made a lot more difficult.
