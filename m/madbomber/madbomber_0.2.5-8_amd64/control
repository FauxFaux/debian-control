Description: Kaboom! clone
 "Mad Bomber" is a clone of Activision's classic Atari 2600 console
 game, "Kaboom!," by Larry Kaplan, with spruced-up graphics and
 sound effects, and music.
 .
 The Mad Bomber is loose in the city and he's dropping bombs everywhere!
 It's your job to catch them before they hit the ground and explode.
 Luckily, you have a set of trusty buckets to extinguish the bombs with.
