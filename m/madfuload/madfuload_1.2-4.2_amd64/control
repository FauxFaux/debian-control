Description: Firmware loader for M-Audio DFU audio devices
 This package allows you to use M-Audio's DFU audio devices
 with Linux. These devices require a firmware download before
 an operating system driver (e.g. ALSA's snd-usb-audio) can
 access them.
 .
 Supported devices:
  - Sonica
  - Ozone
  - MobilePre USB (some newer models work without the loader)
  - Transit
 The loader is not required for some newer models of the above devices,
 like the Ozone Academic.
