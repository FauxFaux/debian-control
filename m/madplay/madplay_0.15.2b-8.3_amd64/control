Description: MPEG audio player in fixed point
 MAD is an MPEG audio decoder. It currently only supports the MPEG 1
 standard, but fully implements all three audio layers (Layer I, Layer II,
 and Layer III, the latter often colloquially known as MP3.).  There is also
 full support for ID3 tags.
 .
 All work is done in fixed point, so it even works on machines without an FPU.
