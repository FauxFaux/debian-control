Description: Multiple alignment program for amino acid or nucleotide sequences
 MAFFT is a multiple sequence alignment program which offers three
 accuracy-oriented methods:
  * L-INS-i (probably most accurate; recommended for <200 sequences;
    iterative refinement method incorporating local pairwise alignment
    information),
  * G-INS-i (suitable for sequences of similar lengths; recommended for
    <200 sequences; iterative refinement method incorporating global
    pairwise alignment information),
  * E-INS-i (suitable for sequences containing large unalignable regions;
    recommended for <200 sequences),
 and five speed-oriented methods:
  * FFT-NS-i (iterative refinement method; two cycles only),
  * FFT-NS-i (iterative refinement method; max. 1000 iterations),
  * FFT-NS-2 (fast; progressive method),
  * FFT-NS-1 (very fast; recommended for >2000 sequences; progressive
    method with a rough guide tree),
  * NW-NS-PartTree-1 (recommended for âˆ¼50,000 sequences; progressive
    method with the PartTree algorithm).
