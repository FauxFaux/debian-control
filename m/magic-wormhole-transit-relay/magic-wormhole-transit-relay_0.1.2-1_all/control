Description: Transit Relay server for Magic-Wormhole
 This repository implements the Magic-Wormhole "Transit Relay", a
 server that helps clients establish bulk-data transit connections
 even when both are behind NAT boxes. Each side makes a TCP connection
 to this server and presents a handshake. Two connections with
 identical handshakes are glued together, allowing them to pretend
 they have a direct connection.
 .
 This server used to be included in the magic-wormhole repository, but
 was split out into a separate repo to aid deployment and development.
