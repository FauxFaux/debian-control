Description: Securely and simply transfer data between computers
 Magic Wormhole provides a command-line tool and Python library named
 "wormhole" which makes it possible to very easily transfer short
 pieces of text or arbitrary-sized files or directories from one
 computer to another.
 .
 The two endpoints are identified by using identical "wormhole codes":
 in general, the sending machine generates and displays the code,
 which must then be typed into the receiving machine.  The codes are
 short and human-pronounceable, using a phonetically-distinct
 wordlist.  The receiving side offers tab-completion on the codewords,
 so usually only a few characters must be typed.  Wormhole codes are
 single-use and do not need to be memorized.
