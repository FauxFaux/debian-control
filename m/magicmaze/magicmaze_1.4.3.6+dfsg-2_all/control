Description: rescue the maiden while avoiding the monsters
 This is a simple game where you are a wizard searching the evil demon's
 tower to try and rescue the beautiful maiden.  Inspired by Gauntlet II,
 your goal is to avoid/kill the monsters while trying to find the exit
 and, eventually, the big boss who is holding your girlfriend captive.
 Includes support for playing in full-screen and with a joystick.
