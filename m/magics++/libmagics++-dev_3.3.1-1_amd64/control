Description: Development files for ECMWF  plotting software MAGICS++
 Magics++ is the latest generation of the ECMWF's Meteorological plotting
 software MAGICS. Although completely redesigned in C++, it is intended to be
 as backwards-compatible as possible with the Fortran interface.
 Besides its programming interfaces (Fortran and C), Magics++ offers MagML,
 a plot description language based on XML aimed at automatic web production.
 .
 This package includes the header files and static libraries needed to build
 against libmagics++.
