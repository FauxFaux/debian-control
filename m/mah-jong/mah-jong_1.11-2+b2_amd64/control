Description: Original Mah-Jong game
 This is a set of programs to play the original Mah-Jong game: one
 server, one client for a human player and one client for an AI
 player. Hence the game can be played by 1 to 4 human players.
 .
 You should keep in mind that the original Mah-Jong game has nothing
 to do with the well-known solitaire game. (It merely uses the same
 set of tiles.)
