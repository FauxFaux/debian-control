Description: network traces for the mahimahi toolkit
 These trace files represent the time-varying capacity of U.S. cellular
 networks as experienced by a mobile user. They were recorded using the
 "Saturator" tool described in the research paper:
 .
 K. Winstein, A. Sivaraman, and H. Balakrishnan, "Stochastic Forecasts
 Achieve High Throughput and Low Delay over Cellular Networks", USENIX
 NSDI 2013.
 .
 The traces can be played back by the mm-link network emulator,
 part of the mahimahi toolkit.
