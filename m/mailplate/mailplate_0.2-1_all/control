Description: reformat mail drafts according to templates
 mailplate addresses the problem of having multiple mail identities, each
 with a different template for composing mail messages, and the need to
 switch between them after starting to write. It can process mail drafts and
 switch the underlying template and can thus be used from within the editor
 to switch the identity used to write the current mail message.
 .
 It can also be used as a wrapper of your editor and invoked directly from
 your mail user agent. Its ability to automatically select a template
 according to a nifty scoring system based makes it the ideal companion for
 those who use mail on a daily basis.
