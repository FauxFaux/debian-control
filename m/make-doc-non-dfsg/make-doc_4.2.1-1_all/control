Description: Documentation for the GNU version of the "make" utility
 This package contains the documentation for GNU Make.  The upstream
 sources for this package are available at the location
 ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/. This package has been stripped down to
 only contain the documentation; since the documentation is covered
 under a non-free license and thus has been moved to
 non-free/doc. Make itself remains in Debian.
