Description: creates device files in /dev
 The MAKEDEV executable is used to create device files, often in /dev.
 .
 Device files are special files through which applications can interact
 with hardware.
 .
 This package is not necessary for most modern Linux systems, where the udev
 subsystem provides a more dynamic mechanism for device file management.
