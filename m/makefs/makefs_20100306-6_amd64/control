Description: create a cd9660 or ffs file system image from a directory tree
 NetBSDÂ® makefs(8) creates a file system image from a directory tree
 without the need for superuser privileges. The MirBSD version fixes
 ECMA 119, SUSP and RRIP (Rock Ridge) compliance and adds features.
 .
 Supported target filesystem types are:
 .
    cd9660   ISO 9660 (ECMA 119) compatible filesystem images, with
             Rock Ridge, El Torito, and other features
    ffs      4.2FFS, the BSD Fast Filesystem, also known as UFS1;
             UFS2 (with "-o version=2")
 .
 The images created can be of a fixed (predefined) size, given on the
 command line, or sized automatically. Permission bits are taken from
 the source directory tree but may be overridden using an mtree file.
 .
 This utility does not currently support Large Files (2 GiB or more).
