Description: Italian version of the manual pages
 This package contains the manual pages (all sections) translated into
 Italian. Translation is (continuously) in progress, and we try to
 keep in sync English and Italian versions as much as possible. Anyway
 sometimes Italian pages happen to be outdated; in these cases you need
 to refer to the original English ones.
