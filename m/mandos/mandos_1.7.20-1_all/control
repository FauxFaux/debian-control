Description: server giving encrypted passwords to Mandos clients
 This is the server part of the Mandos system, which allows
 computers to have encrypted root file systems and at the
 same time be capable of remote and/or unattended reboots.
 .
 The computers run a small client program in the initial RAM
 disk environment which will communicate with a server over a
 network.  All network communication is encrypted using TLS.
 The clients are identified by the server using an OpenPGP
 key; each client has one unique to it.  The server sends the
 clients an encrypted password.  The encrypted password is
 decrypted by the clients using the same OpenPGP key, and the
 password is then used to unlock the root file system,
 whereupon the computers can continue booting normally.
