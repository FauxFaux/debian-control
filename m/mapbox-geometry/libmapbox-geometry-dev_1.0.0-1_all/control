Description: Generic C++ interfaces for geometry types, collections, and features
 geometry.hpp provides header-only, generic C++ interfaces for geometry
 types, geometry collections, and features.

 These types are designed to be easy to parse and serialize to GeoJSON.
 .
 They should also be a robust and high performance container for data
 processing and conversion.
