Description: Convert geo coordinates to/from mapcodes
 A mapcode represents a location. Every location on Earth can be
 represented by a mapcode. Mapcodes were designed to be short, easy to
 recognise, remember and communicate. They are precise to a few meters,
 which is good enough for every-day use. Locations in densely populated
 areas often get shorter mapcodes. See http://www.mapcode.com/
 .
 This package contains a command line utility that can convert to and
 from mapcodes.
