Description: Photo viewer and organizer with emphasis on IPTC fields
 Cross-platform (UNIX, Mac OS X, and Windows) picture manager and organizer,
 Mapivi is a stand alone tool, there is no need for a web server, online
 access or a database.
 .
 Deals with EXIF data (like timestamp, camera model, focal length, exposure
 time, aperture, etc.), and is able to rename the pictures according to their
 internal date/time, to display and modify JPEG comments and to do lossless
 rotation.
 .
 The idea of using Mapivi as an picture organizer is to keep user, EXIF, and
 IPTC information where it belongs -- in the pictures -- as well in a
 searchable Mapivi database.
 .
 Mapivi is also able to do image processing. Mapivi serves here as a
 frontend (GUI) for many proven command line tools, like the Image Magick
 tools.
