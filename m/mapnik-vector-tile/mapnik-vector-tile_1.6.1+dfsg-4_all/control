Description: Vector tiles integration with mapnik - development files
 This package provides C++ header and source needed to render geodata
 into vector tiles, and vector tiles into images.
 .
 Tiles are encoded as protobuf messages, and that geodata format can be
 used as a drop-in replacement for mapnik datasources like postgis and
 shapefiles, without compromising on speed.
 .
 Mapnik is a C++/Python toolkit for developing GIS applications.
