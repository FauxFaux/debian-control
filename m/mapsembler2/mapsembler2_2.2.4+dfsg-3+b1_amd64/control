Description: bioinformatics targeted assembly software
 Mapsembler2 is a targeted assembly software.
 It takes as input a set of NGS raw reads (fasta or fastq, gzipped or not)
 and a set of input sequences (starters).
 .
 It first determines if each starter is read-coherent, e.g. whether reads
 confirm the presence of each starter in the original sequence.
 Then for each read-coherent starter, Mapsembler2 outputs its sequence
 neighborhood as a linear sequence or as a graph, depending on the user choice.
 .
 Mapsembler2 may be used for (not limited to):
  - Validate an assembled sequence (input as starter), e.g. from a de
    Bruijn graph assembly where read-coherence was not enforced.
  - Checks if a gene (input as starter) has an homolog in a set of reads
  - Checks if a known enzyme is present in a metagenomic NGS read set.
  - Enrich unmappable reads by extending them, possibly making them mappable
  - Checks what happens at the extremities of a contig
  - Remove contaminants or symbiont reads from a read set
