Description: upload/download maps to/from a VALVe game server (Server)
 Uploading Maps to a Game server can be a tedious process if you want to get
 the post-upload processing right. MapTransfer tries to automate this process
 as much as possible. It handles everything a map upload takes:
 .
  * Automatically BZip compresses uploaded maps if the client didn't.
  * Hardlinks files if more than one gameserver path is specified in the config.
    That way a single map is uploaded to multiple servers at once (and only
    takes up the space once, too).
  * Saves you and your users a lot of tedious cdery and copypasta.
 .
  Aside from the core functionality, it offers a few niceties as well:
 .
  * Uses HTTPS as protocol - that way, you can download maps (or test
    connectivity) with your favorite web browser, or write your own scripts
    that interact with the server.
  * IPv6 ready
  * Extensible: Any game should work, as long as it uses bsp maps - map
    directories aren't hard coded but read from the config file.
