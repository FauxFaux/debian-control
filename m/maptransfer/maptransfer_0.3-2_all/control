Description: upload/download maps to/from a VALVe game server (Client)
 Uploading Maps to a Game server can be a tedious process if you want to get
 the post-upload processing right. MapTransfer tries to automate this process
 as much as possible. It handles everything a map upload takes:
 .
  * Finds the paths on the disk where Steam is installed and where games are
    located. (Uses the Registry on Windows, and maptransfer.cfg for other OSs)
  * BZips the Map before upload, and only uploads the BZ2ed file. That way,
    maps are automatically prepared for fast download, while saving (mega)bytes
    for the client to upload.
  * Uploads .nav/.txt/.res files, if any.
  * Hardlinks files on the server side, if more than one gameserver path is
    specified in the config; that way a single map is uploaded to multiple
    servers at once (and only takes up the space once, too).
  * Saves you and your users a lot of tedious cdery and copypasta.
  * Highlights the maps you or the server don't have, so you easily see what's
    missing on either side.
 .
 Aside from the core functionality, it offers a few niceties as well:
 .
  * Client allows for simultaneous downloads and uploads.
  * Uses HTTPS as protocol - that way, you can download maps (or test
    connectivity) with your favorite web browser, or write your own scripts
    that interact with the server.
  * IPv6 ready
  * Extensible: Any game should work, as long as it uses bsp maps - map
    directories aren't hard coded but read from the config file.
