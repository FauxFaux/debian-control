Description: logging daemonizer
 The duende program starts a child process as specified on the command
 line and handles some aspects of maintaining it as a daemon process.
 In particular it passes the standard output and error from the child
 process to syslog. If the child process exits with a configurable exit
 status it will be restarted. Optionally duende will provide a pid file,
 and other features are configurable.
