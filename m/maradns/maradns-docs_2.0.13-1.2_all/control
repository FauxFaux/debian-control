Description: upstream documentation for the MaraDNS Domain Name Service server
 MaraDNS is easy to configure DNS server that functions as a recursive and/or
 authoritative name server. This package provides the upstream documentation
 for the MaraDNS suite. This includes more information than is available in the
 man pages including background information on DNS, how to obtain the source
 code, compile and install it. As a result the documentation includes none of
 the packaging tweaks intended to fit MaraDNS into Debian.
