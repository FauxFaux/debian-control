Description: complementary server process to TCP functions for MaraDNS
 The MaraDNS zoneserver listens on port 53/tcp and handles DNS zone transfers
 and any DNS query done over TCP instead of UDP. It uses the same configuration
 file as the MaraDNS process itself.
 .
 This package also includes askmara-tcp, a version of askmara that uses TCP
 rather than UDP.
