Description: simple security-focused authoritative Domain Name Service server
 MaraDNS is an easy to configure DNS server that functions as an
 authoritative domain name server. MaraDNS is
 optimised for serving a small number of domains quickly and
 efficiently. Well suited to host your own private DNS server
 for making up subdomains with minimal fuss. Maradns is
 security-aware by utilising a special string library which
 is resistant to buffer overflows and mandating to run as an
 unprivileged user.
 .
 For the recursive name server component and IPv6 support see
 maradns-deadwood. For TCP and domain transfer support see maradns-zoneserver.
