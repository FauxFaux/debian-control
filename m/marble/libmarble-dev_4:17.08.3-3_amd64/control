Description: development files for the Marble globe widget library
 Marble is a generic geographical map widget and framework for KDE
 applications. The Marble widget shows the earth as a sphere but does not
 require hardware acceleration.  A minimal set of geographical data is
 included, so it can be used without an internet connection.
 .
 This package contains development files for building software that uses the
 Marble globe widget library.
 .
 This package is part of the KDE education module.
