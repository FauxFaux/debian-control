Description: reachability analyzer for Algebraic System Nets
 Maria is a powerful tool designed to aid engineers in modelling and
 solving concurrency related problems in parallel and distributed
 computing systems.
 .
 Maria finds deadlocks and violations against safety or liveness
 requirements by exploring all states that can be reached from the
 initial state of a system.  The tool manages tens or hundreds of
 millions of reachable states and enabled actions.
 .
 The expressive power of Maria's formalism is close to high-level
 programming languages, thanks to its rich data type system and
 powerful algebraic operations.
