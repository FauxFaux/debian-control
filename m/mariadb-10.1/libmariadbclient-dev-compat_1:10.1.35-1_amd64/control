Description: MariaDB database development files (libmysqlclient compatibility)
 MariaDB is a fast, stable and true multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database
 server. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most popular database query
 language in the world. The main goals of MariaDB are speed, robustness and
 ease of use.
 .
 This package provides a version of libmysqlclient.so to allow
 packages to link using -lmysqlclient but end up with a link against
 libmariadbclient instead. This allows packages designed for
 MySQL to link against MariaDB's client library instead, while still permitting
 MySQL's client library to co-exist on users' systems.
