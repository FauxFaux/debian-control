Description: MariaDB database development files

 server. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most popular database query
 language in the world. The main goals of MariaDB are speed, robustness and
 ease of use.
 .
 This package includes development libraries and header files. To allow sources
 expecting the MariaDB Connector/C to build. Sources that expect the MySQL
 Client libraries should use files from the libmariadb-dev-compat package.
