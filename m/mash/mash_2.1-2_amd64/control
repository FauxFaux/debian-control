Description: fast genome and metagenome distance estimation using MinHash
 Mash uses MinHash locality-sensitive hashing to reduce large biosequences to
 a representative sketch and rapidly estimate pairwise distances between
 genomes or metagenomes. Mash sketch databases effectively delineate known
 species boundaries, allow construction of approximate phylogenies, and can be
 searched in seconds using assembled genomes or raw sequencing runs from
 Illumina, Pacific Biosciences, and Oxford Nanopore.
 For metagenomics, Mash scales to thousands of samples and can replicate Human
 Microbiome Project and Global Ocean Survey results in a fraction of the time.
