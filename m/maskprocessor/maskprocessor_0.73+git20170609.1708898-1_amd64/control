Description: high-performance word generator with a per-position configurable charset
 Maskprocessor is a fast word list generator. It enumerates all combinations
 from a given user-defined keyspace and outputs the results. Since it supports
 different alphabets (which also can be combined) at different positions in the
 generation template ('mask'), this approach allows a more fine-tunable
 generation of candidates than using 'naive' brute force enumeration of words.
 Masks are defined using the description also used in the Hashcat password
 recovery utility.
