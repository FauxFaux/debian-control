Description: GObject introspection data for the libmate-desktop library
 The MATE component mate-desktop contains the libmate-desktop library, the
 mate-about program, as well as some desktop-wide documents.
 .
 The libmate-desktop library provides an API shared by several applications
 on the desktop, but that cannot live in the platform for various
 reasons.
 .
 This package contains introspection data for the library.
 .
 It can be used by packages using the GIRepository format to generate
 dynamic bindings.
