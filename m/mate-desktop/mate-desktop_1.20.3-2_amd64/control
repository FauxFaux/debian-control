Description: Library with common API for various MATE modules
 The MATE component mate-desktop contains the libmate-desktop library, the
 mate-about program, as well as some desktop-wide documents.
 .
 The libmate-desktop library provides an API shared by several applications
 on the desktop, but that cannot live in the platform for various
 reasons.
 .
 The mate-about program helps with finding which version of MATE is installed.
 .
 NOTE: This package does not install the complete MATE desktop environment
 for you. The full desktop environment can be installed via the metapackage
 mate-desktop-environment.
