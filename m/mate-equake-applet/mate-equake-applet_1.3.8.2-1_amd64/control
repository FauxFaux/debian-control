Description: Mate panel applet which monitors earthquakes
 mate-equake-plugin is a panel applet for the mate panel which monitors
 earthquakes and displays an update each time a new earthquake occurs.

 display maps and webpages with more information, produce lists
 of hourly and daily earthquakes and update a handy signature file you
