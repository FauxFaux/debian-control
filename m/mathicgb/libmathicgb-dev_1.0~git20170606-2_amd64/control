Description: Compute Groebner bases (developer tools)
 Mathicgb is a program for computing Groebner basis and signature Groebner
 bases.  Mathicgb is based on the fast data structures from mathic.
 .
 The paper "Practical Groebner Basis Computation" describes the algorithms in
 Mathicgb from a high level. It was presented at ISSAC 2012 and is available at
 http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6940
 .
 This package contains the developer tools.
