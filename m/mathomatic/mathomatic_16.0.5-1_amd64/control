Description: portable Computer Algebra System (CAS)
 Mathomatic implements most of the rules of algebra for the
 mathematical operators +, -, *, /, % (modulus), and power (including
 roots).
 .
 Mathomatic can symbolically:
 .
  * combine and solve equations,
  * completely simplify and compare expressions and equations,
  * do simple calculus transformations and series,
  * do standard, complex number, modular, and polynomial arithmetic,
  * generate optimized C, Java, and Python language code from
    simplified equations,
  * plot expressions with gnuplot in two or three dimensions,
  * do quick calculations, colorize expressions, etc.
