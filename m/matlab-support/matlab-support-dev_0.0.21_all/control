Description: helpers for packages building MATLAB toolboxes
 This package provides a Makefile snippet (analogous to the one used for
 Octave) that configures the locations for architecture independent M-files,
 binary MEX-extensions, and their corresponding sources. This package can be
 used as a build-dependency by other packages shipping MATLAB toolboxes.
