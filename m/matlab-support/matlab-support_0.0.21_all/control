Description: distro integration for local MATLAB installations
 This package does not provide MATLAB. Instead, it configures an
 existing MATLAB installation to integrate more comfortably in
 a Debian installation.
 .
 Currently it provides /usr/bin/matlab through the alternatives
 system, offers to work around incompatibilities between the libraries
 bundled with MATLAB and system libraries, and provides a helper
 utility meant to be used by other packages to compile MEX extensions.
 .
 Install this if you would like your MATLAB installation to behave more
 like an ordinary Debian package. Other packages may depend on
 this one if they install MATLAB code, for example in order to
 compile MEX extensions.
