Description: LDAP auth provider for the Matrix homeserver
 Synapse is the reference Python/Twisted Matrix homeserver implementation.
 .
 Synapse is intended to showcase the concept of Matrix, and to let users run
 their own homeserver and generally help bootstrap the ecosystem.
 .
 Matrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time
 communication over IP. It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC
 signalling, Internet of Things communication or anywhere where's a need for
 a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the
 conversation history.
 .
 In Matrix, every user runs one or more Matrix clients, which connect through
 to a Matrix homeserver. The homeserver stores all their personal chat history
 and user account information, much as a mail client connects through to an
 IMAP/SMTP server.
 .
 This package allows synapse to use LDAP for authentication as opposed
 to usual authentication via registering using a matrix client.
