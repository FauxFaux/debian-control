Description: high-performance logical framework
 Maude is a high-performance reflective language and system supporting
 both equational and rewriting logic specification and programming for
 a wide range of applications. Maude has been influenced in important
 ways by the OBJ3 language, which can be regarded as an equational
 logic sublanguage. Besides supporting equational specification and
 programming, Maude also supports rewriting logic computation.
 .
 Rewriting logic is a logic of concurrent change that can naturally
 deal with state and with concurrent computations. It has good
 properties as a general semantic framework for giving executable
 semantics to a wide range of languages and models of concurrency. In
 particular, it supports very well concurrent object-oriented
 computation. The same reasons making rewriting logic a good semantic
 framework make it also a good logical framework, that is, a metalogic
 in which many other logics can be naturally represented and executed.
 .
 Maude supports in a systematic and efficient way logical
 reflection. This makes Maude remarkably extensible and powerful,
 supports an extensible algebra of module composition operations, and
 allows many advanced metaprogramming and metalanguage
 applications. Indeed, some of the most interesting applications of
 Maude are metalanguage applications, in which Maude is used to create
 executable environments for different logics, theorem provers,
 languages, and models of computation.
 .
 Maude is of interest to the biomedical community for modeling and
 analysis of biological systems.
