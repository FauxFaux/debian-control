Description: free test suite for the Java Class libraries
 Mauve is intended to test several different varieties of the
 libraries.  For instance, it will contain tests that are specific to
 a particular JDK version.  Tags in the test files help the test
 framework decide which tests should or should not be run against a
 given runtime.
