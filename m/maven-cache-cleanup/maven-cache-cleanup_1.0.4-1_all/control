Description: Utility to purge timestamped snapshots from Maven repositories
 Maven 3 dropped support for non-unique snapshot versions, which had the
 side effect of filling up Maven caches on developer machines and on CI
 build hosts. The Maven Cache Cleanup utility scans a specified Maven cache
 directory for snapshot versions and deletes all but the latest version of
 the timestamped artifacts.
