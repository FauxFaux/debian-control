Description: Maven plugin to replace tokens in a given file with a value
 This plugin is typically used to change database or network configuration
 within a project during a maven build. It also can perform some advanced text
 replacement functions, such as providing a separate token/value file to keep
 your build script concise, writing resulting text after replacement to a
 separate file and token matching with regular expressions. There is even
 support for making exact document node replacements via X-Path.
