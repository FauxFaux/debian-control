Description: Maven Source Plugin
 The Maven 2 Source Plugin creates a JAR archive of the source files of
 the current project. The Source Plugin has five goals:
  * source:aggregate aggregrates sources for all modules in an aggregator
    project.
  * source:jar is used to bundle the main sources of the project into a
    jar archive.
  * source:test-jar on the other hand, is used to bundle the test sources
    of the project into a jar archive.
  * source:jar-no-fork is similar to jar but does not fork the build lifecycle.
  * source:test-jar-no-fork is similar to test-jar but does not fork the
    build lifecycle.
