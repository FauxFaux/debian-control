Description: Apache Mavibot - MVCC BTree Java Implementation
 Mavibot is a Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) BTree in Java.
 It is expected to be a replacement for JDBM (The current backend for
 the Apache Directory Server), but could be a good fit for any other
 project in need of a Java MVCC BTree implementation.
