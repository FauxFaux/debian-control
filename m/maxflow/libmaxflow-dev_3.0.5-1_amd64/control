Description: Development files for the maxflow-mincut algorithm
 This library implements an efficient minimum cut/maximum flow
 algorithms on graphs that can be used for exact or approximate
 energy minimization in low-level vision. The algorithm provides a high
 performance that makes near real-time performance possible.
 This package provides the development files for the library.
