Description: control filesystem modifications before they occur
 maybe runs processes under the control of ptrace. When it intercepts
 a system call that is about to make changes to the file system, it
 logs that call, ignores the system call and indicates success to the
 calling process.
 .
 After execution, maybe produces a report of all attempted changes to
 the filesystem, and offers to re-run the process (without filtering
 this time).
