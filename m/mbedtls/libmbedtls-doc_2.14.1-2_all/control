Description: lightweight crypto and SSL/TLS library - documentation
 mbed TLS (formerly known as PolarSSL) is a lean open source crypto library for
 providing SSL and TLS support in your programs. It offers an intuitive API and
 documented header files, so you can actually understand what the code does.
 It features:
  - Symmetric algorithms, like AES, Blowfish, Triple-DES, DES, ARC4, Camellia
    and XTEA
  - Hash algorithms, like SHA-1, SHA-2, RIPEMD-160 and MD5
  - Entropy pool and random generators, like CTR-DRBG and HMAC-DRBG
  - Public key algorithms, like RSA, Elliptic Curves, Diffie-Hellman, ECDSA
    and ECDH
  - TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2
  - Abstraction layers for ciphers, hashes, public key operations, platform
    abstraction and threading
 .
 This package contains the API documentation.
