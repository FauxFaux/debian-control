Description: memory-based tagger-generator and tagger - runtime
 MBT is a memory-based tagger-generator and tagger in one. The tagger-generator
 part can generate a sequence tagger on the basis of a training set of tagged
 sequences; the tagger part can tag new sequences. MBT can, for instance, be
 used to generate part-of-speech taggers or chunkers for natural language
 processing.
 .
 MBT is a product of the Centre of Language and Speech Technology (Radboud
 University Nijmegen, The Netherlands), the ILK Research Group (Tilburg
 University, The Netherlands) and the CLiPS Research Centre (University
 of Antwerp, Belgium).
 .
 If you do scientific research in natural language processing, MBT will
 likely be of use to you.
 .
 This package provides the runtime files required to run programs that use
 libmbt.
