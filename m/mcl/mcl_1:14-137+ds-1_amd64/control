Description: Markov Cluster algorithm
 The MCL package is an implementation of the MCL algorithm, and offers
 utilities for manipulating sparse matrices (the essential data
 structure in the MCL algorithm) and conducting cluster experiments.
 .
 MCL is currently being used in sciences like biology (protein family
 detection, genomics), computer science (node clustering in
 Peer-to-Peer networks), and linguistics (text analysis).
