Description: CERNLIB Monte Carlo libraries
 CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for
 use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other
 fields such as the biological sciences.
 .
 This metapackage provides various Monte Carlo libraries included in CERNLIB
 (both shared and static).  Likely only physicists will be interested in
 these packages.  Note that the GEANT 3.21 framework is not included, but it
 may be obtained by also installing the geant321 Debian package.
 .
 Be aware that the libraries of Ariadne, Fritiof, Jetset, Lepto, and Pythia are
 not available within Debian due to licensing issues; see the README.Debian
 file in the montecarlo-base package for information on obtaining them.
