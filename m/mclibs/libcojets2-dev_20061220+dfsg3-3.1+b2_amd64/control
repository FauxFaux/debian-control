Description: [Physics] COJETS p-p and pbar-p interaction Monte Carlo
 COJETS is a Monte Carlo library which simulates pbar-p and p-p interactions at
 high energy.  The interaction process is first calculated at the parton level
 by means of perturbative QCD and the Weinberg-Salam model for electroweak
 interactions.  Partons are then independently fragmented into jets of hadrons,
 according to the Field-Feynman model, and the beam jets contribution is
 added, according to a longitudinal phase-space model.  Multiple QCD radiation
 of initial and final partons is included.
 .
 This is the static version of the library.  The package also includes
 FORTRAN header files and documentation for COJETS.
