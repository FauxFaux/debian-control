Description: [Physics] Monte Carlo simulation of photon radiation in decays
 The PHOTOS library simulates QED photon radiative corrections in
 electromagnetic decays.  The library is universal; it allows for easy
 interface with any program generating decays of any particle.  It can be
 used to estimate the size of the QED bremsstrahlung in leading-logarithmic
 approximation.  The proper soft photon behavior is also reproduced.
 .
 Note that in order to compile and link programs against this library, you
 must also install the libphotos202-dev package.
