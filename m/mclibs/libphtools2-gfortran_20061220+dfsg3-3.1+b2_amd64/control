Description: [Physics] General purpose Monte Carlo routines
 This library contains three main routines.  FOWL allows calculation of phase
 space distributions arising from particle interactions, generated in a
 Lorentz-invariant way.  GENBOD is an N-body event generator, taking as
 input the center-of-mass energy, number and masses of outgoing particles.
 WICO traces a ray geometrically in a "Winston Cone" light concentrator.
 .
 Note that in order to compile and link programs against this library, you
 must also install the libphtools2-dev package.
