Description: [Physics] data for CERNLIB Monte Carlo libraries
 CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for
 use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other
 fields such as the biological sciences.
 .
 This package provides data files for three Monte Carlo frameworks: COJETS,
 Eurodec, and ISAJET.  Although these data files are not strictly required
 (programs based on these frameworks may use locally supplied data instead),
 most people using one of these Monte Carlo generators will probably want
 to install this package.
 .
 The paths to the data files typically must be supplied to programs that are
 written to use these frameworks, either in the source code or interactively
 at runtime.  This package places the data files cojets.dat, eurodec.dat and
 isajet.dat into the directory /usr/share/montecarlo-data.
