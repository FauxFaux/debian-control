Description: GTK+ image viewer for comic books
 MComix is an user-friendly, customizable image viewer. It is specifically
 designed to handle comic books, but also serves as a generic viewer.
 It reads images in ZIP, RAR, 7Zip or tar archives as well as plain image
 files. It is written in Python and uses GTK+ through the PyGTK bindings,
 and runs on both Linux and Windows.
 .
 MComix is a fork of the Comix project, and aims to add bug fixes
 and stability improvements after Comix development came to a halt in late
 2009.
