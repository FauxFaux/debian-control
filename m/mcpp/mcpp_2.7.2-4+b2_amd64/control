Description: Alternative C/C++ preprocessor
 C/C++ preprocessor defines and expands macros and processes '#if',
 '#include' and some other directives.
 .
 mcpp is an alternative C/C++ preprocessor with the highest conformance.
 It supports multiple standards: K&R, ISO C90, ISO C99, and ISO C++98.
 mcpp is especially useful for debugging a source program which uses
 complicated macros and also useful for checking portability of a source.
 .
 Though mcpp could be built as a replacement of GCC's resident
 preprocessor or as a stand-alone program without using library build of
 mcpp, this package installs only a program named 'mcpp' which links
 shared library of mcpp and behaves independent from GCC.
