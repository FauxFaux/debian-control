Description: mouse device autodetection tool
 mdetect is a tool for autoconfiguring mice; it is typically used as the
 backend to some user-friendly frontend code.  mdetect writes the autodetected
 mouse device and protocol (as used by gpm) to standard output.  It can be
 invoked so as to produce output appropriate for XFree86 X server
 configuration files.
