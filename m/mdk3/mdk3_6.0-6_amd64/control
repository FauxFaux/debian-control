Description: Wireless attack tool for IEEE 802.11 networks
 MDK is a proof-of-concept tool to exploit common
 IEEE 802.11 (wifi) protocol weaknesses.
 Features:
   * Bruteforce MAC Filters.
   * Bruteforce hidden SSIDs (some small SSID wordlists included).
   * Probe networks to check if they can hear you.
   * Intelligent Authentication-DoS to freeze APs (with success checks).
   * FakeAP - Beacon Flooding with channel hopping (can crash NetStumbler and
     some buggy drivers)
   * Disconnect everything (aka AMOK-MODE) with Deauthentication and
     Disassociation packets.
   * WPA TKIP Denial-of-Service.
   * WDS Confusion - Shuts down large scale multi-AP installations.
