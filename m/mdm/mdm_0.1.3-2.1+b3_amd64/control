Description: Utilities for single-host parallel shell scripting
 The Middleman System (mdm) is a set of utilities that help you
 parallelize your shell scripts.  Simply label the commands to run in
 parallel, and the System automatically exploits every parallelization
 opportunity that arises at runtime.  You can also specify dependency
 between commands so that they run in an appropriate order.
 .
 Comes with an ncurses-based monitoring console.  Compatible with xargs,
 find, make, any shell, together, in a script or interactively.
