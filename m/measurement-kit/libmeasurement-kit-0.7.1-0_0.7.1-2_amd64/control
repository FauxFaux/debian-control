Description: Open Network Measurements Methodologies Library
 MeasurementKit is a library that implements open network measurement
 methodologies (performance, censorship, etc.) and targets mobile platforms
 (Android and iOS).
 .
 It is meant to be embedded by third party applications with specific network
 measurement needs and/or to be used by researchers as a basis to implement
 novel tools.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
