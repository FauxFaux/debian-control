Description: software package for FDTD simulation, parallel (OpenMPI) version
 Meep (or MEEP) is a free finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation
 software package developed at MIT to model electromagnetic systems.
 .
 Its features include:
   * Simulation in 1d, 2d, 3d, and cylindrical coordinates.
   * Distributed memory parallelism on any system supporting the MPI standard.
   * Dispersive (including loss/gain) and nonlinear (Kerr & Pockels) materials.
     Magnetic permeability and electric/magnetic conductivities.
   * PML absorbing boundaries and/or perfect conductor and/or Bloch-periodic
     boundary conditions.
   * Exploitation of symmetries to reduce the computation size .
     even/odd mirror symmetries and 90/180 degree rotations.
   * Complete scriptability - either via a Scheme scripting front-end
     (as in libctl and MPB), or callable as a C++ library.
   * Field output in the HDF5 standard scientific data format, supported by
     many visualization tools.
   * Arbitrary material and source distributions.
   * Field analyses including flux spectra, frequency extraction, and energy
     integrals; completely programmable.
   * Multi-parameter optimization, root-finding, integration, etcetera
     (via libctl).
 .
 This package contains the MPI version of the software.
 As opposed to meep-mpi this package also contains the OpenMPI version of
 libhdf5.
