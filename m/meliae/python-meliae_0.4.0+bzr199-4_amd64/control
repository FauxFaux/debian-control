Description: Memory analysis tool for Python
 Meliae is a library meant to help people understand how their memory is being
 used in Python.
 .
 This project is similar to heapy (in the 'guppy' project), in its attempt to
 understand how memory has been allocated.
 .
 Currently, its main difference is that it splits the task of computing
 summary statistics of memory consumption from the actual scanning of memory
 consumption.
