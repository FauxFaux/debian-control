Description: Persistent storage engine using the memcache protocol
 Memcachedb is a distributed key-value storage system designed for
 persistent data. It is NOT a cache solution, but a persistent storage
 engine for fast and reliable key-value based object storage and
 retrieval.
 .
 It conforms to the memcache protocol, so any memcached client can
 have connectivity with it. Memcachedb uses Berkeley DB as a storing
 backend, so lots of features including transactions and replication
 are available.
