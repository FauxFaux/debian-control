Description: utility to dump memory contents to standard output
 Program which dumps system memory to the standard output stream, skipping over
 holes in memory maps. By default, the program dumps the contents of physical
 memory.

 2.6 version, several kernels are enabling this option by default.
 .
 memdump is useful in security tests and forensics investigations.
