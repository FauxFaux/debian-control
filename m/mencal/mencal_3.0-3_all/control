Description: menstruation calendar
 Mencal is a menstruation calendar written in Perl.
 .
 It is a simple variation of the well-known Unix command cal. The main
 difference is that you can have some periodically repeating days highlighted
 in color. This can be used to track menstruation (or other) cycles
 conveniently.
