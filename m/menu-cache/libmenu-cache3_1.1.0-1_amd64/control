Description: LXDE implementation of the freedesktop Menu's cache
 Libmenu-cache is a library creating and utilizing caches to speed up
 the access to freedesktop.org defined application menus.
 .
 It can be used as a replacement of libgnome-menu of gnome-menus:
 .
  * Shorten time for loading menu entries.
  * Ease of use (API is very similar to that of libgnome-menu).
  * Lightweight runtime library (parsing of the menu definition files
    are done by menu-cache-gen when the menus are really changed).
  * Less unnecessary and complicated file monitoring.
  * Heavily reduced disk I/O.
