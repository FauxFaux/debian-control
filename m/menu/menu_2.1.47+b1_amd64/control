Description: generates programs menu for all menu-aware applications
 Debian menu keeps transparently the menus in the different
 window-managers in sync with the list of installed programs.

 menu-aware applications.

 Menu provides system-level and user-level configuration and overrides
 for both menu entries and menu-methods.
