Description: Contains functions for writing Mercurial extensions
 Contains functions used by Mercurial extension mercurial-keyring. They are
 mostly tiny utilities related to configuration processing or location
 matching. They either extend Mercurial APIs a bit or support tasks which
 aren't strictly Mercurial related, but happen repeatedly during extension
 writing.
