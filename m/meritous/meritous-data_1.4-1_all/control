Description: action-adventure dungeon crawl game (datafiles)
 Meritous is a action-adventure game with simple controls but a
 challenge to find a balance of power verses recovery time during
 real-time battles. Set in a fractually-generated world, the player
 can explore thousands of rooms in search of powerful artifacts, tools
 to help them, and to eventually free the Orcus Dome from evil.
 .
 This package contains the architecture-independent data files used by
 meritous.
