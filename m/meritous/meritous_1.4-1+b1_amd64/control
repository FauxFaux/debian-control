Description: action-adventure dungeon crawl game
 Far below the surface of the planet is a secret.  A place of limitless
 power. Those that seek to control such a utopia will soon bring an end
 to themselves. Seeking an end to the troubles that plague him, PSI
 user MERIT journeys into the hallowed Orcus Dome in search of answers.
 .
 Meritous is a action-adventure game with simple controls but a
 challenge to find a balance of power verses recovery time during
 real-time battles. Set in a fractually-generated world, the player
 can explore thousands of rooms in search of powerful artifacts, tools
 to help them, and to eventually free the Orcus Dome from evil.
