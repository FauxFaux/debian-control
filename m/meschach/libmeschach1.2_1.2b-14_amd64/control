Description: library for performing operations on matrices and vectors
 Meschach is a library of routines written in C for matrix
 computations. These include operations for basic numerical linear
 algebra; routines for matrix factorisations; solving systems of
 equations; solving least squares problems; computing eigenvalues,
 eigenvectors and singular values;sparse matrix computations including
 both direct and iterative methods. This package makes use of the
 features of the C programming language: data structures, dynamic
 memory allocation and deallocation, pointers, functions as parameters
 and objects. Meschach has a number of self-contained data structures
 for matrices, vectors and other mathematical objects.
