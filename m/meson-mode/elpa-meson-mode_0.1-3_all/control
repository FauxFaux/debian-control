Description: Major mode for the Meson build system files
 This is a major mode for Meson build system files. Syntax
 highlighting works reliably. Indentation works too, but there are
 probably cases, where it breaks. Simple completion is supported via
 `completion-at-point'. To start completion, use either <C-M-i> or
 install completion frameworks such as `company'. To enable
 `company' add the following to your .emacs:
 .
 (add-hook 'meson-mode-hook 'company-mode)
