Description: extract EXIF information from digital camera files
 EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) is a standard for storing interchange
 information in image files, especially those using JPEG compression. Most
 digital cameras, including mobile phones, now use the EXIF format.
 .
 The format is part of the DCF standard created by JEIDA to encourage the
 interoperability between imaging devices. In addition to the standard EXIF
 fields, MetaCam also supports vendor-specific extensions from Nikon, Olympus,
 Canon and Casio.
 .
 This program is useful in forensics investigations.
