Description: Save, diff, and restore filesystem metadata
 metamonger allows you to save, diff, and restore filesystem metadata like
 mtime, atime, uid, gid, etc. The storage backend is line-wise JSON; this makes
 it easy to commit, track, and merge the data with a VCS like Git as well as
 edit the stored data by hand.
