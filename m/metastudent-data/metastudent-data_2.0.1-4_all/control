Description: predictor of Gene Ontology terms from protein sequence - data files
 Often, only the sequence of a protein is known, but
 not its functions. Metastudent will try to predict
 missing functional annotations through homology searches (BLAST).
 .
 All predicted functions correspond to Gene Ontology (GO)
 terms from the Molecular Function Ontology (MFO) and the Biological Process
 Ontology (BPO) and are associated with a reliability score.
 .
 This package contains data files for metastudent.
