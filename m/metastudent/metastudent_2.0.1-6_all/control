Description: predictor of Gene Ontology terms from protein sequence
 Often, only the sequence of a protein is known, but
 not its functions. Metastudent will try to predict
 missing functional annotations through homology searches (BLAST).
 .
 All predicted functions correspond to Gene Ontology (GO)
 terms from the Molecular Function (MFO), the Biological Process
 (BPO) and the Cellular Component Ontology (CCO) and are associated
 with a reliability score.
