Description: Shared libraries  for MetView
 Metview has been designed as a flexible, modular and extendible system
 able to accommodate the evolving needs of the user.
 The system is based on the ECMWF standards for graphics (Magics) and
 data access (MARS) but can also access locally stored data.
 The user interface is based on Motif and Qt. Metview is a
 fully distributed system where modules can run on different workstations
 and servers.
 .
 This package provides shared libraries and  for  Metview-based software.
