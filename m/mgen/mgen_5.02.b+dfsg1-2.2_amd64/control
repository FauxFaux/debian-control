Description: packet generator for IP network performance tests
 MGEN provides the ability to perform IP network performance tests
 and measurements using TCP and UDP/IP traffic. Test messages
 can be generated, received and logged. MGEN offers control over
 all network parameters and timing of these messages. All this can be
 done either via the command line or defined in a file format for
 greater reproducibility.
