Description: Emacs interface to the MH mail system
 MH-E offers all the functionality of MH, the visual orientation and
 simplicity of use of a GUI, and full integration with Emacs and
 XEmacs, including thorough configuration and online help.
 .
 MH-E allows one to read and process mail very quickly: many commands
 are single characters; completion and smart defaults are used for
 folder names and aliases. With MH-E you compose outgoing messages in
 Emacs. This is a big plus for Emacs users, but even non-Emacs users
 have been known to use MH-E after only learning the most basic cursor
 motion commands.
 .
 Additional features include:
 .
   - attractive text rendering with font lock
   - composition and display of MIME body parts
   - display of images and HTML within the Emacs frame
   - folder browsing with speedbar
   - threading
   - ticking messages
   - lightning-fast full-text indexed searches of all of your email
   - virtual folders to view ticked and unseen messages, search results
   - multiple personalities
   - signing and encrypting
   - spam filter interaction
   - XFace, Face, X-Image-URL and picon header field support
 .
 MH is Rand's Mail Handler, whose functionality is available in MH,
 nmh and GNU mailutils.
 .
 This might be the same version as in the emacs23 package, but
 documentation is included. It also includes contributed files that are not
 distributed with GNU Emacs:
 .
   mh-frame.el      - Open MH-E in a separate frame.
   mh-comp-frame.el - Message composition in a separate frame.
