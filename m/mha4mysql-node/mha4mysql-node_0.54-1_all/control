Description: Master High Availability Manager and Tools for MySQL, Node Package
 MHA performs automating master failover and slave promotion with minimal
 downtime, usually within 10-30 seconds. MHA prevents replication consistency
 problems and saves on expenses of having to acquire additional servers.
 .
 All this with zero performance degradation, no complexity (easy-to-install)
 and requiring no change to existing deployments.
