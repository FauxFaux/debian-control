Description: reimplementation of the Pintail 16S DNA anomaly detection utility
 WigeoN examines the sequence conservation between a query and a trusted
 reference sequence, both in NAST alignment format. Based on the sequence
 identity between the query and the reference sequence, there is an
 expected amount of variation among the alignment. If the observed
 variation is greater than the 95% quantile of the distribution of
 variation observed between non-anomalous sequences, then it is flagged
 as an anomaly.
 .
 WigeoN is a flexible command-line based reimplementation of the Pintail
 algorithm Appl Environ Microbiol. 2005 Dec;7112:7724-36.
 .
 WigeoN is useful for flagging chimeras and anomalies only in near
 full-length 16S rRNA sequences. WigeoN lacks sensitivity with sequences
 less than 1000 bp.
 .
 To run WigeoN, you need NAST-formatted sequences generated by the
 nast-ier utility.
 .
 WigeoN is  part of the microbiomeutil suite.
