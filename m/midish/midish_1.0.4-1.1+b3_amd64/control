Description: shell-like MIDI sequencer/filter
 midish is a MIDI sequencer/filter implemented as a shell-like interpreter.
 It's intended to be lightweight, fast and reliable for real-time performance.
 Important features are: multiple MIDI devices handling, synchronisation to
 external MIDI devices, real-time MIDI filtering/routing (controller mapping,
 keyboard splitting, ...), track recording and editing (insert, copy, delete,
 quantize...), import and export of standard MIDI files, system exclusive
 messages handling.
