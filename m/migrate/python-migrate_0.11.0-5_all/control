Description: Database schema migration for SQLAlchemy - Python 2.7
 Inspired by Ruby on Rails' migrations, migrate provides a way to deal
 with database schema changes in SQLAlchemy projects.
 .
 SQLAlchemy-migrate is build on top of SQLAlchemy and provides a changeset
 and a versioning API for database schemas as well as a script utilizing
 these APIs. The database change sets are managed in a file based
 repository allowing upgrades and downgrades of database schema versions.
 The change sets may consist of Python code facilitating the changeset API
 or SQL scripts.
 .
 SQLAlchemy-migrate has support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite and Oracle
 databases. The support for Oracle is not as well tested as the support for
 the other database systems.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2.7 module.
