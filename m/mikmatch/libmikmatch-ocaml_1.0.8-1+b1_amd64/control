Description: camlp4 extension for pattern matching with regexps - runtime
 Mikmatch provides enhanced pattern matching with regexps for OCaml.
 .
 The goal of Mikmatch is to make text-oriented programs even easier to write,
 read and run without losing the unique and powerful features of OCaml.
 Mikmatch provides a concise and highly readable syntax for regular
 expressions, and integrates it into the syntax of OCaml thanks to Camlp4.
 .
 The implementation of Mikmatch consists essentially of:
  * a library which is loaded by the OCaml preprocessor (Camlp4) and
    defines sophisticated "macros", i.e. the modified syntax;
  * a traditional library (runtime) which is required by the programs that
    use the Mikmatch syntax;
  * a dedicated 'mikmatch' command which can be used as a replacement for
    'ocaml' in scripts or as an interactive toplevel. It performs automatically
    these steps: preprocessing, compilation and execution.
 .
 This package contains the shared runtime libraries.
