Description: Strips some unwanted MIME parts out of a MIME message.
 This program may be useful as a filter on a mailing list.
 .
 It strips every unwanted MIME part from a MIME compliant message, warning by
 email the original author about this, and outputs a MIME compliant cleaned
 message, to be further processed by a mailing list software.
 .
 You may find it useful if you don't want certain attachments on your mailing
 lists, or if you want to allow just the text part from multipart/alternative
 messages, and so on.  You can easily fine tune the list of allowed MIME types
 to suit your particular needs, using normal Perl regexps.
