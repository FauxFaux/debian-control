Description: C++ MIME library (documentation)
 mimetic is a MIME library written in C++ designed to be easy to use and
 integrate but yet fast and efficient.
 .
 mimetic has been built around the standard lib. This means that you'll not
 find yet another string class or list implementation and that you'll feel
 comfortable in using this library from the very first time.
 .
 mimetic doesn't use exceptions but it heavily uses templates so a mostly
 standard compliant C++ compiler is required.
 .
 This package contains the developers' documentation.
