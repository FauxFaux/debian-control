Description: mms (e.g. mms://) stream downloader
 mimms is a program designed to allow you to download streams using the
 MMS protocol and save them to your computer, as opposed to watching them
 live. Similar functionality is available in full media player suites such
 as Xine, MPlayer, and VLC, but mimms is quick and easy to use, and for the
 time being, remains a useful program.
