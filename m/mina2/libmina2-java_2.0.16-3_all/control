 Some of the features of Apache Mina are:
  - Unified API for various transport types: TCP/UDP/RS232/In-VM

  - Low-level and high-level API
  - Highly customizable thread model
  - Out-of-the-box SSL / TLS and StartTLS support using Java 5 SSLEngine
  - Overload shielding & traffic throttling
  - Unit testability using mock objects
