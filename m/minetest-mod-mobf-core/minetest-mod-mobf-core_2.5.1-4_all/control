Description: Minetest modpack providing a framework for creating mobs
 This minetest extension pack provides a framework for the creation of
 mobs, that is population of creatures with specific surroundings, movement,
 resources. Like sheeps providing wool and living on grasslands (but those
 are a use of the framework but not contained within).
