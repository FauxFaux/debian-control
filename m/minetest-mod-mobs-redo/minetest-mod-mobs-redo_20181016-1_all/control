Description: Minetest module to add mobs programming interface
 This minetest module provides an advanced programming interface to add
 mobs into the world.
 .
 It was built from PilzAdam's original Simple Mobs with additional mobs
 by KrupnoPavel, Zeg9, ExeterDad and AspireMint.
 .
 As it contains only the programming interface, you need to install
 other mobs to get actual gamer-visible creatures.
