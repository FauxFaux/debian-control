Description: Console-only getty
 Mingetty is a small, efficient, console-only getty for Linux.
 .
 "getty opens a tty port, prompts for a login name and invokes the
 /bin/login command. It is normally invoked by init(8)."
 .
 mingetty is a minimal getty for use on virtual consoles. Unlike
 the getty in the util-linux or mgetty packages, mingetty is not
 suitable for serial lines, which is why it's smaller.
