Description: Development files for MinGW-w64 targeting Win32
 MinGW-w64 provides a development and runtime environment for 32- and
 64-bit (x86 and x64) Windows applications using the Windows API and
 the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc).
 .
 This package contains the headers and libraries required to build
 32-bit software using MinGW-w64.
