Description: ultrafast de novo assembler for long noisy DNA sequencing reads
 Miniasm is an experimental very fast OLC-based de novo assembler for noisy
 long reads. It takes all-vs-all read self-mappings (typically by minimap)
 as input and outputs an assembly graph in the GFA format. Different from
 mainstream assemblers, miniasm does not have a consensus step. It simply
 concatenates pieces of read sequences to generate the final unitig sequences.
 Thus the per-base error rate is similar to the raw input reads.
