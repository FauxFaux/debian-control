Description: super micro binary to issue new CAs
 This is a super micro binary to issue new CAs. This contains nearly nothing
 else, and does not support revocation, or anything really important. This is
 just for when you need keys and don't intend to use them for anything big and
 important. Otherwise, issue things for real.
