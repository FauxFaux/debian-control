Description: Wrapper of parts of the Eigen library (Python 3)
 Small wrapper for core parts of Eigen, c++ library for linear algebra.
 It is mainly useful for inspecting c++ code which already uses eigen and
 boost::python. Supported types are Vectors (2,3,6 and dynamic-sized with
 integer and floating-point values), Matrices (3x3, 6x6 and dynamic-sized
 with floating-point values) and Quaternions. Numerous methods are wrapped
 and the original API of Eigen is followed.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version of the package.
