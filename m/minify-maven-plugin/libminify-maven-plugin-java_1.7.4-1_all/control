Description: Minify Maven Plugin
 Combine and minimize JavaScript and CSS files for faster page loading.
 This plugin produces a merged and a minified version of your CSS and
 JavaScript resources which can be re-used across your project, using
 yui-compressor and closure-compiler but allowing later addition of
 support for other tools.
