Description: Fast Imputation Based on State Space Reduction HMM
 Minimac4 is a lower memory and more computationally efficient implementation
 of "minimac2/3". It is an algorithm for genotypic imputation that works on
 phased genotypes (say from MaCH).
 .
 Minimac4 is designed to handle very large reference panels in a more
 computationally efficient way with no loss of accuracy. This algorithm
 analyzes only the unique sets of haplotypes in small genomic segments, thereby
 saving on time\-complexity, computational memory but no loss in degree of
 accuracy.
