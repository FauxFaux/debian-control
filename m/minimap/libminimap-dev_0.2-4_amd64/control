Description: development headers for libminimap
 Minimap is an experimental tool to efficiently find multiple approximate
 mapping positions between two sets of long sequences, such as between
 DNA reads and reference genomes, between genomes and between long noisy reads.
 .
 This package contains the C library headers for using minimap in custom tools,
 along with a static library.
