Description: library for approximate mapping of long biosequences
 Minimap is an experimental tool to efficiently find multiple approximate
 mapping positions between two sets of long sequences, such as between DNA
 reads and reference genomes, between genomes and between long noisy reads.
 .
 This package contains a shared library offering the minimap API to custom C
 programs.
