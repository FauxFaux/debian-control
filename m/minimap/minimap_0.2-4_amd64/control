Description: tool for approximate mapping of long biosequences such as DNA reads
 Minimap is an experimental tool to efficiently find multiple approximate
 mapping positions between two sets of long biological sequences, such as
 between DNA reads and reference genomes, between genomes and between long
 noisy reads.
 Minimap does not generate alignments as of now and because of this, it is
 usually tens of times faster than mainstream aligners.
 It does not replace mainstream aligners, but it can be useful when you
 want to quickly identify long approximate matches at moderate divergence among
 a huge collection of sequences. For this task, it is much faster than most
 existing tools.
