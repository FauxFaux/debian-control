Description: solver for pseudo-Boolean constraints
 MinSat+ is a solver for Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (AKA 0-1
 integer programming) that is based on the MiniSat SAT-solver. It
 supports optimizing a linear objective function, subject to a set
 of linear constraints. The variables of the objective function
 and constraints are boolean, i.e. required to be 0 or
 1. Pseudo-Boolean optimization can be used to solve many kinds of
 combinatorial optimization problems. This version of Minisat+ is
 compiled with bignum support for constraint coefficients.
