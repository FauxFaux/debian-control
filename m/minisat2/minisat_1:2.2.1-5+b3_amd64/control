Description: Fast and lightweight SAT solver
 Despite the NP completeness of the satisfiability problem of Boolean formulas
 (SAT), SAT solvers are often able to decide this problem in a reasonable time
 frame. As all other NP complete problems are reducible to SAT, the solvers
 have become a general purpose tool for this class of problems.
 .
 MiniSat is a minimalistic, open-source SAT solver, developed to help
 researchers and developers alike to get started on SAT. Winning all the
 industrial categories of the SAT 2005 competition, MiniSat is a good starting
 point both for future research in SAT, and for applications using SAT.
