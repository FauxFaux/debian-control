Description: UPnP IGD client lightweight library client
 The UPnP protocol is supported by most home adsl/cable routers and Microsoft
 Windows 2K/XP. The aim of the MiniUPnP project is to bring a free software
 solution to support the "Internet Gateway Device" part of the protocol. The
 MediaServer/MediaRenderer UPnP protocol is also becoming very popular.
 .
 Miniupnpc aims at the simplest library possible, with the smallest footprint
 and no dependencies to other libraries such as XML parsers or HTTP
 implementations. All the code is pure ANSI C. Compiled on a x86 PC, the
 miniupnp client library have less than 15KB code size. For instance, the upnpc
 sample program is around 20KB. The miniupnp daemon is much smaller than any
 other IGD daemon and is ideal for using on low memory device for this reason.
 .
 This package is an example client for the library.
