Description: nonlinear equations and nonlinear least squares static library
 Minpack includes software for solving nonlinear equations and
 nonlinear least squares problems.  Five algorithmic paths each include
 a core subroutine and an easy-to-use driver.  The algorithms proceed
 either from an analytic specification of the Jacobian matrix or
 directly from the problem functions.  The paths include facilities for
 systems of equations with a banded Jacobian matrix, for least squares
 problems with a large amount of data, and for checking the consistency
 of the Jacobian matrix with the functions.
 .
 This package provides the headers, man pages, examples, and static library.
