Description: Meteorological data Ingest-Processing Package (test suite)
 It's main task is to convert low level satellite data into a format
 understood by mpop (http://github.com/mraspaud/mpop).
 The primary purpose is to support Geostationary satellite data
 (level 1.5) but there is also support for the reading of some polar
 orbiting SAR data.
 .
 A more sophisticated interface to satellite data objects is supported
 by mpop.
 .
 Currently it handles data from all current Meteosat Second Generation
 (MSG) satellites, Meteosat 7, GOES 11-15, MTSAT's, and GOMS, all a
 retrieved via EUMETCast.
 .
 In addition mipp handles Synthetic Apperture Radar (SAR) data from
 Terrscan-X, Cosmo-Sky Med, and Radarsat 2.
 .
 This package contains the test suite (and related data) for mipp.
