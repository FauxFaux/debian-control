Description: MIT/GNU Scheme debugging files
 MIT/GNU Scheme is an implementation of the Scheme programming language,
 providing an interpreter, compiler, source-code debugger, integrated
 Emacs-like editor, and a large runtime library.  MIT/GNU Scheme is best
 suited to programming large applications with a rapid development
 cycle.
 .
 This package contains debugging files for the development
 environment.  These files provide support for debugging the MIT/GNU
 Scheme system, and are useful only if you need to see the system
 internals while you are debugging.
