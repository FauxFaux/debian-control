Description: utility to create ELF boot images from Linux kernel images
 mkelfImage is a program that makes an ELF boot image from a Linux
 kernel image.
 .
 The image should work with any i386 multiboot compliant ELF boot loader
 that passes no option. The image is compliant with the coreboot (previously
 LinuxBIOS) ELF booting spec and compatible with the Linux kexec kernel patch.
 .
 A key feature of mkelfImage is that nothing relies upon BIOS calls, but they
 can be made when necessary. This is useful for systems running on coreboot.
