Description: Intel Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (lib)
 Intel(R) Math Kernel Library for Deep Neural Networks (Intel(R) MKL-DNN) is
 an open source performance library for deep learning applications. The library
 accelerates deep learning applications and framework on Intel(R) architecture.
 Intel(R) MKL-DNN contains vectorized and threaded building blocks which you
 can use to implement deep neural networks (DNN) with C and C++ interfaces.
 .
 DNN functionality optimized for Intel architecture is also included in
 Intel(R) Math Kernel Library (Intel(R) MKL). API in this implementation
 is not compatible with Intel MKL-DNN and does not include certain new and
 experimental features.
 .
 One can choose to build Intel MKL-DNN without binary dependency. The resulting
 version will be fully functional, however performance of certain convolution
 shapes and sizes and inner product relying on SGEMM function may be suboptimal.
 .
 This package contains the shared object.
