Description: Create tagged images for Etherboot or Netboot
 With mknbi you can create tagged images for Etherboot. Tagged images are data
 files, which contain the necessary files for booting up (kernel+root for
 Linux, kernel+minifs for DOS, ...) bundled together with a special format.
 .
 These tagged images are downloaded and understood by Etherboot and Netboot
 during the boot process.
 .
 This package should be used on the server and not on the client. It doesn't
 contain code which handles the network card, downloads the image, etc.
