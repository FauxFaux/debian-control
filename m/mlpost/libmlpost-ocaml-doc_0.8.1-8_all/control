Description: Objective Caml interface to Metapost (doc)
 Mlpost is an OCaml library for scientific drawing. It relies on
 Metapost, giving the possibility to include (La)TeX fragments.
 Mlpost users can use the full power of OCaml to generate their
 diagrams, including static typing and the possibility to use any
 OCaml library. Moreover, Mlpost promotes a declarative style quite
 different from existing tools.
 .
 This package contains the API reference of the library.
