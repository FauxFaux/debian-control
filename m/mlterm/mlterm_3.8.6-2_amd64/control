 .
 Doublewidth characters for east Asian, combining characters for
 Thai, Vietnamese, and other diacritics, BiDi (bi-directionality)
 for Arabic and Hebrew as well as Arabic shaping are all supported.
 Though mlterm supports Indic complex languages such as Hindi, this
 Debian package is not compiled with Indic support.
 .
 Since mlterm checks the current locale and selects appropriate encoding,
 you don't need to configure mlterm to display your language and
 encoding.
 .
 mlterm also supports unique features such as scrollbar API,
 multiple windows, multiple XIM, anti-alias using FreeType and Xft,
 and so on.
