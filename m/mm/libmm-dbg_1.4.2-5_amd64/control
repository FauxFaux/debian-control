Description: Shared memory library - debugging symbols
 OSSP mm is a two layer abstraction library which simplifies the use of
 shared memory between forked (and therefore closely related) processes.
 It hides all platform-dependent aspects of the process from the user
 and provides a malloc(3)-style API.
 .
 This package contains debugging symbols for the library to aid
 debugging of programs that use it.
