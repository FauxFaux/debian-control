Description: Mass spectrometry tool for proteomics
 mMass is a free mass spectrum viewer/analyzer in which the
 following proteomics-related tasks can be performed:
 .
  - Open raw text, mzXML and mzData mass spectra;
  - Define peak lists;
  - Powerful mass spectrum viewer (zoom, cursor...);
  - Data recalibration;
  - Protein-only simulations;
  - Online Mascot searches.
 .
 The software can be easily extended by additional Python modules.
 This package contains the platform-independent parts of the software.
