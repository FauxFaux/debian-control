Description: GNU R package providing multivariate normal and t distribution
 This package provides functions for computing the density and the
 distribution function of, and for generating random vectors from the
 multivariate normal and multivariate t distributions.  It provides
 functions similar in scope to those of the package 'mvtnorm', but
 with some differences; one of these is that probabilities are
 computed via a non-Monte Carlo method.
