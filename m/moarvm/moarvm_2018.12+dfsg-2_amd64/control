Description: virtual machine for Rakudo Perl 6 and NQP
 Short for “Metamodel On A Runtime”, MoarVM is a runtime built for the
 6model object system. It is primarily aimed at running NQP and Rakudo
 Perl 6, but should be able to serve as a backend for any compilers
 built using the NQP compiler toolchain.
