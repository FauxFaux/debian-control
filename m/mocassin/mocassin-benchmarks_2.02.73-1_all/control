Description: benchmarks for the photoionisation code MOCASSIN
 mocassin is a fully 3D or 2D photoionisation and dust radiative transfer code
 which employs a Monte Carlo approach to the transfer of radiation through
 media of arbitrary geometry and density distribution. This package contains
 benchmark problems which can be run and compared with the outputs of other
 photoionisation codes.
