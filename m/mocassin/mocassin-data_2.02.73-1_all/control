Description: atomic and optical data for the photoionisation code MOCASSIN
 mocassin is a fully 3D or 2D photoionisation and dust radiative transfer code
 which employs a Monte Carlo approach to the transfer of radiation through
 media of arbitrary geometry and density distribution. This package contains
 the atomic and optical data necessary to run simulations.
