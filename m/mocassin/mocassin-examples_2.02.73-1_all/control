Description: Examples for the photoionisation code MOCASSIN
 mocassin is a fully 3D or 2D photoionisation and dust radiative transfer code
 which employs a Monte Carlo approach to the transfer of radiation through
 media of arbitrary geometry and density distribution. This package contains
 example input for files for some of the complex simulations that MOCASSIN is
 capable of.
