Description: MOnte CArlo SimulationS of Ionised Nebulae
 mocassin is a fully 3D or 2D photoionisation and dust radiative transfer code
 which employs a Monte Carlo approach to the transfer of radiation through
 media of arbitrary geometry and density distribution. It was originally
 developed for the modelling of photoionised regions like HII regions and
 planetary nebulae and has since expanded and been applied to a variety of
 astrophysical problems, including modelling clumpy dusty supernova envelopes,
 star forming galaxies, protoplanetary disks and inner shell fluorence emission
 in the photospheres of stars and disk atmospheres. The code can deal with
 arbitrary Cartesian grids of variable resolution, it has successfully been
 used to model complex density fields from SPH calculations and can deal with
 ionising radiation extending from Lyman edge to the X-ray. The dust and gas
 microphysics is fully coupled both in the radiation transfer and in the
 thermal balance.
