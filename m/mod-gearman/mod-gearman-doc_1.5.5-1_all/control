Description: Documentation and examples for Mod-Gearman
 Mod-Gearman is an easy way of distributing active Icinga/Nagios checks across
 your network and increasing nagios scalability. Mod-Gearman can even help to
 reduce the load on a single nagios host, because its much smaller and more
 efficient in executing checks.
 .
 This package contains documentation and examples common to the
 mod-gearman-module and mod-gearman-worker packages.
