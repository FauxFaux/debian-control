Description: Apache2 module to get MIME info from filesystem extended attributes
 This is a module for the Apache HTTPD 2.4 which may be used to set a range of
 MIME properties of files served from a document tree with extended attributes
 (EAs) as supported by the underlying file system. The following attributes may
 be used:
 .
  - user.mime_type: set the MIME type of a file explicitly. This attribute is
    compatible with the shared MIME database specification as published by
    freedesktop.org.
  - user.charset: set the charset used in a file.
  - user.mime_encoding: set the MIME encoding of a file (e.g. gzip).
  - user.apache_handler: set the apache handler of a file explicitly.
