Description: Apache module for Outlook Anywhere support in reverse proxy setups
 This module intends to make Apache httpd work in a reverse proxy setup in front
 of a MS Exchange server offering Outlook Anywhere services. Without it, Apache
 would block any Outlook Anywhere requests as the used protocol does not fully
 comply with HTTP standards.
 .
 The mod_proxy_msrpc module detects the used MSRPC messages and forwards them
 to the server or client as needed. As soon as the initial handshake completed,
 i.e.  Exchange accepted the connecting client, the mod_proxy_msrpc module
 switches into tunnel mode and forwards all data from client to server and vice
 versa.
