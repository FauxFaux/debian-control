Description: JavaScript library to detect HTML5 and CSS3 features in the user's browser
 Modernizr is a JavaScript library allowing you to use HTML5 & CSS3 while
 maintaining control over unsupported browsers.
 .
 Modernizr tests which native CSS3 and HTML5 features are available in
 the current user agent and makes the results available to you in two ways,
 as properties on a global `Modernizr` object, and as classes on the
 `<html>` element. This information allows you to progressively enhance
 your pages with a granular level of control over the experience.
