Description: tool to make module package creation easier
 The module-assistant tool (also known as m-a) helps users and maintainers
 with managing external Linux kernel modules packaged for Debian. It can
 do:
 .
  * automated preparation of build environment for module compilation
    (e.g. automatic detection and installation of required kernel
    source/headers);
  * automated module source downloads;
  * configuration and tracking of external and locally built modules
    packages;
  * semi-automated multiple builds for multiple kernel versions;
 .
 It also contains some infrastructure to be used by the build-scripts in the
 accompanying modules-source packages in Debian.
