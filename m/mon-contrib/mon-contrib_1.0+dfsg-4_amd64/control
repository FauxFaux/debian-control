Description: contributed tools, monitors and alert for mon
 mon-contrib is the mon /contrib archive. It contains user-submitted
 add-ons to mon, which are not included in the main mon distribution.

 Most submissions are not checked by the archive maintainers for quality
 and some may not work, or work how you expect them to (most are quite
 good, though).
 .
 If you have something to contribute, either a new submission or a patch
 to another contrib'ed item, great! Please read the contrib guidelines to
 speed up the inclusion of your submission in the archives.
