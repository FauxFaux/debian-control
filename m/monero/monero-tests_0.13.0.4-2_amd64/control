Description: cryptocoin client for Monero network - testsuite
 Full Monero client (a.k.a. Monero Core) is a full-node wallet
 for the Monero network.
 .
 Monero (XMR) is an open-source cryptocurrency
 that focuses on privacy and decentralization.
 Monero uses a public ledger to record transactions
 while new units are created through a process called mining.
 Monero aims to improve on existing cryptocurrency design
 by obscuring sender, recipient and amount of every transaction made
 as well as making the mining process more egalitarian.
 .
 This package provides the test suite for Full Monero client.
