Description: cryptocoin client for Monero network - daemon and tools
 Full Monero client (a.k.a. Monero Core) is a full-node wallet
 for the Monero network.
 .
 Monero (XMR) is an open-source cryptocurrency
 that focuses on privacy and decentralization.
 Monero uses a public ledger to record transactions
 while new units are created through a process called mining.
 Monero aims to improve on existing cryptocurrency design
 by obscuring sender, recipient and amount of every transaction made
 as well as making the mining process more egalitarian.
 .
 This package provides the daemon monerod for Full Monero client,
 and command-line tools to interact with the daemon.
 .
 Beware that full global transaction history (blockchain) is stored locally,
 which may require very large amounts of disk space.
 .
 Disk space requirements (as of June 2018):
 ~40 gigabyte data, ~50 gigabyte on disk, growing ~2 gigabyte per month.
