Description: MongoDB Java Driver
 Debian package for the official MongoDB Java Driver providing both synchronous
 and asynchronous interaction with MongoDB. Powering the drivers is a new driver
 core and BSON library.
 .
 Features
 .
 BSON Library
 A standalone BSON library, with a new Codec infrastructure that you can use to
 build high-performance encoders and decoders without requiring an intermediate
 Map instance.
 .
 MongoDB Driver
 An updated Java driver that includes the legacy API as well as a new generic
 MongoCollection interface that complies with a new cross-driver CRUD
 specification.
 .
 MongoDB Async Driver
 A new asynchronous API that can leverage either Netty or Java 7's
 AsynchronousSocketChannel for fast and non-blocking IO.
 .
 Core driver
 The MongoDB Driver and Async Driver are both built on top of a new core
 library, which anyone can use to build alternative or experimental high-level
 APIs.
