Description: programming language agnostic web server (binaries)
 Mongrel2 is an application, programming language, and network
 architecture agnostic web server that focuses on web applications using
 modern browser technologies.

 Mongrel2 supports 17 languages and platforms, HTTP, Flash sockets,
 WebSockets, Long Polling, and many ways to deploy and hack on it.
