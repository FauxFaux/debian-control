Description: OpenPGP key signing and exchange for humans
 monkeysign is a tool to overhaul the OpenPGP keysigning experience
 and bring it closer to something that most primates can understand.
 .
 The project makes use of cheap digital cameras and the type of bar
 code known as a QRcode to provide a human-friendly yet still-secure
 keysigning experience.
 .
 No more reciting tedious strings of hexadecimal characters.  And, you
 can build a little rogue's gallery of the people that you have met
 and exchanged keys with!
 .
 Monkeysign is the commandline signing software, a caff
 replacement. Monkeyscan is the graphical user interface that scans
 qrcodes.
