Description: addin framework for extensible CLI applications/libraries
 Mono.Addins is a framework for creating extensible CLI applications, and for
 creating libraries which extend those applications.
 Mono.Addins has been designed to be easy to use and useful for a wide range
 of applications: from simple applications with small extensibility needs, to
 complex applications which need support for large add-in structures.
 .
 This new framework intends to set an standard for building extensible
 applications and add-ins in Mono.
 .
 This package contains development files related to the Mono.Addins library,
 and should be used for compilation.
