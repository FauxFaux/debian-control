Description: Command-line utility for Mono.Addins management
 Mono.Addins is a framework for creating extensible CLI applications, and for
 creating libraries which extend those applications.
 Mono.Addins has been designed to be easy to use and useful for a wide range
 of applications: from simple applications with small extensibility needs, to
 complex applications which need support for large add-in structures.
 .
 This package contains a command-line utility to easily manipulate Mono.Addins
 registries provided by other software (including user-written applications).
