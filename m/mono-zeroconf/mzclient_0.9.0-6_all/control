Description: CLI library for multicast DNS service discovery (commandline tool)
 Mono.Zeroconf is a cross platform Zero Configuration Networking library for
 Mono and .NET. It provides a unified API for performing the most common
 zeroconf operations on a variety of platforms and subsystems: all the
 operating systems supported by Mono and both the Avahi and
 Bonjour/mDNSResponder transports.
 .
 By using Mono.ZeroConf applications can use a single API that will work
 regardless of the underlying implementation that a particular operating
 system uses.
 .
 Applications can publish services that will be exposed to other computers on
 the network and also query the local machines on the network for services
 that could have been exposed.
 .
 This package contains the mzclient tool, that can be used for resolving or
 publishing services from the commandline.
