Description: Mono Messaging library (for CLI 4.0)
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Xamarin.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 This package contains the Mono.Messaging library for CLI 4.0, which provides
 messaging functionality using different implementations. At this time Mono
 does not provide a System.Messaging implementation.
