Description: Mono SIMD (for CLI 4.0)
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Xamarin.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 This package contains the Mono.Simd library for CLI 4.0, which provides a
 number of classes that are hardware accelerated by mapping the classes and
 the actual operations to native SIMD instructions on a processor.
