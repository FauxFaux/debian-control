Description: Mono System.ServiceModel.Internals Library (for CLI 4.0)
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Xamarin.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 This package contains the System.ServiceModel.Internals library which is part
 of the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) libraries of Mono for CLI 4.0.
 The WFC stack is for building SOA-based applications.
 Its development is in early stages.
