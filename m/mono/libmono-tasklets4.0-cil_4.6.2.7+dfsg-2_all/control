Description: Mono Tasklets library (for CLI 4.0)
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Xamarin.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 This package contains the Mono Tasklets library for CLI 4.0.
 .
 The Mono.Tasklets library provides a continuation framework that allows for
 a number of high-level abstractions like co-routines and cooperative
 multi-threading to be implemented on top of it.
