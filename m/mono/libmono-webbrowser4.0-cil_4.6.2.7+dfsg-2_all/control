Description: Mono Web Browser library (for CLI 4.0)
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Xamarin.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 This package contains an empty implementation of the WebControl class - it will
 not render anything, but also should not crash applications which try to create
 a WebControl.
