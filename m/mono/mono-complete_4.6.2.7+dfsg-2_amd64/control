Description: complete Mono runtime, development tools and all libraries
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Xamarin.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 This is a metapackage and pulls in the Mono runtime, development tools and
 all libraries.
 .
 Install this package if you want to run software for Mono or Microsoft .NET
 which you are not installing from a Debian package.
 .
 For packagers: This package is not to be used as dependency for packages!
 You should build-depend on cli-common-dev and the needed libraries instead.
