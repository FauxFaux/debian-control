Description: Mono GAC tool
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Xamarin.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 This package pulls in the default GAC (Global Assembly Cache) tool (gacutil)
 used by Mono to store shared CIL (Common Intermediate Language) libraries.
