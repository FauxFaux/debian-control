Description: LALR(1) parser generator oriented to Java/CLI
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Xamarin.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 Jay is a Yacc implementation oriented to Java-like input syntax. It
 takes a grammar, specified in BNF and augmented with semantic actions,
 and generates tables and an interpreter which recognizes the language
 defined by the grammar and executes the semantic actions as their
 corresponding phrases are recognized.
