Description: Mono runtime - common files
 Mono is a platform for running and developing applications based on the
 ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono is an open source effort led by Xamarin.
 Mono provides a complete CLR (Common Language Runtime) including compiler and
 runtime, which can produce and execute CIL (Common Intermediate Language)
 bytecode (aka assemblies), and a class library.
 .
 This package contains common files for the Virtual Machine, JIT (Just-in-Time) and
 AOT (Ahead-of-Time) code generator "mono".
 "mono" executes applications for the CLI (Common Language Infrastructure).
 Mono currently only supports the X86, PowerPC, ARM, S/390x, AMD64 and
 MIPS architectures. Optionally this package configures BINFMT support.
