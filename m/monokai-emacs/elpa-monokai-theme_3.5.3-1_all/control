Description: fruity color theme for Emacs
 Monokai for Emacs is a port of the popular TextMate theme Monokai by Wimer
 Hazenberg, built on top of the new built-in theme support in Emacs 24. The
 inspiration for the theme came from Bozhidar Batsov and his Zenburn port and
 Sublime Text 2 which defaults to this color scheme.
