Description: Distributed version (revision) control system - documentation
 Monotone is a free, distributed version control system. It provides
 fully disconnected operation, manages complete tree versions, keeps
 its state in a local transactional database, supports overlapping
 branches and extensible metadata, uses an efficient peer-to-peer
 network protocol, performs history-sensitive merging, and delegates
 trust functions to client-side RSA certificates.
 .
 This package contains the documentation for monotone in Info, HTML, and PDF
 formats.
