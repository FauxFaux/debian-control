Description: Create files to run montage on the grid
 Montage is a toolkit for assembling astronomical images into custom mosaics.
 .
 This package contains modules that can generate a Directed Acyclic Graph
 (DAG) representation of the mosaicking process for a set of on-line surveys
 (e.g., 2MASS). This information is fed to the Pegasus software from ISI (the
 Information Sciences Institute), which produces processing plans for Condor
 (or Condor-G on the Teragrid).
 .
 These modules should be considered prototypes: they have been used
 extensively but have not been subject to the same rigorous testing to which
 the core modules have been subjected. Users should contact Montage
 (montage@ipac.caltech.edu) before employing them to verify limitations in
 their use and changes in the interfaces.
