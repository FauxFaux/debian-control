Description: Toolkit for assembling FITS images into mosaics
 Montage is a toolkit for assembling astronomical images into custom mosaics.
 .
 It uses algorithms that preserve the calibration and positional (astrometric)
 fidelity of the input images to deliver mosaics that meet user-specified
 parameters of projection, coordinates, and spatial scale. It supports all
 projections and coordinate systems in use in astronomy.
 .
 It contains independent modules for analyzing the geometry of images on the
 sky, and for creating and managing mosaics; these modules are powerful tools
 in their own right and have applicability outside mosaic production, in areas
 such as data validation.
