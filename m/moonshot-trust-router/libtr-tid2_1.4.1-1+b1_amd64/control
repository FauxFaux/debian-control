Description: Moonshot Temporary Identity  Shared Libraries
 Moonshot allows services using GSS-API applications to gain federated
 access to identities provided by other organizations.  Moonshot uses
 EAP and RADIUS over TLS for authentication and federation and SAML
 for enhanced attribute exchange.
 .
 This package provides the trust router's Temporary Identity Protocol
 client and server library.  The trust router provides authenticated
 key exchange so that RADIUS proxies in one organization can connect
 to RADIUS servers (providing identities) in another organization.
