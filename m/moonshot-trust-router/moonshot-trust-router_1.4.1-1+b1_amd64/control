Description: Moonshot Trust Router
 Moonshot allows services using GSS-API applications to gain federated
 access to identities provided by other organizations.  Moonshot uses
 EAP and RADIUS over TLS for authentication and federation and SAML
 for enhanced attribute exchange.
 .
 This package provides the trust router and associated commands.  The
 trust router provides authenticated key exchange so that RADIUS
 proxies in one organization can connect to RADIUS servers (providing
 identities) in another organization.
