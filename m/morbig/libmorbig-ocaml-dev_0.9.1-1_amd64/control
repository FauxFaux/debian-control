Description: OCaml libraries of the morbig shell parser (development files)
 Morbig is a parser for shell scripts that are written in the POSIX
 shell script language. It parses the scripts statically, that is
 without executing them, and constructs a concrete syntax tree for
 each of them. The concrete syntax trees are built using constructors
 according to the shell grammar of the POSIX standard.
 .
 This package contains the development stuff you need to use morbig for
 the development of programs. It provides, among others, functions for
 parsing shell scripts, the type definition of concrete syntax trees,
 and functions for reading and writing concrete syntax trees.
