Description: Parser for POSIX shell scripts
 Morbig is a parser for shell scripts that are written in the POSIX
 shell script language. It parses the scripts statically, that is
 without executing them, and constructs a concrete syntax tree for
 each of them.  The concrete syntax trees are built using constructors
 according to the shell grammar of the POSIX standard.
 .
 This package contains the parser tool which allows you to parse shell
 scripts, and to obtain their concrete syntax tree in various formats.
