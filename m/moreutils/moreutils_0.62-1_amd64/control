Description: additional Unix utilities
 This is a growing collection of the Unix tools that nobody thought
 to write long ago, when Unix was young.
 .
 So far, it includes the following utilities:
  - chronic: runs a command quietly unless it fails
  - combine: combine the lines in two files using boolean operations
  - errno: look up errno names and descriptions
  - ifdata: get network interface info without parsing ifconfig output
  - ifne: run a program if the standard input is not empty
  - isutf8: check if a file or standard input is utf-8
  - lckdo: execute a program with a lock held
  - mispipe: pipe two commands, returning the exit status of the first
  - parallel: run multiple jobs at once
  - pee: tee standard input to pipes
  - sponge: soak up standard input and write to a file
  - ts: timestamp standard input
  - vidir: edit a directory in your text editor
  - vipe: insert a text editor into a pipe
  - zrun: automatically uncompress arguments to command
