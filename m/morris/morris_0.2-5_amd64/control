Description: Nine men's morris game
 Morris is an implementation of the board game "Nine Men's Morris".
 Sometimes simply called Mills, Morris, Merrills, or MÃ¼hle in German.

 several rule-variants and different boards. The game supports a
 strong computer player which learns from past games played.
