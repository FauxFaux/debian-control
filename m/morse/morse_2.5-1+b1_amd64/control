Description: training program about morse-code for aspiring radio hams
 It can generate random tests or simulated QSOs resembling those
 used in the ARRL test (a QSO generator is included). There are a
 plethora of options to vary the training method. In one of the simpler
 modes, this program will take text from standard input and render it
 as Morse-code beeps.
