Description: convert text file to ASCII morse code
 Morse code was created for the telegraph in the early 1840s. Morse
 code uses a standardized sequence of short and long elements to
 represent the letters, numerals, punctuation and special characters
 of a given message.
 .
 This program implements the International Morse Code Standard by
 converting ASCII text letters into morse code ASCII notation.
