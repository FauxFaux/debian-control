Description: sequence analysis suite for research on microbiota
 Mothur seeks to develop a single piece of open-source, expandable
 software to fill the bioinformatics needs of the microbial ecology
 community. It has incorporated the functionality of dotur, sons,
 treeclimber, s-libshuff, unifrac, and much more. In addition to improving
 the flexibility of these algorithms, a number of other features including
 calculators and visualization tools were added.
