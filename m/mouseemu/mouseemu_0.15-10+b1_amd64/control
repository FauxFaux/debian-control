Description: Emulate mouse buttons and mouse wheel
 Mouseemu is a daemon to emulate mouse buttons on trackpads
 with only one button. It lets you:
  - emulate middle and right click
  - emulate mouse wheel
  - block trackpad while typing
 .
 It was initially developed for Apple PowerBooks
 and iBooks, but it may be useful on other architectures
 as well.
 .
 This program only works when booting a 2.6 kernel because
 it uses the new uinput interface to emulate the mouse.
