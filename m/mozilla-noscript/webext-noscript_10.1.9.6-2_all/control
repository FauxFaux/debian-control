Description: permissions manager for Firefox
 This extension brings a powerful control over the way external scripts or
 embedded programs, such as Java or Flash, are loaded.
 .
 By blocking scripts and/or plugins, it improves security and disables annoying
 behaviours caused by malicious scripts.
 .
 When a script is blocked, you are notified, and you can unblock a site or a
 page, either temporarily or permanently. You can then set a whitelist of
 trusted sites based on URL or on domain name.
