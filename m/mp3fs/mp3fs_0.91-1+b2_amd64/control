Description: FUSE filesystem for transcoding FLAC to MP3 on the fly
 MP3FS is a read-only FUSE filesystem which transcodes audio formats
 (currently FLAC) to MP3 on the fly when opened and read.
 .
 It is also a novel alternative to traditional mp3 encoder applications.
 Users can use their favorite file browser to select the files they want
 encoded and copy them somewhere.
