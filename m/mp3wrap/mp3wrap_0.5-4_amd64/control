Description: Utility for MP3 wrapping (rolling multiple MP3s into one)
 Command-line utility that wraps multiple MP3 files into a single, playable
 MP3, without losing filenames or ID3 information, and without reencoding. Also
 supports archiving non-audio data such as playlists, info files, and cover
 images inside the MP3. These files can be unpacked later (using mp3splt, e.g.);
 ordinary MP3 decoders can play the entire audio stream as one long track.
