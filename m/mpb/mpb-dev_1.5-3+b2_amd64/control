Description: MIT Photonic-Bands development files
 The MIT Photonic-Bands package is a free program for computing the band
 structures (dispersion relations) and electromagnetic modes of periodic
 dielectric structures, on both serial and parallel computers. It was
 developed by Steven G. Johnson at MIT in the Joannopoulos Ab Initio
 Physics group, and designed to study photonic crystal structures.
 .
 This package contains the header files for development of own software.
