Description: small command line tools and toys for MPD
 This is a collection of small toys and tools for doing various things
 to MPD (Music Player Daemon) from the command line. Some of them are
 very useful, while others are only amusing.
 .
 Some examples of things the mpdtoys can do include moving the playing
 song between different mpd daemons on different machines, storing
 the state of a mpd daemon and loading it back later, reversing the
 playlist, slowly fading volume up or down, stopping playback after the
 current song finishes, emulating a skipping record, and editing the
 playlist in a text editor.
