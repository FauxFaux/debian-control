Description: toolbox to manipulate MPEG files (video, system, and audio)
 mpgtx is a tool to manipulate MPEG files. Its features include the

 .
   * mpgtx can currently split and join MPEG 1 video files and most
     MPEG audio files.
   * mpgtx can fetch detailed information from MPEG 1 and MPEG 2.
   * mpgtx can demultiplex MPEG 1 and MPEG 2 files (System layer, Program
     layer and Transport Layer).
