 The MPI testsuite is taken from the MPICH source tree. It exercises a wide
 range of MPI tests written in C, C++, Fortran77 and Fortran90. Both the MPI-2
 and the MPI-3 standard is targetted. Currently the following MPI
 implementations and threadlevels are tested:
 .
  * OpenMPI, MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED
  * MPICH, MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE
 .
 This package contains the testsuite results for each run in TAP, JUNIT and XML
