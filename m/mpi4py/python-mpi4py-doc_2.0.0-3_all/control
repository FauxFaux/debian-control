Description: bindings of the MPI standard -- documentation
 MPI for Python (mpi4py) provides bindings of the Message Passing
 Interface (MPI) standard for the Python programming language,
 allowing any Python program to exploit multiple processors.
 .
 mpi4py is constructed on top of the MPI-1/MPI-2 specification
 and provides an object oriented interface which closely follows MPI-2
 C++ bindings.  It supports point-to-point (sends, receives) and
 collective (broadcasts, scatters, gathers) communications of any
 picklable Python object as well as optimized communications of Python
 object exposing the single-segment buffer interface (NumPy arrays,
 builtin bytes/string/array objects).
 .
 This package provides HTML rendering of the user's manual.
