Description: bindings of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard
 MPI for Python (mpi4py) provides bindings of the Message Passing
 Interface (MPI) standard for the Python programming language,
 allowing any Python program to exploit multiple processors.
 .
 mpi4py is constructed on top of the MPI-1/MPI-2 specification
 and provides an object oriented interface which closely follows MPI-2
 C++ bindings.  It supports point-to-point (sends, receives) and
 collective (broadcasts, scatters, gathers) communications of any
 picklable Python object as well as optimized communications of Python
 object exposing the single-segment buffer interface (NumPy arrays,
 builtin bytes/string/array objects).
