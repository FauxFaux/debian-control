Description: Massively Parallel Quantum Chemistry Program
 MPQC is an ab-inito quantum chemistry program.  It is especially designed
 to compute molecules in a highly parallelized fashion.
 .
 It can compute energies and gradients for the following methods:
  * Closed shell and general restricted open shell Hartree-Fock (HF)
  * Density Functional Theory (DFT)
  * Closed shell second-order Moeller-Plesset pertubation theory (MP2)
 .
 Additionally, it can compute energies for the following methods:
  * Open shell MP2 and closed shell explicitly correlated MP2 theory (MP2-R12)
  * Second order open shell pertubation theory (OPT2[2])
  * Z-averaged pertubation theory (ZAPT2)
 .
 It also includes an internal coordinate geometry optimizer.
 .
 MPQC is built upon the Scientific Computing Toolkit (SC).
