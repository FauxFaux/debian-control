Description: Massively Parallel Quantum Chemistry Program
 MPQC3 is an ab-inito quantum chemistry program.  It is especially designed to
 compute molecules in an explicitly-correlated fashion.
 .
 It can compute energies and gradients for the following methods:
  * Hartree-Fock (HF)
  * Density Functional Theory (DFT)
  * Second-order Moeller-Plesset pertubation theory (MP2)
 .
 Additionally, it can compute energies for the following methods:
  * Local MP2 (LMP2)
  * Explicitly-correlated density-fitted MP2 (DF-MP2-F12)
  * Explicitly-correlated density-fitted coupled-cluster singles doubles
    (DF-CCSD-F12)
  * Explicitly-correlated density-fitted coupled-cluster singles doubles with
    perturbative triples (DF-CCSD(T)-F12)
  * Explicitly-correlated density-fitted complete active space SCF
    (DF-CASSCF-F12)
  * Explicitly-correlated density-fitted multi-reference configuration
    interaction (DF-MRCI-F12)
 .
 It also includes an internal coordinate geometry optimizer.
