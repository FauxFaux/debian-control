Description: single-locus species delimitation
 Implementation of a fast species delimitation method, based on PTP
 (Zhang et al. 2013) with a 64-bit multi-threaded design that handles
 very large datasets.
 .
 The tool mPTP can handle very large biodiversity datasets. It implements
 a fast method to compute the ML delimitation from an inferred
 phylogenetic tree of the samples. Using MCMC, it also computes the
 support values for each clade, which can be used to assess the
 confidence of the ML delimitation.
 .
 ML delimitation mPTP implements two flavours of the point-estimate
 solution. First, it implements the original method from (Zhang et al.
 2013) where all within-species processes are modelled with a single
 exponential distribution. mPTP uses a dynamic programming implementation
 which estimates the ML delimitation faster and more accurately than the
 original PTP. The dynamic programming implementation has similar
 properties as (Gulek et al. 2010). See the wiki for more information.
 The second method assumes a distinct exponential distribution for the
 branching events of each of the delimited species allowing it to fit to
 a wider range of empirical datasets.
 .
 MCMC method mPTP generates support values for each clades. They
 represent the ratio of the number of samples for which a particular node
 was in the between-species process, to the total number of samples.
