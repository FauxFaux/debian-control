Description: Java MQTT Client API
 mqtt-client is a Java implementation of the MQTT publish-subscribe messaging
 protocol. It takes care of automatically reconnecting to the MQTT server and
 restoring the client session if any network failures occur. Applications can
 use a blocking API style, a futures based API, or a callback/continuations
 passing API style.
