Description: data files for MRIcron
 This is a GUI-based visualization and analysis tool for (functional) magnetic
 resonance imaging. MRIcron can be used to create 2D or 3D renderings of
 statistical overlay maps on brain anatomy images. Moreover, it aids drawing
 anatomical regions-of-interest (ROI), or lesion mapping, as well as basic
 analysis of functional timeseries (e.g. creating plots of peristimulus
 signal-change).
 .
 This package provides data files for MRIcron, such as brain atlases, anatomy,
 and color schemes.
