Description: Development files for libmrtd0
 Machine-readable travel documents such as passports nowadays usually contain
 an RFID chip for storing various data. This library provides useful functions
 for reading out the data from these documents. This version of the library
 supports the Basic Access Control (BAC). It uses several cryptographic
 functions from either libgcrypt or libtomcrypt (depending on compile-time
 options) in order to do the necessary decryption of the content of the MRTDs.
 The key for the BAC-scheme is derived from the Machine-readable zone (MRZ)
 which is printed on the MRTD.
 .
 The library depends on libnfc for the hardware interaction and only devices
 supported by libnfc will therefore work.
 .
 This package contains header files for building programs linked with
 libmrtd0.
