Description: Utilities to generate statistics for mrtg (from lm-sensors)
 MRTGutils is a collection of simple utilities to generate output useful for
 mrtg. Many of the existing mrtg setups use shell or perl scripts to gather
 output. On busy systems, these scripts can generate a lot of extra load. These
 (small) C programs can return the given statistics more efficiently.
 .
 This package provides the binary mrtg-sensors that returns data sensors
 information from lm-sensors.
