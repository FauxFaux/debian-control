Description: Utilities to generate statistics for mrtg
 MRTGutils is a collection of simple utilities to generate output useful for
 mrtg. Many of the existing mrtg setups use shell or perl scripts to gather
 output. On busy systems, these scripts can generate a lot of extra load. These
 (small) C programs can return the given statistics more efficiently.
 .
 This package provides the following binaries that return:
  - mrtg-load: the current load average (5-minute average)
  - mrtg-ip-acct: the number of IP packets that have traversed an interface
  - mrtg-apache: the number of hits to a Apache web site
