 Programs like Quagga / Zebra, BIRD, OpenBGPD and PyRT can dump the
 MRT format data. Archives are also available from the Route Views
 Projects and RIPE NCC.

 This package contains various utilities using the Python module,
 including a tool to convert to an ExaBGP input, a tool to a bgpdump
 input, a tool to dump all the information as text and a tool to print
 a short summary.
