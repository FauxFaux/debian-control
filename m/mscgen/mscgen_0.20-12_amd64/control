Description: Message Sequence Chart (MSC) generator
 mscgen is a small program that parses Message Sequence Chart
 descriptions and produces PNG, SVG, EPS or server side image
 maps (ismaps) as the output. Message Sequence Charts (MSCs)
 are a way of representing entities and interactions over some
 time period and are often used in combination with SDL. MSCs
 are popular in Telecoms to specify how protocols operate.
 .
 mscgen can be used to create in-line MSC-charts in documentations
 parsed by doxygen. Extensions also exists for Python's Sphinx and
 mediawiki that can use mscgen.
