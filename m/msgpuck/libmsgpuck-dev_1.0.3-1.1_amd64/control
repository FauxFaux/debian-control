Description: MsgPack serialization library in a self-contained header file
 MsgPack is a binary-based efficient object serialization library.
 It enables to exchange structured objects between many languages like JSON.
 But unlike JSON, it is very fast and small.
 .
 msgpuck is very lightweight header-only library designed to be embedded to
 your application by the C/C++ compiler. The library is fully documented and
 covered by unit tests.
 .
 This package provides a self-contained header file and a static library.
 The static library contains generated code for inline functions and
 globals tables needed by the some library functions.
