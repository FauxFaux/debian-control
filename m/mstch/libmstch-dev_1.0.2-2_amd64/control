Description: Mustache implementation in C++11
 Mstch is a complete implementation of {{mustache}} templates using
 modern C++. It's compliant with specifications v1.1.3, including the
 lambda module.
 .
 Mustache is a logic-less template language. As such, it is very well
 suited for programs that are written in a compiled language, such as C
 and C++, as they cannot easily evaluate code found in a template.
 Mustache does however supports a simple conditional and a loop statement.
 .
 This package contains the header files and a static library.
