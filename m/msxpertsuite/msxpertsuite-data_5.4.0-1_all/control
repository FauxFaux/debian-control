Description: mass spectrometry software suite - arch-indep data
 msXpertSuite is a collection of programs to simulate and analyse mass
 spectrometric data obtained on linear (bio-)polymers. It is the
 successor of GNU polyXmass, first, and of massXpert, second.
 .
 This package contains the architecture-independent data required for
 the proper functioning of msxpertsuite. For example, polymer chemistry
 definition files are in this package, for use with the massxpert program.
