Description: mass spectrometry software suite - metapackage
 msXpertSuite provides programs to model linear (bio-) polymer
 chemistries, simulate mass spectral data, analyse and data-mine mass.
 It is the successor of GNU polyXmass, first, and then of massXpert.
 .
 The massXpert and mineXpert programs allow the following:
 .
 massXpert:
  - making brand new polymer chemistry definitions;
  - using the definitions to perform easy calculations in a desktop
    calculator-like manner;
  - performing sophisticated polymer sequence editing and simulations;
  - perform m/z list comparisons;
 .
  Chemical simulations encompass cleavage (either chemical or
  enzymatic), gas-phase fragmentations, chemical modification of any
  monomer in the polymer sequence, cross-linking of monomers in the
  sequence, arbitrary mass searches, calculation of the isotopic
  pattern...
 .
 mineXpert:
  - Open mass spectrometry data files (mzML, mzXML, asc, xy, ...);
  - Calculate and display the TIC chromatogram;
  - For mobility data, calculate and display a mz=f(dt) color map;
  - Integrate the data from the TIC chromatogram or color map
    - to mass spectrum;
    - to drift spectrum;
    - back to TIC chromatogram (XIC chromatogram);
    - reverse operations;
    - to single TIC intensity value
      (for mass spectral intensity comparisons);
  - Model centroids peaks into mass spectra using either the
    Gaussian model or the Lorentzian model;
  - Export the data to text files;
  - Slice a big initial file into smaller chunks for easier mining;
  - Define how mining activity is recorded on disk for later use;
  - Convert mzML files into a private (albeit open) mass spectrometry
    format that allows better performance (based on SQLite3).
 .
 This package depends on both massXpert and mineXpert packages and thus will
 install both of them. To install only one of the packages, install the
 corresponding msxpertsuite-massxpert or msxpertsuite-minexpert package.
