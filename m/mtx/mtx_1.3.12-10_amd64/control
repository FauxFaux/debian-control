Description: controls tape autochangers
 MTX can be used to manipulate tape auto-changers, also known as "jukeboxes",
 such that backup software can make use of the multiple tape capabilities of
 the auto-changer.  In particular, this is necessary glue for using a backup
 system like Amanda with a DDS auto-changer like the HP Surestore 12000e.
