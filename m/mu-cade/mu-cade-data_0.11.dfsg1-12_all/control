Description: physics centipede invasion - game data
 Mu-cade is another shoot-em-up game by Kenta Cho. In this game Kenta has
 introduced physics into his formula of hardcore shooting games. Similar
 in some ways to Asteroids and Nibbles, the playing area is a rectangular
 arena in which vessel-snakes have only one idea at the head: expelling
 the others into the vacuum. You incarnate one of them, and you'll quickly
 realize the subtlety of the goal: your tail lengthens as you destroy your
 enemies.
 .
 This package includes the architecture-independent data for the game Mu-cade.
