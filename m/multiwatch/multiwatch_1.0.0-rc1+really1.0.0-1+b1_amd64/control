Description: Forks and watches multiple instances of a program
 multiwatch forks multiple instance of one application and
 keeps them running.
 .
 It is made to be used with spawn-fcgi so all forks share the same
 fastcgi socket (no webserver restart needed if you increase/decrease
 the number of forks), and it is easier to setup than multiple
 daemontool or runit supervised instances.
