Description: Direct linear systems solver - parallel shared libraries
 MUMPS implements a direct solver for large sparse linear systems, with a
 particular focus on symmetric positive definite matrices.  It can
 operate on distributed matrices e.g. over a cluster.  It has Fortran and
 C interfaces, and can interface with ordering tools such as Scotch.
