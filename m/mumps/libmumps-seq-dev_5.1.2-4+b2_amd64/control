Description: Direct linear systems solver - non-parallel development files
 MUMPS implements a direct solver for large sparse linear systems, with a
 particular focus on symmetric positive definite matrices.  It can
 operate on distributed matrices e.g. over a cluster.  It has Fortran and
 C interfaces, and can interface with ordering tools such as Scotch.
 .
 This package is built the MUMPS libseq dummy sequential MPI library.
 Unless you know that you specifically need this, then you almost
 certainly want the libmumps-dev package.
