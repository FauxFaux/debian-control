Description: multicasts all channels of a DVB transponder on a network
 Mumudvb is a program that redistributes streams from DVB on a network
 using multicast. It is able to multicast a whole DVB transponder by
 assigning each channel a different multicast IP. It can operate
 Conditional Access Modules (CAM), and therefore works with encrypted
 streams. It has very low CPU and memory usage.
