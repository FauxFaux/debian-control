Description: authentication service for credential -- development package
 MUNGE (MUNGE Uid 'N' Gid Emporium) is an authentication service
 for creating and validating credentials.  It allows a process

 These hosts form a security realm that is defined by a shared
 cryptographic key.
 .
 This package contains the development files for compiling
 applications using MUNGE.
