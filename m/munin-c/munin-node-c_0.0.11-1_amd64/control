Description: C rewrite of Munin node
 Munin is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create graphs of
 virtually everything imaginable throughout your network, while still
 maintaining a rattling ease of installation and configuration.
 .
 This package contains a C rewrite of the daemon for the nodes being monitored.
 .
 The purpose for rewriting the daemon is the reduced resource usage specially
 when paired with the C rewrite of the core plugins.
