Description: network-wide graphing framework (plugins for node)
 Munin is a highly flexible and powerful solution used to create graphs of
 virtually everything imaginable throughout your network, while still
 maintaining a rattling ease of installation and configuration.
 .
 This package contains the official plugins for the Munin node, capable of
 extracting common values such as cpu usage, network usage, load average, and
 so on.
 .
 Creating your own plugins which are capable of extracting other system-specific
 values is very easy, and is often done in a matter of minutes.
 You can also create plugins which relay information from other devices in your
 network that can't run Munin, such as a switch or a server running another
 operating system, by using SNMP or similar technology.
 .
 Munin is written in Perl, and relies heavily on Tobi Oetiker's excellent
 RRDtool. To see a real example of Munin in action, you can follow a link
