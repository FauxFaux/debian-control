Description: Core routines of Munipack
 Munipack is a general astronomical photometry software package.
 Currently implements functions for standard photometry processing
 (photometry reductions - dark, flat), aperture  photometry, astrometry
 and photometry calibration, accessing Virtual observatory, etc.
 .
 This package contains the core routines. Ones are implemented in Fortran
 and partly in C++ as independent binaries. Data are provided via
 standard input and output. None additional dependency is required
 but direct usage should by hard.
