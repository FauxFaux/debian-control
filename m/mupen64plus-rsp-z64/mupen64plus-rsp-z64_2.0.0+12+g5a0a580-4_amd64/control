Description: low-level rsp emulation for mupen64plus
 N64 Reality Signal Processor instruction level emulation for graphics plugins
 supporting preprocessed vertex information. It can emulate even unknown or
 uncommon microcodes, but cannot benefit from faster implementation for the
 host cpu.
 .
 This package also provides mupen64plus-video-z64-hlevideo which can be used
 together with high level video emulation plugins like arachnoid, rice or
 glide64.
