Description: Arachnoid high-level graphics emulation for mupen64plus
 High-level graphics emulation plugin for known microcodes based on OpenGL, but
 works completely without vertex and pixel shaders. This makes it a good choice
 for older graphics hardware.
 .
 Arachnoid is based on a GPLv2+ fork of the glN64 source code.
