Description: minimalist RoarAudio client library (development headers)
 RoarAudio is a sound-server for audio mixing. Its main purpose is to mix audio
 from different clients before sending it to its outputs (for example a
 soundcard).
 .
 It is completely network transparent (UNIX sockets, TCP/IP and DECnet) and
 supports many common codecs like Ogg Vorbis, Speex or FLAC.
 .
 This is a minimalist client library for RoarAudio.
 It exists because it allows non-GPL applications to use
 the RoarAudio sound system.
 .
 This package contains the development headers for the libmuroar library.
