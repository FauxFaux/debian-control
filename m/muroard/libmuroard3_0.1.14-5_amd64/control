Description: minimalist RoarAudio sound daemon (library package)
 RoarAudio is a sound-server for audio mixing. Its main purpose is to mix audio
 from different clients before sending it to its outputs (for example a
 soundcard).
 .
 This package provides libraries needed to embed muRoarD into an existing
 application (as thread).
