Description: General SoundFont from MuseScore (full version)
 This is the new standard hard disc space-saving SF3 format
 soundfont as shipped with MuseScore 2.2 and newer.
 .
 MuseScore_General attempts to keep the installed-size footprint
 low while providing the complete GM (General MIDI) sound set
 and some extras, although its full version is larger than its
 antecessor fluidr3mono-gm-soundfont because of the new focus
 on improving quality. (The small version is, despite restoring
 stereo samples for some instruments, actually smaller, thanks
 to numerous optimisations and bugfixes.)
 .
 The musescore-general-soundfont package contains everything at
 best quality; musescore-general-soundfont-small is only a fourth
 the size (about the same as fluidr3mono-gm-soundfont) while being
 a drop-in replacement (identical bank configuration) at comparable
 quality to the full soundfont, missing only the separate ensembles
 (using identical samples for e.g. first/second violin) and some of
 the new larger instrument samples.
 .
 It can be used with most modern MIDI synthesisers which support
 the SF3 format, although early implementations (such as the one
 from MuseScore before release 2.2) had bugs making the resulting
 sound bad; instead use fluidr3mono-gm-soundfont for those.
 .
 As it comes under the MIT licence, it can be used in most settings,
 but do remember that waveforms generated using this soundfont are
 “copies or substantial portions of the” soundfont.
 .
 This package will be installed into /usr/share/sounds/sf3/ which
 is the standard Debian location for system-wide SF3 soundfonts.
