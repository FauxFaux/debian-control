Description: MuseScore SoundFont converter
 The sf3convert tool can be used to convert an SF2 SoundFont
 into SF3 format, or into C code for embedding into a binary.
 .
 The SF3 SoundFont format is the same as SF2, except it uses
 an OGG container instead of WAV for the patches contained
 in it. Current synthesisers, such as MuseScore and FluidSynth,
 expect the Vorbis codec to be used, which is lossy; hence, an
 SF3 SoundFont is considered to have a corresponding SF2 one
 as source, and to be compiled via this tool.
