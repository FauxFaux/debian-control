Description: Multi-Simulation Coordinator for MPI -- Development files
 MUSIC allows spike events and continuous time series to be
 communicated between parallel applications within the same MPI job in
 a cluster computer.  Typical usage cases are connecting models
 developed for different simulators and connecting a parallel
 simulator to a post-processing tool.
 .
 This package contains the header files which are needed to compile
 and link programs against libmusic.
