Description: A simple GUI tool to organize collections of music
 Music Librarian is a tool to assist you in organizing your collection
 of music files. It provides an interface from which you can view the
 list of files in your collection and modify the tags of one or more
 files.
 .
 Music Librarian handles ogg files natively, but also has support for
 the legacy mp3 format. It displays music in a hierarchical
 organization according to one of several rules, and allows you to
 undo any number of changes to files.
