Description: Simple but sophisticated graphical music player
 Musique unclutters your music listening experience with a clean and innovative
 interface. It comes with one playlist, plain and simple, but also
 with graphical display of your albums and artists using pictures downloaded
 from last.fm. At the same time you can, of course, also browse your music
 directories and files.
 .
 The use of an internal database makes musique pretty fast.
