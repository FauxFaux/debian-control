Description: simple tool that sorts a music collection
 Mussort is a useful tool for keeping large music collections in shape. It
 recursively searches a directory for MP3, Ogg Vorbis and FLAC files,
 processing them one by one. It then reads the information from the file and
 puts them into a newly sorted directory tree.
