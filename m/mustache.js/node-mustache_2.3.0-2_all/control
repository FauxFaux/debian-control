Description: Mustache rendering engine for Javascript - NodeJS
 Inspired by ctemplate, Mustache is a framework-agnostic way to render
 logic-free views. (As in model-view-controller.)
 .
 As ctemplates says, "It emphasizes separating logic from presentation:
 it is impossible to embed application logic in this template
 language."
 .
 This package provides the Mustache rendering engine for NodeJS, and the
 `mustache' command-line tool.
