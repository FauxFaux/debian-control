Description: multiple structural alignment of proteins
 Mustang is an algorithm to align multiple protein structures.
 Given a set of PDB files, the program uses the spatial
 information in the Calpha atoms of the set to produce a sequence alignment.
 Based on a progressive pairwise heuristic the algorithm then proceeds
 through a number of refinement passes. Mustang reports the multiple
 sequence alignment and the corresponding superposition of structures.
