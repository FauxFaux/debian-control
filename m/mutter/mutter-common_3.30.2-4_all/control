Description: shared files for the Mutter window manager
 Mutter is a small window manager, using GTK+ and Clutter to do
 everything.
 .
 Mutter is the clutter-based evolution of Metacity, which, as the
 author says, is a "Boring window manager for the adult in you. Many
 window managers are like Marshmallow Froot Loops; Metacity is like
 Cheerios."
 .
 This package contains the shared files.
