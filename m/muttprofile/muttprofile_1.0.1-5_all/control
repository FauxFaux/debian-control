Description: utility to choose profiles in Mutt
 A profile in Mutt is simply a specific subset of the configuration. You may
 have a personal and a work profile, each of which uses the same base
 configuration and then overrides specific configuration items like the email
 address.
 .
 muttprofile gives an easy way to switch between such profiles from within
 a running instance of Mutt. Quite simple and quite beautiful, and implemented
 in perl.
