Description: small XML parsing library (binaries)
 Mini-XML is a small XML parsing library that you can use to read XML and
 XML-like data files in your application without requiring large non-standard
 libraries.
 .
 Mini-XML provides the following functionality:
  * Reading of UTF-8 and UTF-16 and writing of UTF-8 encoded XML files and
    strings.
  * Data is stored in a linked-list tree structure, preserving the XML data
    hierarchy.
  * Supports arbitrary element names, attributes, and attribute values with
    no preset limits, just available memory.
  * Supports integer, real, opaque ("cdata"), and text data types in "leaf"
    nodes.
  * Functions for creating, indexing, and managing trees of data.
  * "Find" and "walk" functions for easily locating and navigating trees of
    data.
 .
  This package contains the Mini-XML development files.
