Description: small XML parsing library (runtime)
 Mini-XML is a small XML parsing library that you can use to read XML and
 XML-like data files in your application without requiring large non-standard
 libraries.
 .
 Mini-XML provides the following functionality:
  * Reading of UTF-8 and UTF-16 and writing of UTF-8 encoded XML files and
    strings.
  * Data is stored in a linked-list tree structure, preserving the XML data
    hierarchy.
  * Supports arbitrary element names, attributes, and attribute values with
    no preset limits, just available memory.
  * Supports integer, real, opaque ("cdata"), and text data types in "leaf"
    nodes.
  * Functions for creating, indexing, and managing trees of data.
  * "Find" and "walk" functions for easily locating and navigating trees of
    data.
 .
 Mini-XML doesn't do validation or other types of processing on the data based
 upon schema files or other sources of definition information, nor does it
 support character entities other than those required by the XML specification.
 .
 This package contains the files necessary for running applications that
 use the Mini-XML library.
