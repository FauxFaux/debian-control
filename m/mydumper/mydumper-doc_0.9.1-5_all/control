Description: High-performance MySQL backup tool - documentation
 Mydumper (aka. MySQL Data Dumper) is a high-performance multi-threaded
 backup (and restore) toolset for MySQL and Drizzle.  The main developers
 originally worked as Support Engineers at MySQL (one has moved to
 Facebook and another to SkySQL) and this is how they would envisage
 mysqldump based on years of user feedback.
