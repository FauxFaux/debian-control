Description: Set of utility classes used by Myghty templating
 Utility classes used by Myghty templating:
 container - the Containment system providing back-end neutral key/value
 storage, with support for in-memory, DBM files, flat files, and memcached.
 buffer - some functions for augmenting file objects .
 util - various utility functions and objects.
 synchronizer - provides many reader/single writer synchronization using
 either thread mutexes or lockfiles.
 session - provides a Session interface built upon the Container, similar
 interface to mod_python session. Currently needs a mod_python-like request
 object, this should be changed to something more generic.
