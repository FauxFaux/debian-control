Description: MyHDL cosimulation files
 MyHDL turns Python into a hardware description and verification language,
 providing hardware engineers with the power of the Python ecosystem.
 .
 Python can then be used as an event-driven simulator using Python decorators
 actively to specify what corresponds to 'processes' in Verilog / VHDL and
 thereby achieve concurrency.
 .
 This package provides the sources for executable extensions of the
 core modules.
