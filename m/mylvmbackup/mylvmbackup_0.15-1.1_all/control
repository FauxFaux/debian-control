Description: quickly creating backups of MySQL server's data files
 To perform a backup, mylvmbackup obtains a read lock on all tables and
 flushes all server caches to disk, makes an LVM snapshot of the volume
 containing the MySQL data directory, and unlocks the tables again. The
 snapshot process takes only a small amount of time. When it is done, the
 server can continue normal operations, while the actual file backup
 proceeds.
