Description: documentation for mypy
 Add type annotations to your Python programs, and use mypy to type check them.
 Mypy is essentially a Python linter on steroids, and it can catch many
 programming errors by analyzing your program, without actually having to run
 it. Mypy has a powerful type system with features such as type inference,
 gradual typing, generics and union types.

 This package provides the documentation.
