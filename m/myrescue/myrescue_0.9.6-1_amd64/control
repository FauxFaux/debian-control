Description: rescue data from damaged disks
 myrescue is a program to rescue the still-readable data from a damaged
 harddisk, CD-ROM, DVD, flash drives, etc. It is similar in purpose to
 dd_rescue (or ddrescue), but it tries to quickly get out of damaged
 areas to first handle the not yet damaged part of the disk and return
 later.
 .
 This package is useful to recover data from any media and for forensics
 investigations.
