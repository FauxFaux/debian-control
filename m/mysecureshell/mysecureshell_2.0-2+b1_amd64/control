Description: SFTP Server with ACL
 MySecureShell is a solution which has been made to bring more features to
 sftp/scp protocol given by OpenSSH. By default, OpenSSH brings a lot of
 liberty to connected users which imply to trust in your users.
 .
 The goal of MySecureShell is to offer the power and security of OpenSSH, with
 enhanced features (like ACL) to restrict connected users.
 .
 MySecureShell was created because of the lack of file transfer features in
 OpenSSH. OpenSSH was not designed as a file transfer solution, that's why
 MySecureShell is born.
 .
 MySecureShell is not a patch for OpenSSH, it's a shell for users.
 It has the advantage to:
  * Avoid including security holes in OpenSSH
  * No dependency on against an OpenSSH version
  * No OpenSSH recompilation is required
