Description: MySQL regression tests
 This is an empty package that depends on the current "best" version of
 mysql-testsuite (currently mysql-testsuite-5.7), as determined by the
 MySQL maintainers.  Install this package if in doubt about which MySQL
 version you want, as this is the one we consider to be in the best shape.
