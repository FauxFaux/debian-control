Description: pure Python implementation of MySQL Client/Server protocol
 MySQL driver written in Python which does not depend on MySQL C client
 libraries and implements the DB API v2.0 specification (PEP-249).
 .
 MySQL Connector/Python is implementing the MySQL Client/Server protocol
 completely in Python. This means you don't have to compile anything or MySQL
 (client library) doesn't even have to be installed on the machine.
