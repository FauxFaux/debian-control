Description: real-time logging system in MySQL - Postfix traffic-logger
 MySQMail is a set of tiny daemon loggers for mail and FTP servers that
 save traffic information in a MySQL database. The information is split
 by domain and by user so that it's easy to measure all the traffic for
 a given domain name in real time.
 .
 This package provides a logger for SMTP traffic handled by Postfix.
