Description: userspace filesystem client for MythTV
 mythtvfs implements a human-readable filesystem on top of an existing
 MythTV tree. It communicates with the MythTV backend to fill in the
 recording details, so that recordings can be browsed easily with applications
 that do not natively communicate with MythTV backends.
 .
 mythtvfs is based on FUSE (userspace filesystem framework for Linux),
 thus you will have to prepare the fuse kernel module to be able to use it.
