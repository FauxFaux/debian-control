Description: NaCl and CurveCP tools
 NaCl (pronounced "salt") is a new easy-to-use high-speed
 software library for network communication, encryption,
 decryption, signatures, etc. NaCl's goal is to provide
 all of the core operations needed to build higher-level
 cryptographic tools. Tools include basic programs to
 deploy CurveCP message-handling.
