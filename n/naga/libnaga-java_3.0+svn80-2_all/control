Description: Simplified Java NIO asynchronous sockets
 Naga aims to be a very small NIO library that provides a handful of java
 classes to wrap the usual Socket and ServerSocket with asynchronous NIO
 counterparts.
 .
 All of this is driven from a single thread, making it useful for both client
 (e.g. allowing I/O to be done in the AWT-thread without any need for threads)
 and server programming (1 thread for all connections instead of 2
 threads/connection).
 .
 Naga contains the code needed to get NIO up and running without having to code
 partially read buffers and setting various selection key flags.
