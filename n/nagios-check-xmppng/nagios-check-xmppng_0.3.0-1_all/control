Description: monitoring plugin to check XMPP servers
 a nagios compatible check plugin for XMPP servers implementing the XMPP
 protocol as specified in RFC 6120.
 .
 The plugin provides the following features:
 .
   - check client to server (C2S) as well as server to server (S2S) ports
   - check XMPP servers on IPv6 and IPv4 addresses
   - support STARTTLS as specified in RFC 6120 section 5.
   - check the validity of the server certificate presented by the XMPP server
 .
 The plugin has been implemented because of insufficiencies in the existing
 check_ssl_cert and check_xmpp plugins.
