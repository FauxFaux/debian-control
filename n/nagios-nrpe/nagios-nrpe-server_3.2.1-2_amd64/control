Description: Nagios Remote Plugin Executor Server
 Nagios is a host/service/network monitoring and management system.
 .
 The purpose of this addon is to allow you to execute Nagios plugins on a
 remote host in as transparent a manner as possible.
 .
 This program runs as a background process on the remote host and processes
 command execution requests from the check_nrpe plugin on the Nagios host.
