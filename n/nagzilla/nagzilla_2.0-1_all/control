Description: jabber relay bot
 Nagzilla was designed to be a Jabber relay "bot" in that it sits quietly in a
 room until it gets a message to relay to either a chatroom or a person. It is
 split into two programs:
  * nagzillad - the daemon that sits in the room and sends the messages, and
  * nagzillac - the client that gets the messages and hands them to the daemon
