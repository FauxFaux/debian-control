Description: client, protocol, and server for running Java programs from CLI
 Nailgun is a client, protocol, and server for running Java programs from
 the command line without incurring the JVM startup overhead. Programs run
 in the server (which is implemented in Java), and are triggered by the
 client (written in C), which handles all I/O.
