Description: static site generator written in Ruby
 Nanoc is a static site generator, fit for building anything from a small
 personal blog to a large corporate web site. It can transform content
 from one format (e.g. Haml or Markdown) into another (usually HTML) and
 lay out pages so that the site's look and feel is consistent across all
 pages.
 .
 Extending Nanoc is easy because of its modular architecture. It comes
 with only a couple of extensions, but allows new functionality to be
 plugged in quickly and easily.
 .
 Some knowledge of the Ruby programming language is required in order to use
 Nanoc.
