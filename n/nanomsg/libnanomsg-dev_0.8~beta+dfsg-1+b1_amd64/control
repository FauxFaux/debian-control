Description: nanomsg development files
 nanomsg is a socket library that provides several common
 communication patterns. It aims to make the networking layer fast,
 scalable, and easy to use. Implemented in C, it works on a wide range
 of operating systems with no further dependencies.
 .
 The communication patterns, also called "scalability protocols", are
 basic blocks for building distributed systems. By combining them you
 can create a vast array of distributed applications. The following
 scalability protocols are currently available:
 .
    PAIR - simple one-to-one communication
    BUS - simple many-to-many communication
    REQREP - allows one to build clusters of stateless services
             to process user requests
    PUBSUB - distributes messages to large sets of interested subscribers
    PIPELINE - aggregates messages from multiple sources and
               load balances them among many destinations
    SURVEY - allows one to query state of multiple applications in a single go
 .
 This package contains the development files for nanomsg.
