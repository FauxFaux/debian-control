Description: Network Audio System - shared libraries
 The Network Audio System (NAS) was developed by NCD for playing,
 recording, and manipulating audio data over a network. Like the X
 Window System, it uses the client/server model to separate
 applications from the specific drivers that control audio input and
 output devices.
 .
 This package contains the NAS library (libaudio), needed for both remote
 and local output.
