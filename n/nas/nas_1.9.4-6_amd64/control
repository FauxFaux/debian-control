Description: Network Audio System - local server
 The Network Audio System (NAS) was developed by NCD for playing,
 recording, and manipulating audio data over a network. Like the X
 Window System, it uses the client/server model to separate
 applications from the specific drivers that control audio input and
 output devices.
 .
 This package contains the NAS daemon (nasd), needed for local output
 from NAS.
