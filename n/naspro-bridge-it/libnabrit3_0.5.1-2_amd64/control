 NASPRO Bridge it is a little helper library to develop insert-your-API-here
 to LV2 bridges.

 serialization for LV2 dynamic manifest generation, supporting the
 following LV2 specifications/extensions:
  * LV2 revision 4.0;
  * LV2 Dynamic Manifest revision 1.0;
  * Extended Port Information draft revision 3 (only for the logarithmic port
    property);
  * LV2 Events revision 1.0;

 It is written in C99 and is almost entirely reentrant and thread-safe.
