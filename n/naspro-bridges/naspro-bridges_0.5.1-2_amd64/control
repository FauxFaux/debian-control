Description: collection of bridges to LV2
 NASPRO bridges is a collection of bridges to LV2 which, once installed,
 allow users to use plugins developed for other plugin standards in LV2
 hosts.
 .
 This release contains two such bridges: a LADSPA (+ LRDF) and a
 DSSI one.
 .
 The LADSPA bridge supports every feature of LADSPA and LRDF except:
  * run_adding() and set_run_adding_gain().
  * LRDF factory presets.
 The DSSI bridge does not support:
  * GUIs;
  * MIDI programs;
  * maximum number of events per run_synth() - it is 4096, should be
    enough in most cases;
  * run_synth_adding() - as before;
  * run_multiple_synths() and run_multiple_synths_adding() - no
    extension to do that and it may also be impossible to support
    those.
