Description: Extension for Nautilus to hide files without renaming them
 Nautilus Hide is a simple Python extension for the Nautilus file manager
 that adds options to the right-click menu to hide or unhide files.
 .
 The extension hides the files without renaming them (i.e. without prefixing
 a dot ('.') or suffixing a tilde ('~')). It does that by adding their
 names to the folder's '.hidden' file, which Nautilus reads to hide the
 listed files the next time you open or refresh the folder.
