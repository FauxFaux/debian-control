Description: simple tool for nautilus scripts management
 nautilus-scripts-manager is a small and easy to use application which allows
 any user to activate, deactivate or just see Nautilus scripts installed in the
 system.
 .
 Nautilus scripts are just ordinary scripts which, once activated, can be ran
 directly from the right-click menu in the popular GNOME files manager.
 .
 This program can be used through its intuitive graphical interface or with a
 set of command line options. In particular, it can transparently replace the
 command line utility nautilus-script-manager (notice the missing "s").
 .
 Once installed, it will appear among the user settings utilities (usually in
 the "Preferences" menu).
