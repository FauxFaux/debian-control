Description: Car navigation system with routing engine - internal GUI
 Navit is a car navigation system with routing engine.
 .
 Its modular design is capable of using vector maps of various formats for
 routing and rendering of the displayed map. It's even possible to use multiple
 maps at a time.

 The GTK+ or SDL user interfaces are designed to work well with touch screen
 displays. Points of Interest of various formats are displayed on the map.

 The routing engine not only calculates an optimal route to your destination,
 but also generates directions and even speaks to you using speech-dispatcher.
