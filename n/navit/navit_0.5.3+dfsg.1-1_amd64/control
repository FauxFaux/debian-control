Description: Car navigation system with routing engine
 Navit is a car navigation system with routing engine.
 .
 Its modular design is capable of using vector maps of various formats for
 routing and rendering of the displayed map. It's even possible to use multiple
 maps at a time.
 .
 The GTK+ or SDL user interfaces are designed to work well with touch screen
 displays. Points of Interest of various formats are displayed on the map.
 .
 The current vehicle position is either read from gpsd or directly from NMEA
 GPS sensors.
 .
 The routing engine not only calculates an optimal route to your destination,
 but also generates directions and even speaks to you using speech-dispatcher.
 .
 The Debian packaging for navit doesn't provide any map. To see, where you can
 get maps from, see <http://wiki.navit-project.org/index.php/Main_Page#Maps>.
