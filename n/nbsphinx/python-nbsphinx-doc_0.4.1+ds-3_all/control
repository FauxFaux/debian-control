Description: Jupyter Notebook Tools for Sphinx -- doc
 nbsphinx is a Sphinx extension that provides a source parser for *.ipynb
 files. Custom Sphinx directives are used to show Jupyter Notebook code cells
 (and of course their results) in both HTML and LaTeX output.
 Un-evaluatednotebooks, i.e., notebooks without stored output cells, will be
 automatically executed during the Sphinx build process.
 .
 This is the common documentation package.
