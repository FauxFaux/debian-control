Description: network capture library
 ncap is a network capture library like libpcap (on which it is based)
 and tcpdump. It produces binary data in its own ncap format, which can
 be stored in a dump file or transmitted over a UDP socket. Unlike
 libpcap, it discards data link headers and only supports IPv4 and IPv6
 packets, but it can perform reassembly of IP datagrams.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
