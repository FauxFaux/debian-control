Description: libraries for using data in the INSDC Sequence Read Archives (devel)
 Much of the data submitted these days, for example in BAM, Illumina
 export.txt, and Complete Genomics formats, contain alignment
 information. With aligned data, NCBI uses Compression by Reference,
 which only stores the differences in base pairs between sequence data
 and the segment it aligns to. The process to restore original data, for
 example as FastQ, requires fast access to the reference sequences that
 the original data was aligned to. NCBI recommends that SRA users
 dedicate local disk space to store references downloaded from the NCBI
 SRA site. As of Fall 2014, the complete collection of these reference
 sequences is 66 GB. While it isn't usually necessary to download the
 entirety of the reference sequences, this should give you an idea of the
 scale of the storage requirement. By default, the Toolkit will download
 missing reference sequences on demand and cache them in the user's home
 directory. The location of this cache is configurable, as is whether the
 download is automatic or manual.

 This is the development package.
