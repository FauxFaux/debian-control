Description: libraries for using data in the INSDC Sequence Read Archives
 NGS is a new, domain-specific API for accessing reads, alignments and
 pileups produced from Next Generation Sequencing. The API itself is
 independent from any particular back-end implementation, and supports
 use of multiple back-ends simultaneously. It also provides a library for
 building new back-end "engines". The engine for accessing SRA data is
 contained within the sister repository ncbi-vdb.
 .
 The API is currently expressed in C++, Java and Python languages. The
 design makes it possible to maintain a high degree of similarity between
 the code in one language and code in another - especially between C++
 and Java.
