Description: virtual layer update modul of ncbi-vdb library
 NGS is a new, domain-specific API for accessing reads, alignments and
 pileups produced from Next Generation Sequencing. The API itself is
 independent from any particular back-end implementation, and supports
 use of multiple back-ends simultaneously. It also provides a library for
 building new back-end "engines". The engine for accessing SRA data is
 contained within the sister repository ncbi-vdb.
 .
 This library is part of the ncbi-vdb package.
