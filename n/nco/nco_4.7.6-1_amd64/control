Description: Command-line operators to analyze netCDF files
 NCO is a suite of programs known as operators. The operators are stand-alone,
 command-line programs executable in a POSIX shell. Operators take one or more
 netCDF files as input, perform operations (e.g., averaging, hyperslabbing),
 and produce a netCDF output file. NCO was originally designed to manipulate and
 analyze climate data, though it works on any netCDF format datasets.
