Description: original Lempel-Ziv compress/uncompress programs
 This package provides the original compress and uncompress programs that used
 to be the de facto UNIX standard for compressing and uncompressing files.
 These programs implement a fast, simple Lempel-Ziv (LZW) file compression
 algorithm.
 .
 For Debian, the standard uncompress program is installed as uncompress.real,
 to avoid conflicting with other packages.
 .
 This package also contains a copyright notice and a brief discussion of the
 LZW patent history (written by one of the original authors) in the file
 /usr/share/doc/ncompress/README.Debian.
