Description: test programs and examples for ncurses
 The ncurses library routines are a terminal-independent method of
 updating character screens with reasonable optimization.
 .
 This package contains programs demonstrating the possibilities of
 ncurses and testing the library. The examples include an
 analog/digital clock and several classic programs such as solitaire,
 battleships, a knight's tour on a chess board, the towers of Hanoi
 and several others.
