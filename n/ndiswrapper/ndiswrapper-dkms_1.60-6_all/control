Description: Source for the ndiswrapper Linux kernel module (DKMS)
 Some vendors do not release specifications of the hardware or provide a
 Linux driver for their wireless network cards. This project implements
 Windows kernel API and NDIS (Network Driver Interface Specification) API
 within Linux kernel. A Windows driver for wireless network card is then
 linked to this implementation so that the driver runs natively, as though
 it is in Windows, without binary emulation.
 .
 This package provides the source code for ndiswrapper kernel module to be
 build with dkms.
