Description: Translation of the NEC2 FORTRAN source code to the C language
 The translation was performed mostly "by hand" and a lot of modifications
 to the original program were introduced in order to modernize the NEC2
 and to remove as many built-in limitations as possible. The attendant
 SOMNEC program was also translated to C and incorporated in nec2c as a
 function so that Sommerfeld ground solutions are a part of the program.
