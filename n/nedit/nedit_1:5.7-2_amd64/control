Description: powerful, customizable, Motif based text editor
 NEdit is a multi-purpose text editor for the X Window System, which
 combines a standard, easy to use, graphical user interface with the
 thorough functionality and stability required by users who edit text
 eight hours a day. It provides intensive support for development in
 a wide variety of languages, text processors, and other tools, but
 at the same time can be used productively by just about anyone who
 needs to edit text.
 .
 Because of its mature age, NEdit does not support UTF-8 text files,
 nor will that be implemented.
