Description: Lightweight virtual machine - headers
 Neko provides a common runtime for several different languages,
 including JavaScript and haXe.
 .
 The virtual machine is both very lightweight and well optimized.  It
 can be easily embedded into other applications, and libraries are
 directly accessible using the C foreign function interface.
 .
 This package includes the header files for development using the Neko
 virtual machine.
 .
 Neko was written by Nicolas Cannasse.
