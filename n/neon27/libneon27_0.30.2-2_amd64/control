Description: HTTP and WebDAV client library
 neon is an HTTP and WebDAV client library, with a C language API.
 .
 WARNING: THE NEON API IS NOT YET STABLE.
 .
 Provides lower-level interfaces to directly implement new HTTP
 methods, and higher-level interfaces so that you don't have to
 worry about the lower-level stuff.
 .
 Current features:
   * High-level interface to HTTP and WebDAV methods (PUT, GET, HEAD, etc.)
   * Low-level interface to HTTP request handling, to allow implementing
     new methods easily.
   * persistent connections
   * RFC2617 basic and digest authentication (including auth-int, md5-sess)
   * Proxy support (including basic/digest authentication)
   * SSL/TLS support using OpenSSL (including client certificate and thread
     safety support)
   * Generic WebDAV 207 XML response handling mechanism
   * XML parsing using the expat or libxml parsers
   * Easy generation of error messages from 207 error responses
   * WebDAV resource manipulation: MOVE, COPY, DELETE, MKCOL.
   * WebDAV metadata support: set and remove properties, query any set ofi
     properties (PROPPATCH/PROPFIND).
   * autoconf macros supplied for easily embedding neon directly inside an
     application source tree.
