Description: web shell code detection
 NeoPI is a Python script that uses a variety of statistical methods to detect
 obfuscated and encrypted content within text/script files.
 .
 The intended purpose of NeoPI is to aid in the detection of hidden web shell
 code.
 .
 The development focus of NeoPI was creating a tool that could be used in
 conjunction with other established detection methods such as Linux Malware
 Detect or traditional signature/keyword based searches.
 .
 NeoPI recursively scans through the file system from a base directory and will
 rank files based on the results of a number of tests. It also presents a
 "general" score derived from file rankings within the individual tests.
