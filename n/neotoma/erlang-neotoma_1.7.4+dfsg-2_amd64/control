Description: parser generator for Erlang
 Neotoma is a packrat parser-generator for Erlang for Parsing
 Expression Grammars (PEGs). It consists of a parsing-combinator
 library with memoization routines, a parser for PEGs, and a utility
 to generate parsers from PEGs.  It is inspired by treetop, a Ruby
 library with similar aims, and parsec, the parser-combinator library
 for Haskell.
 .
 Features include:
  - Simple, declarative parsers generated from even simpler grammars.
  - Fully integrated, single-pass lexical and syntactic analysis (a
    feature of PEGs).
  - Packrat-style memoization, boasting parse-time bound linearly to
    the input size (at the expense of memory usage).
  - In-place semantic analysis/transformation, supporting single-pass
    end-to-end in some applications.
  - Erlang code-generation for the lexical/syntactic analysis piece,
    with the option of semantic analysis/transformation inline, or in
    a separate module.
  - Line/column number tracking for easy resolution of parsing
    errors.
