Description: remotely determine DNS server version
 A nameserver basically responds to a query. Interoperability is an
 obvious requirement here. The standard protocol behaviour of different
 DNS implementations is expected to be the same.
 .
 The reality is quite different though. fpdns uses a series of borderline
 DNS queries to determine the vendor, product and version of a nameserver.
