Description: library to determine DNS server vendor, product and version
 Identifying individual nameserver implementations is based on "borderline"
 protocol behaviour. The DNS protocol offers a multitude of message bits,
 response types, opcodes, classes, query types and label types in a fashion
 that makes some mutually exclusive while some are not used in a query
 messages at all.
 .
 Not every implementation offers the full set of features the DNS protocol
 set currently has. Some implementations offer features outside the protocol
 set, and there are implementations that do not conform to standards.
 .
 Amongst the servers it is able to identify are:
 .
