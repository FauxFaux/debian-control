Description: SNMP configuration script, MIBs and documentation
 The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) provides a framework
 for the exchange of management information between agents (servers)
 and clients.
 .
 This package includes documentation and MIBs (Management Information Bases)
 for the SNMP libraries, agents and applications. MIBs contain a formal
 description of the data that can be managed using SNMP and applications.
 .
 NOTE: If you want the OIDs (Object Identifiers) to resolve to their text
 description, you need to activate the non-free repository and install the
 "snmp-mibs-downloader" package.
