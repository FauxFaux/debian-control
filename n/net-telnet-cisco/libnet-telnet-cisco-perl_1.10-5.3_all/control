Description: Additional functionality to automate Cisco management
 Net::Telnet::Cisco provides additional functionality to
 Net::Telnet for dealing with Cisco routers. It provides a new
 object that allows for remote management of routers through perl
 issuing commands like you were connected directly to the router
 (or switch).
 .
 For most management issues you might want to use the Net::SNMP
 module better (it's faster, better error handling and doesn't use
 up router virtual terminals) but for those things you can not do
 using that module use this one.
