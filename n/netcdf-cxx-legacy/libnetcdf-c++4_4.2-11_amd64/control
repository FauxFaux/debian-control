Description: legacy NetCDF C++ interface
 NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is an interface for scientific
 data access and a freely-distributed software library that provides an
 implementation of the interface.  The netCDF library also defines a
 machine-independent format for representing scientific data.
 Together, the interface, library, and format support the creation,
 access, and sharing of scientific data.
 .
 This version of the netCDF C++ library is provided for backwards compatibility
 as a separate package. It was developed before key C++ concepts like templates,
 namespaces, and exceptions were widely supported. It's not recommended for new
 projects, but it still works. This version of the C++ interface only supports
 the "classic" data model from the netCDF-3 release.
 .
 This package contains the legacy C++ shared libraries.
