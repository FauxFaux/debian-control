Description: legacy NetCDF C++ interface - development files
 NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a set of interfaces for array-oriented
 data access and a freely distributed collection of data access libraries for
 C, Fortran, C++, Java, and other languages. The netCDF libraries support a
 machine-independent format for representing scientific data. Together, the
 interfaces, libraries, and format support the creation, access, and sharing of
 scientific data.
 .
 This version of the netCDF C++ library is provided for backwards compatibility
 as a separate package. It was developed before key C++ concepts like templates,
 namespaces, and exceptions were widely supported. It's not recommended for new
 projects, but it still works. This version of the C++ interface only supports
 the "classic" data model from the netCDF-3 release.
 .
 This package contains headers for the legacy C++ library.
