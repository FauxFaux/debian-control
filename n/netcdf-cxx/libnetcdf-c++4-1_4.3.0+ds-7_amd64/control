Description: C++ interface for scientific data access to large binary data
 NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is an interface for scientific
 data access and a freely-distributed software library that provides an
 implementation of the interface.  The netCDF library also defines a
 machine-independent format for representing scientific data.
 Together, the interface, library, and format support the creation,
 access, and sharing of scientific data.
 .
 This package contains the C++ shared library.
