Description: creation, access, and sharing of scientific data in Fortran
 NetCDF (network Common Data Form) is a set of interfaces for array-oriented
 data access and a freely distributed collection of data access libraries for
 C, Fortran, C++, Java, and other languages. The netCDF libraries support a
 machine-independent format for representing scientific data. Together, the
 interfaces, libraries, and format support the creation, access, and sharing of
 scientific data.
 .
 This package contains headers for the Fortran library.
