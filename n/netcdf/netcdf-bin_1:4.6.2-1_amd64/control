Description: Programs for reading and writing NetCDF files
 Contains the programs ncdump and ncgen which convert NetCDF
 files to ASCII and back, respectively. NetCDF (network Common Data
 Form) is an interface for scientific data access and a
 freely-distributed software library that provides an implementation
 of the interface.  The netCDF library also defines a
 machine-independent format for representing scientific data.
 Together, the interface, library, and format support the creation,
 access, and sharing of scientific data.
