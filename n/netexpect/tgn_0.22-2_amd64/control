Description: A command-line based network traffic generator
 TGN (Traffic GeNerator) is a command-line based network traffic
 generator that allows to easily craft and inject network traffic.
 It has the same packet crafting and injection capabilities provided
 by the Network Expect framework but does not have the bigger
 dependencies that Network Expect has. The Protocol Data Unit (PDU)
 to send is defined in a simple way, without the use of complicated
 command-line switches that are hard to remember.
 .
 A TGN invokation may look like:
 .
 shell# tgn "ip(proto = 0..255, src = 'random', dst = 192.168.1.1)/icmp-echo()"
 .
