Description: Emacs major-mode for playing NetHack
 Nethack is a wonderfully silly, yet quite addicting, Dungeons and
 Dragons-style adventure game. You play the part of a fierce fighter,
 wizard, or any of many other classes, fighting your way down to
 retrieve the Amulet of Yendor (try saying THAT one backwards!) for
 your god.  On the way, you might encounter a quantum mechanic or two,
 or perhaps a microscopic space fleet, or -- if you're REALLY lucky --
 the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.
 .
