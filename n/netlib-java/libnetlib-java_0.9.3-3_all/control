Description: collection of mission-critical software components for linear algebra systems
 Netlib is a collection of mission-critical software components for linear
 algebra systems (i.e. working with vectors or matrices).
 .
 Netlib libraries are written in C, Fortran or optimised assembly code.
 This package provides a Java translation but it does not take advantage of
 optimised system libraries.
