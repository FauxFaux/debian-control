Description: Network performance benchmark
 Netperf is a benchmark that can be used to measure the performance of many
 different types of networking. It provides tests for both unidirecitonal
 throughput, and end-to-end latency. The environments currently measureable by
 netperf include:
  * TCP and UDP via BSD Sockets
  * DLPI
  * Unix Domain Sockets
  * IPv6
