Description: Network Performance Meter (plotting program)
 NetPerfMeter is a network performance meter for the UDP,
 TCP, MPTCP, SCTP and DCCP transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6.
 It simultaneously transmits bidirectional flows to an endpoint
 and measures the resulting flow bandwidths and QoS. The
 results are written as vector and scalar files. The vector
 files can e.g. be used to create plots of the results.
 .
 This package contains a plotting program for the results.
