Description: manipulate BSD TCP/IP stream sockets
 The netpipes package makes TCP/IP streams usable in shell
 scripts. It can also simplify client/server code by allowing
 the programmer to skip all the tedious programming bits related
 to sockets and concentrate on writing a filter, or other service.
