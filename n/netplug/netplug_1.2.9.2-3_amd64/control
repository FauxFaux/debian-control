Description: network link monitor daemon
 This daemon monitors the link status of network cards and configures
 the network on plug- and un-plug-events.
 .
 It's similar to ifplugd, but uses NETLINK instead of regularly polling
 the link status. This improves power-consumption with laptops, but does
 not work with all network card. And it can't be configured to ignore short
 unplugged or plugged periods like ifplugd.
