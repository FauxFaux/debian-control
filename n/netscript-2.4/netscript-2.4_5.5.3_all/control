Description: Linux 2.4/2.6/3.x router/firewall/VM host network config system.
 This is a router and firewall network configuration system.  It is specific to
 the 2.4.x and 2.6.x kernel series. This system is in production use, even
 though this is an experimental version.
 .
 It offers much finer grained control of the network setup than the standard
 system in netbase, with support for bridge configuration, iptables, ip route
 and tc traffic control.  It is optimised for use on high traffic routers with
 interfaces being reconfigured individually while the rest of the machine is
 routing traffic 24x7.  Common boiler plate filter creation functions are
 provided to ease the task of constructing iptables filters in the context
 of operation within an ISP network.
 .
 Since this package is designed for a heavy duty network router, it is designed
 to work in conjunction with a routing daemon as found in the quagga package.
 .
 DON'T use this on a pure server - it is VERY useful for a Virtual Machine
 server with complex networking needs.  This is because of its comprehensive
 network configuration capabilities.  Thus it is a tempting replacement
 when you have to rip out NetworkManager on a server.
 .
 It was originally designed for dedicated routers and firewalls, and hence its
 lightweight scripting footprint. When it comes to firewall configuration
 though, have a look at the mason package if you are faint of heart.
