Description: Linux 2.6/3.x iptables management system.
 This is a cut down version of netscript-2.4, which is just the ipfilter
 iptables/ip6tables management implementation.  This provides iptables and
 ip6tables management with a cyclic backup history, via iptables-restore
 and iptables-save.
 .
 This is designed to work with ifupdown, and is better than iptables-persistent
 as you can roll back filter changes if you have made a mistake.
