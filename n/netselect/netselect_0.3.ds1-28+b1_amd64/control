Description: speed tester for choosing a fast network server
 This package provides a utility that can perform parallelized
 tests on distant servers using either UDP traceroutes or ICMP queries.
 .
 It can process a (possibly very long) list of servers, and choose the
 fastest/closest one automatically.
