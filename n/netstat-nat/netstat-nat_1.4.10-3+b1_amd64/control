Description: tool that display NAT connections
 Netstat-nat is a program that displays Network Address Translations (NAT)
 connections, managed by netfilter/iptables acting as firewall.
 .
 NAT rules are stored in memory. However, the program reads its information
 from '/proc/net/ip_conntrack', which is the temporary conntrack-storage of
 netfilter.
