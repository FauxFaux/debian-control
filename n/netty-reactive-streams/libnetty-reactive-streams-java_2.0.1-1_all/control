Description: Netty Reactive Streams
 This library provides a reactive streams implementation for Netty.
 Essentially it comes in the form of two channel handlers, one that
 publishes inbound messages received on a channel to a Publisher,
 and another that writes messages received by a Subscriber outbound.
 .
 Features include:
  * Full backpressure support, as long as the AUTO_READ channel option
    is disabled.
  * Publishers/subscribers can be dynamically added and removed from
    the pipeline.
  * Multiple publishers/subscribers can be inserted into the pipeline.
  * Customisable cancel/complete/failure handling.
