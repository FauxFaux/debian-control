Description: Dispatcher service for systemd-networkd connection status changes
 Networkd-dispatcher is a dispatcher daemon for systemd-networkd
 connection status changes. It is similar to NetworkManager-dispatcher,
 but is much more limited in the types of events it supports due to the
 limited nature of systemd-networkd.
