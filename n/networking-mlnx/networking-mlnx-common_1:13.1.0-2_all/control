Description: OpenStack virtual network service - Mellanox plugin common files
 Neutron provides an API to dynamically request and configure virtual networks.

 vNICs from Nova VMs). The Neutron API supports extensions to provide advanced
 network capabilities, including QoS, ACLs, and network monitoring.
