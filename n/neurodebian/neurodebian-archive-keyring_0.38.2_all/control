Description: neuroscience-oriented distribution - GnuPG archive keys
 The NeuroDebian project integrates and maintains a variety of software
 projects within Debian that are useful for neuroscience (such as AFNI,
 FSL, PsychoPy, etc.) or generic computation (such as HTCondor,
 pandas, etc.).
 .
 The NeuroDebian project digitally signs its Release files. This package
 contains the archive keys used for that.
