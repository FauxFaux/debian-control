Description: Neuron simulation environment - Python bindings
 NEURON is a simulation environment for modeling individual neurons and networks
 of neurons. It provides tools for conveniently building, managing, and using
 models in a way that is numerically sound and computationally efficient. It is
 particularly well-suited to problems that are closely linked to experimental
 data, especially those that involve cells with complex anatomical and
 biophysical properties.
 .
 This package contains Python bindings for NEURON.
