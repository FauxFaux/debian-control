Description: Loadbalancer-as-a-Service driver for OpenStack networking - Agent
 Neutron provides an API to dynamically request and configure virtual networks.
 These networks connect "interfaces" from other OpenStack services (such as
 vNICs from Nova VMs). The Neutron API supports extensions to provide advanced
 network capabilities, including QoS, ACLs, and network monitoring.

 This package provides the LBaaS agent.
