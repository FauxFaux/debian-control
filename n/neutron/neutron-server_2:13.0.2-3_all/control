Description: OpenStack virtual network service - metapackage for the server
 Neutron provides an API to dynamically request and configure virtual networks.
 These networks connect "interfaces" from other OpenStack services (such as
 vNICs from Nova VMs). The Neutron API supports extensions to provide advanced
 network capabilities, including QoS, ACLs, and network monitoring.
 .
 As the Debian packages switched to Python 3, it isn't possible to run using
 Eventlet (ie: the standalone neutron-server daemon) if we use SSL, because of
 defects in python3-eventlet. So the Debian package maitainer decided to switch
 to uwsgi instead. In this mode, one needs to also run neutron-rpc-server to
 listen for requests on the message bus (ie: rabbitmq in most cases). For this
 reason, the neutron-server package has been split into neutron-api and
 neutron-rpc-server.
