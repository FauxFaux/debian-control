Description: matrix manipulations library (C++ headers files)
 Newmat library is intended for scientists and engineers
 who need to manipulate a variety of types of matrices
 using standard matrix operations.
 Emphasis is on the kind of operations needed in statistical calculations
 such as least squares, linear equation solve and eigenvalues.
 .
 Newmat supports matrix types: Matrix (rectangular matrix);
 UpperTriangularMatrix; LowerTriangularMatrix; DiagonalMatrix;
 SymmetricMatrix; BandMatrix; UpperBandMatrix; LowerBandMatrix;
 SymmetricBandMatrix; IdentityMatrix;
 RowVector; ColumnVector.
 .
 Only one element type (float or double) is supported (default is double).
 .
 The library includes the operations *, +, -, *=, +=, -=, Kronecker product,
 Schur product, concatenation, inverse, transpose, conversion between types,
 submatrix, determinant, Cholesky decomposition, QR triangularisation,
 singular value decomposition, eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix, sorting,
 fast Fourier and trig. transforms and printing.
 .
 libnewmat-dev contains static libraries, headers, and some documentation.
