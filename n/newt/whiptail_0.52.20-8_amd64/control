Description: Displays user-friendly dialog boxes from shell scripts
 Whiptail is a "dialog" replacement using newt instead of ncurses. It
 provides a method of displaying several different types of dialog boxes
 from shell scripts. This allows a developer of a script to interact with
 the user in a much friendlier manner.
