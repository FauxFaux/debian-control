Description: high-performance JSON framework for .NET -- NuGet package
 Json.NET is a high-performance JSON framework for .NET. It has the following
 features:
  - Flexible JSON serializer for converting between .NET objects and JSON
  - LINQ to JSON for manually reading and writing JSON
  - High performance, faster than .NET's build-in JSON serializers
  - Write indented, easy to read JSON
  - Convert JSON to and from XML
 .
 The JSON serializer is a good choice when the JSN being read or written maps
 closely to a .NET class.
 .
 LINQ to JSON is good for situations in which there is no class to serialize or
 deserialize to, or the JSON is radically different from the class structure and
 manual manipulation is required.
 .
 This package contains a NuGet package, for build systems which rely on NuGet
