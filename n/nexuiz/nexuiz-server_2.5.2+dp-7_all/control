Description: Standalone server for Nexuiz Classic
 Nexuiz Classic is a fast-paced 3D deathmatch game with high-end and complex
 graphics effects. It is intended to be played over the Internet or over a
 local network, though it also supports a single-player mode.
 .
 The game brings deathmatch back to the basics, with perfect weapon  balancing
 and fast paced action, keeping itself away from the current trend of realistic
 shooters.
 .
 This package installs the standalone server.
 .
 This game was originally released as "Nexuiz", but is now referred to as
 "Nexuiz Classic" since the Nexuiz name was re-used for a non-free game
 for consoles.
