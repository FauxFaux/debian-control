Description: netflow capture daemon
 Collects and processes netflow data with command line tools. Collected netflow
 data is stored in filesystem and is limited by available storage space only.
 Tools are optimized for speed and filtering. nfcapd reads netflow v5, v7, v9
 and IPFIX flows transparently. You need one nfcapd process for each netflow
 stream.
