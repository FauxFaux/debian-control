Description: Spice circuit simulator - development files for ngspice and tclspice
 NGSpice is a mixed-level/mixed-signal circuit simulator. Its code is based on
 three open source software packages:
 Spice3f5, Cider1b1 and Xspice.
 .
 Use this package in case you need to compile own Xspice models as a dynamic
 library with a file extension *.cm. Those files need to be placed into
 /usr/lib/$(multiarch)/ngspice and will be loaded by the ngspice executable.
 .
 This package contains the development header files for libspice and own
 ngspice dynamic library models.
