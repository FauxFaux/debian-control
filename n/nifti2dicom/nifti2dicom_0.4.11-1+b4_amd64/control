Description: convert 3D medical images to DICOM 2D series
 Nifti2Dicom is a convertion tool that converts 3D NIfTI files (and other
 formats supported by ITK, including Analyze, MetaImage Nrrd and VTK)
 to DICOM.
 Unlike other conversion tools, it can import a DICOM file that is used
 to import the patient and study DICOM tags, and allows you to edit the
 accession number and other DICOM tags, in order to create a valid DICOM
 that can be imported in a PACS.
 .
 This package includes the command line tools.
