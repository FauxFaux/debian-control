Description: Mapnik to image export
 Nik4 is a mapnik-to-image exporting script using the Mapnik Python
 bindings.
 .
 Nik4 takes great care to preserve values you feed it. If you say you
 need a 800x600 image, it won't take a pixel less or more. It won't
 shrink a bounding box or distort lines when specifying so called "scale
 factor". When you need a 300 dpi image, you tell it --ppi 300 and can be
 sure you will get what you intended.
 .
 Also it can use real-world units, that is, millimeters (and prefers to).
 Specify dimensions for printing, choose bounding box and ppi scale - and
 the result won't disappoint. Options are intuitive and plenty, and you
 will be amazed how much tasks became simpler with Nik4.
