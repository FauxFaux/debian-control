Description: platform game where your goal is to collect candies
 You play the role of a 9 year old boy in his absolute dream: a world made
 of sweets! Guide Nikwi through his dream to eat everything in each of the 30
 levels, while you avoid the monsters who try to turn Nikwi's dream into a
 nightmare.
 .
 Nikwi features hours of gameplay in 30 sweet-themed levels made of five
 candy themes, more than 10 different monsters and obstacles -each one with
 it's own unique behaviour- and new gameplay elements in every theme.
