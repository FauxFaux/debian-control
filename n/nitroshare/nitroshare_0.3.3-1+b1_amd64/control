Description: Cross-platform network file transfer application
 NitroShare is designed to make transferring any file to any device as painless
 as possible.
 .
 NitroShare uses a JSON-based protocol that is both platform and
 architecture-neutral to transfer files as efficiently as possible. For added
 security, transfers can be encrypted with TLS.
 .
 IPv4 broadcast is used for automatically discovering other devices on the local
 network running NitroShare. This enables files and entire directories to be
 instantly transferred to the other devices.
 .
 An HTTP API is provided that enables other applications running under the same
 account to initiate transfers.
