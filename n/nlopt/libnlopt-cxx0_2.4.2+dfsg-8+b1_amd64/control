Description: nonlinear optimization library (C++ interface)
 NLopt is a free/open-source library for nonlinear optimization, providing
 a common interface for a number of different free optimization routines
 available online as well as original implementations of various other
 algorithms. Its features include:
 .
    * Callable from C, C++, Fortran, GNU Octave, Python, GNU Guile, GNU R.
    * A common interface for many different algorithms
    * Support for large-scale optimization.
    * Both global and local optimization algorithms.
    * Algorithms using function values only (derivative-free) and also
      algorithms exploiting user-supplied gradients.
    * Algorithms for unconstrained optimization, bound-constrained optimization,
      and general nonlinear inequality/equality constraints.
 .
 This package provides the shared libraries required to run programs
 compiled with NLopt in C++. To compile your own programs you also need to
 install libnlopt-cxx-dev.
