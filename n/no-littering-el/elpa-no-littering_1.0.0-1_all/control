Description: help keeping ~/.emacs.d clean
 The default paths used to store configuration files and persistent
 data are not consistent across Emacs packages. This isn't just a
 problem with third-party packages but even with built-in packages.
 .
 This package sets out to fix this by changing the values of path
 variables to put files in either `no-littering-etc-directory'
 (defaulting to "~/.emacs.d/etc/") or `no-littering-var-directory'
 (defaulting to "~/.emacs.d/var/"), and by using descriptive file
 names and subdirectories when appropriate.
