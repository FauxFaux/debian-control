Description: Advanced ANSI formatting tool for Node.js
 node-ansi is a module for Node.js that provides an easy-to-use API
 for writing ANSI escape codes to Stream instances.
 ANSI escape codes are used to do fancy things in a terminal window,
 like render text in colors, delete characters, lines, the entire window,
 or hide and show the cursor, and lots more.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side javascript engine.
