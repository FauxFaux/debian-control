Description: Resolve any installed ES6 compatible promise
 Let your library support any ES 2015 (ES6) compatible `Promise` and leave the
 choice to application authors. The application can *optionally* register its
 preferred `Promise` implementation and it will be exported when requiring
 `any-promise` from library code.
