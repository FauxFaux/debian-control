Description: small wrapper over nodejs' assert module with two extra features
 This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
 things:
 (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
 NODE_NDEBUG, and
 (2) some API wrappers for argument testing. Like assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
