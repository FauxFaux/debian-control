Description: Buffer collections as contiguous partially mutable Buffer
 The buffers module allows you to treat a collection of Buffers as a single
 contiguous partially mutable Buffer.
 .
 Where possible, operations execute without creating a new Buffer and copying
 everything over.
 .
 buffers is a cleaner more Buffery rehash of bufferlist.
 .
 This package contains the buffers module for Node.js
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
