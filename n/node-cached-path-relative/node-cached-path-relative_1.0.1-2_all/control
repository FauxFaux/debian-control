Description: Memoize the results of the path.relative function
 path.relative function can be an expensive operation
 if it happens a lot, and its results have a low probability to
 change for the same arguments.
 .
 This module thus cache (memoize) the result of path.relative,
 in order to speed of browserify.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
