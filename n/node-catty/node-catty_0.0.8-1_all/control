Description: source file concatenator for Mapshaper
 Catty is the source file concatenator for Mapshaper.
 .
 Some features:
  * Each source file lists its dependencies in a formatted comment. There is
  no manifest, unlike some other tools.
  * Concatenated files are (optionally) wrapped in a self-executing function,
  to protect the global namespace.
  * Catty can monitor source files and regenerate output files when a required
  source file changes.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
