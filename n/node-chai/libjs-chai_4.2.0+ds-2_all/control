 on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements
 are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved
 to pass the new tests
 .
 BDD of Behavior-Driven Development is an extension of test-driven
 development that makes use of a simple, domain-specific scripting
 language (DSL). These DSLs convert structured natural language statements
 into executable tests.
