Description: evented streaming JSON parser - Node.js module
 clarinet is a Node.js module which provides a streaming parser for JSON.
 clarinet is inspired (and forked) from sax-js.
 .
 clarenet is intended to create better full text support in Node.js. Creating
 indexes out of large (or many) JSON files does not require a full
 understanding of the JSON file, but it does require something like clarinet.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
