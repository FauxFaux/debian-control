Description: Tool for minifying CSS files
 Clean-css is a Node.js module for minifying CSS files. It does the same job as
 YUI Compressor's CSS minifier, but much faster thanks to many speed
 optimizations and Node.js' V8 engine.
 .
 The cleancss tool is a reference implementation for the Clean-css Node.js
 module.
