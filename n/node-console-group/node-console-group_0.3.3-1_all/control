Description: basic console.group implementation for node
 In browsers, console.group() is an incredibly useful debugging tool. This
 module implements the same in Node.js.

 It's a 5 minute job - highly unsophisticated, doesn't even have a test suite,
 so YMMV.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
