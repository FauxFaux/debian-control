Description: cookie parsing middleware with signatures - Node.js module
 This module provides an express/connect middleware for parsing
 the HTTP Cookie header. It populates req.cookies with an object
 keyed by the cookie names.
 .
 Cookies can be optionally signed with a secret string, which is then
 stored in the 'secret' property of the Request object, so it can be
 used by other middleware.
 .
 Express is a web application framework for Node.js.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
