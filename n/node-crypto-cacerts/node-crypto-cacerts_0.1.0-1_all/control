Description: updates SSL certificate chain to use a directory of certificates
 Node has a set of trusted certificates compiled into it that is uses
 during SSL/HTTPS negotiations. The list of certificates can be replaced
 with user-specified certificates during the usage of the https module,
 but only for that particular https instance.
 .
 Sometimes, one need to use libraries that make the HTTPS calls deep within,
 and cannot modify the code. This module is designed to monkey patch the
 built-in crypto module and allow you to specify a directory of existing
 certificates that apply to all HTTPS connections that are made using the
 underlying crypto module.
 .
 Usage:
 .
  require('./crypto-cacerts').cryptoPatch("/etc/ssl/certs");
 .
 This will use all of the certificates in your OpenSSL certificates directory.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
