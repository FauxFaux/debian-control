Description: Safe parsing of CSON files
 Node-cson-parser is a minimalistic CSON parser which offers:
  - A strict subset of CSON that allows only data
  - Interface is identical to JSON.{parse,stringify}
  - Does not run the code, free of intermediate string representations
  - Sane parse error messages with line/column
  - Regular Expressions are considered data and will be accepted as well
 .
 In addition of pure data it allows for simple arithmetic expressions like
 addition and multiplication. This allows more readable configuration
 of numbers.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
