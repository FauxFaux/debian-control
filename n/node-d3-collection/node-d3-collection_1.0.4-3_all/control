Description: Handy data structures for elements keyed by string
 A common data type in JavaScript is the *associative array*, or more simply
 the *object*, which has a set of named properties. The standard mechanism for
 iterating over the keys (or property names) in an associative array is the
 forâ€¦in loop. However, note that the iteration order is undefined.
 .
 D3 provides several methods for converting associative arrays to standard
 arrays with numeric indexes.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
