Description: Serialize Canvas path commands to SVG
 Say you have some code that draws to a 2D canvas, the d3-path module lets you
 take this exact code and additionally render to SVG. It works by serializing
 CanvasPathMethods calls to SVG path data.
 .
 Now code you write once can be used with both Canvas (for performance) and SVG
 (for convenience). For a practical example, see d3-shape.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
