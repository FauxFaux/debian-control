Description: efficient queue to manage thousands of concurrent animations

 concurrent animations, while guaranteeing consistent, synchronized timing with
 concurrent or staged animations. Internally, it uses requestAnimationFrame for
 fluid animation (if available), switching to setTimeout for delays longer than
 24ms.
