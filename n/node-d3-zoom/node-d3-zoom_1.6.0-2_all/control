Description: Pan and zoom SVG, HTML or Canvas using mouse or touch input
 Panning and zooming are popular interaction techniques which let the user
 focus on a region of interest by restricting the view.
 .
 The zoom behavior implemented by d3-zoom is a convenient but flexible
 abstraction for enabling pan-and-zoom on selections. It handles a surprising
 variety of input events and browser quirks. The zoom behavior is agnostic
 about the DOM, so you can use it with SVG, HTML or Canvas.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
