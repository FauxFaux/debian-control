Description: small debugging utility for Node.js
 node-debug provides a small debugging utility for Node.js modules.
 .
 With this module you simply invoke the exported function to generate
 your debug function, passing it a name which will determine if a
 noop function is returned, or a decorated console.error, so all of the
 console format string goodies you're used to work fine.
 A unique color is selected per-function for visibility.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
