Description: Improved deep equality testing for Node.js and the browser
 Deep Eql is a module which you can use to determine if two
 objects are "deeply" equal - that is, rather than having
 referential equality (a === b), this module checks an
 object's keys recursively, until it finds primitives to
 check for referential equality. For more on equality in JavaScript,
 read the comparison operators article on mdn.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
