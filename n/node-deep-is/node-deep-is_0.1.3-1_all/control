Description: node's assert.deepEqual algorithm except for NaN being equal to NaN
 Node's `assert.deepEqual() algorithm` as a standalone module. Exactly like
 deep-equal except for the fact that `deepEqual(NaN, NaN) === true`.
 .
 This module is around 5 times faster than wrapping `assert.deepEqual()` in a
 `try/catch`.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
