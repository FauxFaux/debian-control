Description: return the first argument that is `!== undefined`
 Most of the time when you chain together ||s, you actually just want the
 first item that is not undefined, not the first non-falsy item.
 .
 This module is like the defined-or (//) operator in perl 5.10+.

 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
