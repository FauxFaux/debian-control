Description: pure javascript diffie-hellman key exchange
 Diffie–Hellman key exchange (DH) is a specific method of securely
 exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel. The
 Diffie–Hellman key exchange method allows two parties that have no
 prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key
 over an insecure channel. This key can then be used to encrypt
 subsequent communications using a symmetric key cipher.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
