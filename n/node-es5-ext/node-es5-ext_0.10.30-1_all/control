Description: ECMAScript extensions and shims
 Shims for upcoming ES6 standard and other goodies implemented strictly with
 ECMAScript conventions in mind.
 .
 It's designed to be used in compliant ECMAScript 5 or ECMAScript 6
 environments. Older environments are not supported, although most of the
 features should work with correct ECMAScript 5 shim on board.
 .
 When used in ECMAScript 6 environment, native implementation (if valid) takes
 precedence over shims.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
