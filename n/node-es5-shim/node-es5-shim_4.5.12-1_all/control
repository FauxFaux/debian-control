Description: ECMAScript 5 compatibility shims for old JavaScript engines (Node.js)
 The es5-shim library monkey-patches a JavaScript context to contain
 all ECMAScript 5 methods that can be faithfully emulated with a
 legacy JavaScript engine.
 .
 The es5-sham part tries to complete the picture as best as possible, but
 for those methods the result is not as close and mostly intends to avoid
 runtime errors : in many cases it might just silently fail.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
