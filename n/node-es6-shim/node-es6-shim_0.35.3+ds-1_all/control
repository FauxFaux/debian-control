Description: ECMAScript 6 compat. shims for legacy JavaScript engines (Node.js)
 The es6-shim library monkey-patches a JavaScript context to contain all
 ECMAScript 6 (Harmony) methods that can be faithfully emulated with a legacy
 JavaScript engine.
 .
 The es6-sham part tries to complete the picture as best as possible, but
 for those methods the result is not as close and mostly intends to avoid
 runtime errors : in many cases it might just silently fail.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
