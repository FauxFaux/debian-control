Description: Esprima-compatible JavaScript parser built on Acorn
 Espree started out as a fork of Esprima v1.2.2, the last stable published
 released of Esprima before work on ECMAScript 6 began. Espree is now built on
 top of Acorn, which has a modular architecture that allows extension of core
 functionality. The goal of Espree is to produce output that is similar to
 Esprima with a similar API so that it can be used in place of Esprima.
