Description: secure key derivation algorithm in pure javascript
 This package derives a key and IV using well known
 cipher and message digest algorithm, thus creating secure IV and
 keys from salt. This package is a clean room implementation
 of openssl algorithm.
 .
 In cryptography, an initialization vector (IV) or starting variable
 is a fixed-size input to a cryptographic primitive that is typically
 required to be random or pseudorandom.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
