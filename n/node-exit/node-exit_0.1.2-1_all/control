Description: replacement for process.exit that ensures stdio is fully drained
 To make a long story short, if process.exit is called on Windows, script
 output is often truncated when pipe-redirecting stdout or stderr. This
 module attempts to work around this issue by waiting until those streams
 have been completely drained before actually calling process.exit.
