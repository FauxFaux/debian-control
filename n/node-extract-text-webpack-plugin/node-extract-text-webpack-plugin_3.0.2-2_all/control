Description: Extract text from bundle into a file
 It moves all the required *.css modules in entry chunks into a separate CSS
 file. So styles are no longer inlined into the JS bundle, but in a separate
 CSS file (styles.css). If total stylesheet volume is big, it will be faster
 because the CSS bundle is loaded in parallel to the JS bundle.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
