Description: Node.js module to read and write FastCGI records
 node-fastcgi-stream provides two main pieces, the FastCGIStream itself and
 the records that can be sent and received on it.
 .
 The FastCGIStream wraps an existing Stream to send/receive FCGI records on.
 99% of the time this is going to be a net.Socket.
