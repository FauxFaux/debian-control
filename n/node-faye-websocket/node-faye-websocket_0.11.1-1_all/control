Description: standards-compliant WebSocket library for Node.js
 This is a general-purpose WebSocket implementation extracted from the Faye
 project. It provides classes for easily building WebSocket servers and
 clients in Node. It does not provide a server itself, but rather makes it
 easy to handle WebSocket connections within an existing Node application. It
 does not provide any abstraction other than the standard WebSocket API.
 .
 It also provides an abstraction for handling EventSource connections, which
 are one-way connections that allow the server to push data to the client.
 They are based on streaming HTTP responses and can be easier to access via
 proxies than WebSockets.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
