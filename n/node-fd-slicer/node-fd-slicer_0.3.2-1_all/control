Description: create multiple ReadStreams or WriteStreams from the same fd - Node.js module
 This module provides an API for creating multiple ReadStreams or WriteStreams
 from the same file descriptor.
 .
 The official Node.js API docs say that it is unsafe to use fs.write multiple
 times on the same file without waiting for the callback. This module solves
 this problem.
 .
 fd-slicer also provides additional features that builtin fs.createWriteStream
 is lacking, such as progress events and setting a maximum size to write.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
