Description: tool for respawning node binaries when special flags are present
 This Node.js module can be useful for command-line scripts
 written in JavaScript. It can selectively apply flags to
 the interpreter, by re-spawning it and passing it only Â 
 the required flags - the rest are passed to the script.
 .
 Flagged-respawn also handles all the edge cases such as:
  - Providing a method to determine if a respawn is needed.
  - Piping stderr/stdout from the child into the parent.
  - Making the parent process exit with the same code as the child.
  - If the child is killed, making the parent exit with the same signal.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
