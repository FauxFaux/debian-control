Description: fs-extra contains methods not included in the Node.js fs module
 The fs-extra Node.js module adds a few extra file system methods that aren't
 included in the native fs module. It is a drop in replacement for fs.
 .
 The module implements common filesystem operations such as copy(), move(),
 mkdirs(), remove(), and specific read/write operations like
 readFile() & outputFile() and readJson() & outputJson().
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
