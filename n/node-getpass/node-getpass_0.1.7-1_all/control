Description: get a password from terminal
 This library can be used to get a password from the terminal. Even though it
 sounds simple and sounds like the `readline` module should be able to do it.
 But readline module does not support it.
 .
 If available, this uses `/dev/tty` to avoid interfering with any data being
 piped in or out of stdio. This function prints a prompt (by default
 `Password:`) and then accepts input without echoing.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
