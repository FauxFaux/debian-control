Description: wrapper around node-glob to make it streamy
 You can pass any combination of globs. One caveat is that you can not only
 pass a glob negation, you must give it at least one positive glob so it knows
 where to start. All given must match for the file to be returned.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
