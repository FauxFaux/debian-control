Description: drop-in replacement improving the Node.js fs module
 node-graceful-fs module normalizes behavior across different platforms
 and environments, and makes filesystem access more resilient to errors:
  * queues up open and readdir calls, and retries them once something
    closes if there is an EMFILE error from too many file descriptors.
  * fixes lchmod for Node versions prior to 0.6.2
  * implements fs.lutimes if possible. Otherwise it becomes a noop.
  * ignores EINVAL and EPERM errors in chown, fchown or lchown if the
    user isn't root.
  * makes lchmod and lchown become noops, if not available.
  * retries reading a file if read results in EAGAIN error.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side javascript engine.
