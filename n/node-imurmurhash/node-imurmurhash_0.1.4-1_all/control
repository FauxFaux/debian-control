Description: incremental implementation of MurmurHash3 hashing algorithm
 This module is an incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit)
 hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on Gary Court's implementation with
 kazuyukitanimura's modifications.
 .
 This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if
 you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string
 concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version)
 is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about
 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
