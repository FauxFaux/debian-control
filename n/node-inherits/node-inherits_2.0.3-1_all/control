Description: Exposes inherits function from Node.js environment
 node-inherits exposes standard inherits implementation of Node.js util
 module, and allows bundlers such as browserify to not include full util
 package in client code.
 .
 It is recommended to use this module for all code that requires only
 the inherits function and that has a chance to run in a browser too.
 .
 This is the Node.js module.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side javascript engine.
