Description: Gettext Style i18n for Modern JavaScript Apps - JavaScript library
 If you don't specifically need a gettext implementation, look at MessageFormat
 instead, as it has better support for plurals/gender and has built-in locale
 data.
 .
 Jed doesn't include a Gettext file parser, but several third-party parsers
 exist that can have their output adapted for Jed.
 .
 This package contains jed suitable for use with browser environments.
