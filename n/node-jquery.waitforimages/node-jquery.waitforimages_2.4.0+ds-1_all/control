Description: useful callbacks once descendant images have loaded
 waitForImages also supports both images referenced in CSS, such as the
 'background-image' property, and images referenced in element attributes such
 as srcset. Images referenced in attributes can also be a comma-separated list
 of images.
 .
 It can be useful when WebKit incorrectly reports element dimensions/offsets on
 document ready, because it has not calculated their descendant 'img'
 dimensions yet.
 .
 Supports all browsers you probably care about.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
