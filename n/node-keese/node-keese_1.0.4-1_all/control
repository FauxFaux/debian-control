Description: arbitrary-precision floats encoded as strings - Node.js module
 keese is a Node.js module that generates well-ordered values, appropriate for
 use as sorting keys.
 .
 keese can always generate a bigger value, a smaller value, and a value
 between two other values. This is trivial using numbers with x+1, x-1, and
 (x+y)/2 respectively. However, numbers have limited precision in JavaScript,
 so instead keese uses strings.
 .
 The string values are comparable with the builtin comparison operators (such
 as <), and keese can always generate a new value that satisfies the
 constraints (limited only by system resources).
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
