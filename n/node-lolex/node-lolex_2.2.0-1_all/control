Description: Fake JavaScript timers
 JavaScript implementation of the timer APIs; setTimeout, clearTimeout,
 setImmediate, clearImmediate, setInterval and clearInterval, along with a
 clock instance that controls the flow of time. Lolex also provides a Date
 implementation that gets its time from the clock.
 .
 Lolex can be used to simulate passing time in automated tests and other
 situations where you want the scheduling semantics, but don't want to
 actually wait. Lolex is extracted from Sinon.JS.
