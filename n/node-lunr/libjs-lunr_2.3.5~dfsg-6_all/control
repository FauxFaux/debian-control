Description: simple full-text search - web browsers
 Lunr.js is a small, full-text search library for use in the browser.
 It indexes JSON documents and provides a simple search interface
 for retrieving documents that best match text queries.
 Async is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful
 functions for working with asynchronous Javascript.
 .
 This package provides Lunr for use directly in web browsers.
 .
 Browsers that do not support ES5 will require a JavaScript shim
 for Lunr to work.
 You can either use Augment.js, ES5-Shim,
 or any library that patches old browsers
 to provide an ES5 compatible JavaScript environment.
