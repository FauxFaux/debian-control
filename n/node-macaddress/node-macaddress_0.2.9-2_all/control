Description: Get MAC addresses of host network interfaces in Node.js
 node-macaddress is a nodejs library that retrieves the MAC addresses
 (hardware addresses) of the host's network interfaces.
 It provides a convenient wrapper of os.networkInterfaces() call.
 .
 If the host system has more than one network interface, it will
 automatically pick one appropriate interface if you'are only interested
 in one MAC address identifying the host system.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
