Description: implementation of MD5 in pure JavaScript
 This module implement md5 on pure javascript for browserify.
 .
 The MD5 algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit
 hash value. Although  MD5 was initially designed to be used as a
 cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from
 extensive vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a checksum to
 verify data integrity,  but only against unintentional corruption.
