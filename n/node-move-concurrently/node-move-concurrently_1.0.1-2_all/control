Description: Move files and directories concurrently
 Promises of moves of files or directories with rename, falling back to
 recursive rename/copy on EXDEV errors, with configurable concurrency and win32
 junction support.
 .
 If you `move` across devices or on filesystems that don't support renaming
 large directories.  That is, situations that result in `rename` returning
 the `EXDEV` error, then `move` will fallback to copy + delete.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
