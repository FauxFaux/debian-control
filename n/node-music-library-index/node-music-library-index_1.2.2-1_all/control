Description: build a searchable object model given track metadata objects - Node.js module
 Given track metadata objects, constructs a searchable object model.
 .
 Sort order ignores 'a', 'an' and 'the' in artists, albums, and names. Sorting
 and searching is case insensitive and diacritics-insensitive. Searching uses
 word-based filtering on all track fields. Distinguishes albums by name, date,
 and album artist.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
