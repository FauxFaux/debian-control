Description: Native Abstractions for Node.js
 A header file filled with macro and utility goodness for making addon
 development for Node.js easier across versions 0.8, 0.10 and 0.11, and
 eventually 0.12.
 .
 Thanks to the crazy changes in V8 (and some in Node core), keeping
 native addons compiling happily across versions, particularly 0.10 to
 0.11/0.12, is a minor nightmare. The goal of this project is to store
 all logic necessary to develop native Node.js addons without having to
 inspec NODE_MODULE_VERSION and get yourself into a macro-tangle.
 .
 This project also contains some helper utilities that make addon
 development a bit more pleasant.
