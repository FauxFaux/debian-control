Description: light-weight option parsing library for NodeJS
 Optimist is a light-weight node.js library for option parsing.
 .
 It is a library for people who hate option parsing. More specifically,
 this module is for people who like all the --bells and -whistlz of
 program usage but think optstrings are a waste of time.
 .
 With optimist, option parsing doesn't have to suck (as much).
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
