Description: very small implementation of the Promises/A+ specification
 This Node.js package is a minimalist Promises/A+ implementation for embedding.
 You can use it as a lightweight dependency for your library if you need to
 return a promise. It is not intended as a stand-alone library for more complex
 applications, and therefore does not support assimilation of other promises.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
