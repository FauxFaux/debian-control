Description: Discard comments in your CSS files with PostCSS
 This module discards comments from your CSS files; by default, it will remove
 all regular comments (/* comment */) and preserve comments marked as important
 (/*! important */).
 .
 Note that this module does not handle source map comments because they are not
 available to it; PostCSS handles this internally, so if they are removed then
 you will have to configure source maps in PostCSS.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
