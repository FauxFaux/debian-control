Description: remote address filter for proxied requests - Node.js module
 This module allows one to list and optionally filter remote addresses
 of an incoming request, as populated by the HTTP X-Forwarded-For header.
 .
 It works with both IPv4 and IPv6 and can filter addresses using pre-defined
 names like "loopback", "linklocal" or "uniquelocal" (which are expanded
 internally into IP addresses or ranges), or using a custom function.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
