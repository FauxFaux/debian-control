Description: JavaScript library for promises (CommonJS/Promises/A,B,D)
 Q is a tool for creating and composing asynchronous promises in JavaScript.
 .
 If a function cannot return a value or throw an exception without blocking,
 it can return a promise instead. A promise is an object that represents the
 return value or the thrown exception that the function may eventually provide.
 A promise can also be used as a proxy for a remote object to overcome latency.
 .
 This package contains the q.js JavaScript library.
