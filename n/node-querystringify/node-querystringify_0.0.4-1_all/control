Description: Querystringify - Small, simple but powerful query string parser
 A somewhat JSON compatible interface for query string parsing. This query
 string parser is dumb, don't expect to much from it as it only wants to
 parse simple query strings.
 .
 This module is also compatible with browserify so it can be used on the
 server as well as on the client.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
