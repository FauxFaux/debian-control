Description: Request-Answer-Interface for generating text based command servers (SMTP,POP)
 rai is a node.js module to easily generate text based command line servers.
 When a client sends something to the server, the first word of the line is
 treated as a command and the rest of the line as binary payload.
 .
 In addition to line based commands, there's also a data mode, to transmit
 everygting received. And there's also an option to switch to TLS mode for
 secure connections.
 .
 This way it is trivial to create SMTP, POP3 or similar servers.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
