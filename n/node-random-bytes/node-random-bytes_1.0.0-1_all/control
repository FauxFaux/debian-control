Description: generate strong pseudo-random bytes
 This module is a simple wrapper around the Node.js core crypto.randomBytes
 API, with the following additions:
 .
   * A Promise interface for environments with promises.
   * For Node.js versions that do not wait for the PRNG to be seeded,
     this module will wait a bit.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
