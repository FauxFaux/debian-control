Description: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
 Some features of React:
  * Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design
 simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently
 update and render just the right components when your data changes.
 Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and
 easier to debug.
  * Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state,
 then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in
 JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your
 app and keep state out of the DOM.
  * Learn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of
 your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without
 rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and
 power mobile apps using React Native.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
