Description: Node.js read-only stream implementation
 This module allow one to use a readable/writable stream internally but to
 expose just the readable part of that internal stream.
 .
 A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js.
 There are many stream objects provided by Node.js. For instance, a request to
 an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
