Description: Seamless integration between Rollup and Babel
 If you're using Babel to transpile your ES6/7 code and Rollup to generate a
 standalone bundle, you have a couple of options:
  * run the code through Babel first, being careful to exclude the module
    transformer, or
  * run the code through Rollup first, and *then* pass it to Babel.
 .
 Both approaches have disadvantages. Using Rollup with rollup-plugin-babel
 makes the process far easier.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
