Description: Next-generation ES6 module bundler
 Rollup is a smaller, more efficient alternative to webpack and Browserify to
 bundle JavaScript files. Compared to the other tools for creating JavaScript
 bundles, Rollup will almost always create a smaller, faster bundle.
 .
 This happens because Rollup is based on ES2015 modules, which are more
 efficient than CommonJS modules, which are what webpack and Browserify use.
 Itâ€™s also much easier for Rollup to remove unused code from modules using
 something called tree-shaking, which basically just means only the code we
 actually need is included in the final bundle.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
