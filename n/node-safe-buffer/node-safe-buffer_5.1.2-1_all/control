Description: Safer Node.js Buffer API
 The goal of this package is to provide a safe replacement for the node.js
 `Buffer`. It's a drop-in replacement for `Buffer`. You can use it by adding
 one `require` line to the top of your node.js modules; for example
 var Buffer = require('safe-buffer').Buffer
 Existing buffer code will continue to work without issues.
 This package is a dependency for ava.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
