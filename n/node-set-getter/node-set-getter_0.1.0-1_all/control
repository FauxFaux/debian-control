Description: Create nested getter properties and any intermediary dot notation
 Create nested getter properties and any intermediary dot notation (`'a.b.c'`)
 paths.
 .
 set-getter works like set-value by adding a property to an object or an
 object hierarchy using dot notation. The main difference is that the property
 is added using Object.defineProperty and is expected to be a getter function
 that returns a value.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
