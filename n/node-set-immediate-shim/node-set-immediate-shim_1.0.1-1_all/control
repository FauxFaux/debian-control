Description: Simple setImmediate shim
 setImmediate allows scripts to yield to the browser, executing a  given
 operation asynchronously, in a manner that is typically  more efficient and
 consumes less power than the usual  setTimeout(..., 0) pattern. This library
 provides a simple setImmediate shim.
 .
 This library is a dependency of readdirp. Even though we have setimmediate
 packaged, patching readdirp to use it is more work.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
