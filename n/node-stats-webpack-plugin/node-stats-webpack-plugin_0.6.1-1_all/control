Description: Write the stats of a build to a file
 Webpack takes code targeted at node.js and makes it run in the browser.
 Node.js comes with API of its own that is not available in the browsers.
 Webpack exposes this code to programs that are unaware they are running in a
 browser.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
