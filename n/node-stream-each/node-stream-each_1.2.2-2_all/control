Description: Iterate all the data in a stream
 Iterate the data in the stream by calling the iterator function with
 (data, next) where data is a data chunk and next is a callback. Call next when
 you are ready to consume the next chunk. Optionally you can call next with an
 error to destroy the stream. When the stream ends/errors the callback is
 called if provided.
