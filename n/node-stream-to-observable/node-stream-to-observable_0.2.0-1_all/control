Description: Convert Node Streams into ECMAScript-Observables
 Observables have much in common with Streams, in that they both represent data
 that arrives over time. Most Observable implementations provide expressive
 methods for filtering and mutating incoming data. Methods like `.map()`,
 `.filter()`, and `.forEach` behave very similarly to their Array counterparts,
 so using Observables can be very intuitive.

 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
