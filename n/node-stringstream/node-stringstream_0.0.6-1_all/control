Description: Encode and decode streams into string streams
 No need to deal with `setEncoding()` weirdness, just compose streams
 like they were supposed to be!
 .
 Also deals with `base64` output correctly by aligning each emitted data
 chunk so that there are no dangling `=` characters.
 .
 This library is a dependency of request, the simplest way possible to make
 http calls.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
