Description: Make a stream.Transform out of a function - Node.js module
 This package provide a tiny wrapper around stream.Transform from
 Node.js library to avoid explicit subclassing noise.
 .
 Inspired by Dominic Tarr's through module in that it's so much easier
 to make a stream out of a function than it is to set up the prototype
 chain properly.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
