Description: timers module for browserify
 This library adds support for the `timers` module to browserify. Browsers
 support the public methods of the `timers` module already.
 .
 But the `timers` module also includes some private methods used in other
 built-in Node.js modules. These are used to efficiently support a large
 quantity of timers with the same timeouts by creating only a few timers under
 the covers.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
