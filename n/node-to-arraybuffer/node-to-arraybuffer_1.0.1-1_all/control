Description: Get an ArrayBuffer from a Buffer as fast as possible
 Note that in some cases the returned ArrayBuffer is backed by the same memory
 as the original Buffer (but in other cases it is a copy), so **modifying the
 ArrayBuffer is not recommended**.
 .
 This module is designed to work both in node.js and in all browsers with
 ArrayBuffer support when using the Buffer implementation provided by
 Browserify
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
