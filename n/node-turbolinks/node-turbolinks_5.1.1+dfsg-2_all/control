Description: Turbolinks makes navigating your web application faster
 Get the performance benefits of a single-page application without the added
 complexity of a client-side JavaScript framework. Use HTML to render your
 views on the server side and link to pages as usual. When you follow a link,
 Turbolinks automatically fetches the page, swaps in its <body>, and merges
 its <head>, all without incurring the cost of a full page load.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
