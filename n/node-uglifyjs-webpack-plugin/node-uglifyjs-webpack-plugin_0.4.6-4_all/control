Description: UglifyJS plugin for webpack
 This plugin uses UglifyJS v2 to minify your JavaScript.
 .
 Note that webpack contains the same plugin under
 webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin. This is a standalone version for those that
 want to control the version of UglifyJS. The documentation is valid apart from
 the installation instructions in that case.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
