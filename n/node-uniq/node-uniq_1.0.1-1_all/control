Description: Removes duplicates from a sorted array in place
 Why use this instead of underscore.uniq[ue]?
 A few reasons:
  * This library updates the array in place without making an extra copy (and
 so it is faster for large arrays)
  * It also accepts a custom comparison function so you can remove duplicates
 from arrays containing object
  * It is more modular in the sense that it doesn't come with a bazillion other
 utility grab bag functions.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
