Description: Parse URL in node using the URL module and in the browser using the DOM
 The url-parse method exposes two different API interfaces. The url interface
 that you know from Node.js and the new URL interface that is available in
 the latest browsers.
 .
 Since 0.1 we've moved away from using the DOM's <a> element for URL parsing
 and moving to a full Regular Expression solution. The main reason for this
 change is to make the URL parser available in different JavaScript
 environments as you don't always have access to the DOM like Worker
 environments.  This module still have a really small foot print as this
 module's main intention is to be bundled with client-side code. The only
 problem however with a RegExp based solution is that it required a lot of
 lookups causing major problems in FireFox. So the last and the current
 solution was a pure string parsing solution which chops up the URL in
 smaller pieces.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
