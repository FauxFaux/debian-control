Description: Virtual file format
 Vinyl is a very simple metadata object that describes a file. When you think
 of a file, two attributes come to mind: `path` and `contents`. These are the
 main attributes on a Vinyl object. A file does not necessarily represent
 something on your computerâ€™s file system. You have files on S3, FTP, Dropbox,
 Box, CloudThingly.io and other services. Vinyl can be used to describe files
 from all of these sources.
