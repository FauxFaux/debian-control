Description: WebSocket protocol handler with pluggable I/O for Node.js
 This module provides a complete implementation of the WebSocket protocols
 that can be hooked up to any I/O stream. It aims to simplify things by
 decoupling the protocol details from the I/O layer, such that users only
 need to implement code to stream data in and out of it without needing to
 know anything about how the protocol actually works.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
