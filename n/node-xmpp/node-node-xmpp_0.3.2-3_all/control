Description: idiomatic XMPP library for Node
 Node is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
 .
 Idiomatic XMPP client, component & server library for Node.
 .
 Objectives of node-xmpp:
  * Use Node conventions, especially 'EventEmitter', ie. for write
    buffer control
  * Fast parsing, 'node-expat' was written with this library in mind
  * Client support for both XMPP clients and components
  * Optional server infrastructure with 'Router'
  * After authentication, leave trivial protocol bits to the user, that
    is XML handling according to any XEP
 .
 Features
  * Client authentication with SASL DIGEST-MD5, PLAIN, ANONYMOUS,
    X-FACEBOOK-PLATFORM
  * `_xmpp-client._tcp` SRV record support
  * Simple JID parsing with Stringprep normalization (optional: requires
    node-stringprep installed)
  * Uses ltx
    * Much easier to handle than a standard DOM
    * xmlns-aware
    * Easy XML builder like Strophe.js (see down)
    * Non-buffering serialization
    * Was split out of node-xmpp for modularization and resuability
  * Component connections
  * Run your own server/talk to other servers with `xmpp.Router`
