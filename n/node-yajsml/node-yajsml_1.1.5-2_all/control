Description: Yet another (Common)JS module loader
 Yajsml is a server-side component that allows JavaScript code to be
 distributed in a reliable and performant way. Its three features are:
 .
   - Proxy pass through for individual resource requests.
   - Bulk responses for requests of closely associated resources
     (e.g. dependencies) when a request specifies a JSONP-style callback.
   - Canonical packaged resources where requests for disparate resources
     may be fulfilled through a redirect to one canonical packaged resource
     (which exploits warmed caches).
 .
 The toolâ€™s interface is simple enough that there is no need for a prescribed
 implementation on the client-side. That said, the require-kernel is a terse
 implementation of a CommonJS module manager that can use all the features in
 yajsml.
