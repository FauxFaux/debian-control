Description: yet another web sockets library
 yawl is a Node.js module which provides an API to create a web socket server
 and a web socket client. It is RFC 6455 compliant with two exceptions:
 .
 First, it uses Node.js's built in UTF-8 decoding instead of strictly closing
 the connection when decoding errors occur.
 .
 Second, the "payload length" field is limited to 2 to the power of 52 instead
 of 2 to the power of 64.
 .
 yawl uses streams and handles backpressure correctly. It is a pure JavaScript
 implementation.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
