Description: evented I/O for V8 javascript (debhelper files)
 Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily
 building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an
 event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and
 efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run
 across distributed devices.
 .
 This package provides the nodejs debhelper tool, which is no longer
 needed. Plugins should instead declare a build dependency on libnode-dev.
