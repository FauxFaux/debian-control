Description: create colorful video barcodes -- development files
 nordlicht converts video files into colorful barcodes. It's heavily inspired
 by the "moviebarcode" tumblr. It takes the video's frames in regular
 intervals, scales them to 1px width, and appends them. The resulting barcodes
 can be integrated into video players for simplified navigation.
 .
 This package contains the development files which are needed if you want to
 include nordlicht functionality into your own applications.
