Description: adjusts the volume of WAV, MP3 and OGG files to a standard volume level
 normalize-audio is a tool for adjusting the volume of WAV, MP3 and OGG files
 to a standard volume level. This is useful for things like creating mix CDs
 and MP3 databases, where different recording levels on different albums
 can cause the volume to vary greatly from song to song.
