Description: Next generation of nicer testing for Python3
 Nose2 is testing library aimed at being compatible with unittest and
 providing additional features, such as timed tests, better testing for
 exceptions. It also provides fixture methods at the package, module, class or
 test case level, depending on the developer's needs.
 .
 At an extended level, nose2 also provides a lot of builtin plugins to help
 with specific needs, including tests coverage, profiling, or doctests.
 .
 Nose2 is based on the Nose testsuite, which is no longer developed. It
 provides a better plugin API and supports Python2 and Python3 from the same
 codebase.
 .
 This package provides the python3 version of nose2.
