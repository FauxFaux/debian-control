Description: control the size of text of websites
 NoSquint allows you to adjust the text-only and full-page
 (both text and images) zoom levels as well as color settings
 both globally (for all sites) and per site.
 Having a hard time reading on the web? Is that website with the ridiculously
 small font and hot-pink-on-slightly-darker-hot-pink text raising your blood
 pressure? NoSquint can:
 .
 Override the default text-only and full-page (both text and images) zoom
 levels for all websites
 .
 Enforce your own foreground and background colors
 .
 Remember your zoom levels and color settings per site, automatically
 applying them when you return.
 .
 Disagree with what NoSquint calls a site? A powerful exceptions mechanism
 lets you split up or group together sites with URL patterns.
