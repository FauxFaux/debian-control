Description: small program managing notes from commandline
 This is a small console program similar to knotes, which
 allows you to manage notes from commandline.
 Note can use different database-backends for notes-storage.
 It ships with a DBI-based mysql-module (which can also be
 used by others through a DBI-based supported DBMS)
 and another module, which uses a binary file for storage
 and a DBM module.
