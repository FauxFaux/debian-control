Description: font support tools from the Noto Fonts project
 Noto is a collection of font families, each visually harmonized across
 scripts.

 The name "Noto" is short for "No Tofu", describing the aim of covering
 all living Unicode scripts.

 Tofu (豆腐) is Japanese jargon for unicode replacement character "�"
 (U+FFFD) often displayed as replacement for unassigned or unknown
 characters.
 .
 This package contains Python scripts used to maintain the fonts.
