Description: OpenStack Compute - NoVNC proxy
 OpenStack is a reliable cloud infrastructure. Its mission is to produce
 the ubiquitous cloud computing platform that will meet the needs of public
 and private cloud providers regardless of size, by being simple to
 implement
 and massively scalable.
 .
 OpenStack Compute, codenamed Nova, is a cloud computing fabric controller
 designed to be modular and easy to extend and adapt. In addition to its
 "native" OpenStack API, it also supports the Amazon EC2 API, and it
 supports
 many different database backends (including SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL),
 hypervisors (KVM, Xen), and user directory systems (LDAP, SQL).
 .
 This package provides the proxy for the console in Nova: either the VNC proxy,
 the SPICE HTML5 proxy, or the XVP (Xen VNC Proxy) proxy. It is a publically
 reachable component which proxies access to the console running on compute
 nodes.
