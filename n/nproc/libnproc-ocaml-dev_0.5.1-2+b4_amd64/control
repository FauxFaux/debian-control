Description: process pool implementation for OCaml
 Nproc is a process pool implementation for OCaml. A process pool is a
 fixed set of processes that perform arbitrary computations for a
 master process, in parallel and without blocking the master. Master
 and workers communicate by message-passing. Nproc relies on fork,
 pipes, Marshal and Lwt.
 .
 This package contains the development modules you need to use Nproc
 in your programs.
