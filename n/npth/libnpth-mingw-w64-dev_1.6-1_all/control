Description: replacement for GNU Pth using system threads (Windows dev)
 nPth is a non-preemptive threads implementation using an API very
 similar to the one known from GNU Pth. It has been designed as a
 replacement of GNU Pth for non-ancient operating systems. In
 contrast to GNU Pth it is based on the system's standard threads
 implementation. Thus nPth allows the use of libraries which are not
 compatible to GNU Pth.
 .
 This is a Windows version of nPth.  It's meant to be used when
 cross-building software that targets the Windows platform, e.g. the
 win32-loader component of Debian-Installer.
