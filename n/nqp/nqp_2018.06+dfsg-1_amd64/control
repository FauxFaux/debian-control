Description: Not Quite Perl compiler
 "Not Quite Perl" is a compiler for quickly generating PIR routines from
 Perl6-like code. The key feature of NQP is that it's designed to be a very
 small compiler (as compared with, say, perl6 or Rakudo) and is focused on being
 a high-level way to create compilers and libraries for virtual machines (such
 as the JVM, and MoarVM).
 .
 Unlike a full-fledged implementation of Perl 6, NQP strives to have as small a
 runtime footprint as it can, while still providing a Perl 6 object model and
 regular expression engine for the virtual machine.
