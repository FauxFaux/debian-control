Description: C# Parsing and Refactoring Library - Development files
 NRefactory is the C# analysis library used in the SharpDevelop and
 MonoDevelop IDEs. It allows applications to easily analyze both syntax
 and semantics of C# programs. It is quite similar to Microsoft's
 Roslyn project; except that it is not a full compiler â€“ NRefactory
 only analyzes C# code, it does not generate IL code.
 .
 This package contains development files for compiling against to use
 the NRefactory library.
