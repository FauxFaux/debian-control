 ns-3 is a discrete-event network simulator for Internet systems,

 and is publicly available for research, development, and use.
 ns-3 is intended as an eventual replacement for the popular
 ns-2 simulator. The project acronym “nsnam” derives
 historically from the concatenation of ns (network simulator)
 and NAM (network animator).
