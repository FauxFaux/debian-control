Description: Nagios service monitor agent - client package
 This package contains only the client part of nsca and is thus
 suitable for installation on systems that only report passive service
 checks to a central server.
 .
 Nagios is a monitoring and management system for hosts, services and
 networks.
 .
 Nagios' features include:
 .
  -  Monitoring of network services (via TCP port, SMTP, POP3, HTTP, NNTP,
     PING, etc.)
  -  Plugin interface to allow for user-developed service checks
  -  Contact notifications when problems occur and get resolved (via email,
     pager, or user-defined method)
  -  Ability to define event handlers to be run during service or host events
     (for proactive problem resolution)
  -  Web output (current status, notifications, problem history, log file,
     etc.)
 .
 Nagios was written in C and is designed to be easy to understand and modify
 to fit your own needs.
