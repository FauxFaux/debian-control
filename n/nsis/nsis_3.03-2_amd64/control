Description: Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (modified for Debian)
 NSIS is a tool for creating quick and user friendly installers for
 Microsoft Windows (Win32) operating systems.
 .
 NSIS creates installers that are capable of installing, uninstalling,
 setting system settings, extracting files, etc. Because it's based on
 script files, you can fully control every part of your installers. The
 script language supports variables, functions, string manipulation,
 just like a normal programming language - but designed for the creation
 of installers. Even with all these features, NSIS is still the smallest
 installer system available. With the default options, it has an overhead
 of only 34 KB.
