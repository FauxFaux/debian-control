Description: daemon for NSS and PAM lookups via LDAP - Python version
 This package provides a daemon for retrieving user accounts and similar
 system information from LDAP. It is used by the libnss-ldapd and
 libpam-ldapd packages but is not very useful by itself.
 .
 This is an alternative Python implementation of nslcd. Note that it is
 currently EXPERIMENTAL and has not undergone the same testing as nslcd.
