Description: network streams - a tcpdump output analyzer
 Nstreams is a utility designed to identify the IP streams that are
 occurring on a network from a non-user friendly tcpdump output of
 several megabytes. This is especially useful when you plan to install
 a firewall but if you do not know the nstreams that the network users
 are generating (http, real audio, and more...).
 .
 Nstreams can read the tcpdump output directly from stdin, or from a file.
 It can even generate the configuration file of your firewall.
