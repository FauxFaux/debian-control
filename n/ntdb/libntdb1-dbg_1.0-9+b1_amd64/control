Description: New Trivial Database - debug symbols
 This is a simple database API. It is modelled after the structure
 of GDBM. TDB features, unlike GDBM, multiple writers support with
 appropriate locking and transactions.
 .
 ntdb uses a file format that is incompatible with tdb, but the API
 is similar. It improves performance, adds support for databases
 larger than 4 Gb, and improves integration with talloc.
 .
 This package contains the debug symbols.
