Description: new transport-independent RPC library
 Port of Sun's transport-independent RPC library to Linux. The library
 is intended as a replacement for the RPC code in the GNU C library,
 providing among others support for RPC (and in turn, NFS) over IPv6.
 .
 Changes introduced in the ntirpc library include:
  * Bi-directional operation.
  * Full-duplex operation on the TCP (vc) transport.
  * Thread-safe operating modes:
    * new locking primitives and lock callouts (interface change).
    * stateless send/recv on the TCP transport (interface change).
  * Flexible server integration support.
  * Event channels.
