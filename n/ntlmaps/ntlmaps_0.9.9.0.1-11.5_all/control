Description: NTLM Authorization Proxy Server
 'NTLM Authorization Proxy Server' (APS) is a proxy software that
 allows you to authenticate via an MS Proxy Server (e.g. ISA server)
 using the proprietary NTLM protocol. Since version 0.9.5 APS has an
 ability to behave as a standalone proxy server and authenticate http

 look like they were created by MS IE. It is written in Python v1.5.2
 language.
