Description: High-Speed Web-based Traffic Analysis and Flow Collection Tool
 ntopng is the next generation version of the original ntop, a network
 traffic probe that shows the network usage, similar to what the popular
 top Unix command does. ntop is based on libpcap and it has been written
 in a portable way in order to virtually run on every Unix platform,
 MacOSX and on Win32 as well.
 .
 ntopng users can use a web browser to navigate through ntop (that acts as a
 web server) traffic information and get a dump of the network status. In the
 latter case, ntop can be seen as a simple RMON-like agent with an embedded web
 interface. The use of:
 .
  * a web interface
  * limited configuration and administration via the web interface
  * reduced CPU and memory usage (they vary according to network size and
  traffic)
 .
 What ntopng can do:
  * Sort network traffic according to many protocols
  * Show network traffic and IPv4/v6 active hosts
  * Store on disk persistent traffic statistics in RRD format
  * Geolocate hosts
  * Discover application protocols by leveraging on nDPI, ntop’s DPI
    framework
  * Characterise HTTP traffic by leveraging on characterisation services
    provided by block.si. ntopng comes with a demo characterisation key, but if
    you need a permanent one, please mail info@block.si
  * Show IP traffic distribution among the various protocols
  * Analyse IP traffic and sort it according to the source/destination
  * Display IP Traffic Subnet matrix (who’s talking to who?)
  * Report IP protocol usage sorted by protocol type
  * Act as a NetFlow/sFlow collector for flows generated by routers (e.g.
    Cisco and Juniper) or switches (e.g. Foundry Networks) when used together
    with nProbe
  * Produce HTML5/AJAX network traffic statistics
