Description: client for setting system time from NTP servers
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, or similar time signals.
 .
 ntpdate is a simple NTP client that sets a system's clock to match
 the time obtained by communicating with one or more NTP servers.  It
 is not sufficient, however, for maintaining an accurate clock in the
 long run.  ntpdate by itself is useful for occasionally setting the
 time on machines that do not have full-time network access, such as
 laptops.
 .
 This is the NTPsec version of ntpdate.  NTPsec is a secure, hardened,
 and improved implementation derived from the original NTP project.
 .
 If the full NTP daemon from the package "ntpsec" is installed, then
 ntpsec-ntpdate is not necessary.
