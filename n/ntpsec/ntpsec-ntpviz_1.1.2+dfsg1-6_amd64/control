Description: NTP statistics graphing utility
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, or similar time signals.
 .
 ntpviz analyzes NTP log files and generates statistical plots from
 them.  The output is in the form of HTML with images.  If Apache is
 installed, it will be served at: /ntpviz
 .
 This is part of NTPsec.  NTPsec is a secure, hardened, and improved
 implementation derived from the original NTP project.
