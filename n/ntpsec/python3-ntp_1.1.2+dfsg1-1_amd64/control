Description: Python 3 NTP Helper Classes
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, or similar time signals.
 .
 This package contains the Python "ntp" module, which contains helper
 classes for NTP utilities written in Python.
 .
 This is part of NTPsec.  NTPsec is a secure, hardened, and improved
 implementation derived from the original NTP project.
