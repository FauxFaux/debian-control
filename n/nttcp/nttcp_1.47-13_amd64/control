Description: New test TCP program
 This program is a much more convenient version of the ttcp program.
 It uses inetd (or simulates its behaviour) to start off the remote
 side program which will send/receive data. Both sides measure the time
 and number of bytes transfered. The local side will print the measures.
 The format of the output can be specified on the commandline.
