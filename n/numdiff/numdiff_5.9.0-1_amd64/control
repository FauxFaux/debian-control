Description: Compare similar files with numeric fields
 Numdiff is a console application that can be used to compare putatively
 similar files line by line and field by field, ignoring small numeric
 differences or/and different numeric formats. It is similar diff or wdiff,
 but it is aware of floating point numbers including complex and
 multi-precision numbers.
 Numdiff is useful to compare text files containing numerical fields, when
 testing or doing quality control in scientific computing or in numerical
 analysis.
