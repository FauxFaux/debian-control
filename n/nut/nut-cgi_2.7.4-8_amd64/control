Description: network UPS tools - web interface
 Network UPS Tools (NUT) is a client/server monitoring system that
 allows computers to share uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and
 power distribution unit (PDU) hardware. Clients access the hardware
 through the server, and are notified whenever the power status
 changes.
 .
 This package provides an HTTP interface for Network UPS Tools which makes
 it possible to monitor the core NUT system with a web browser.
