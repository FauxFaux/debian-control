Description: network UPS tools - IPMI driver
 Network UPS Tools (NUT) is a client/server monitoring system that
 allows computers to share uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and
 power distribution unit (PDU) hardware. Clients access the hardware
 through the server, and are notified whenever the power status
 changes.
 .
 This package currently provides nut-ipmipsu, a driver which allows the user to
 monitor IPMI power supply units (PSU) found in servers of popular brands, such
 as Dell, HP, IBM. It adds an IPMI interface to the core NUT system.
