Description: network UPS tools - PowerMan PDU driver
 Network UPS Tools (NUT) is a client/server monitoring system that
 allows computers to share uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and
 power distribution unit (PDU) hardware. Clients access the hardware
 through the server, and are notified whenever the power status
 changes.
 .
 This package provides powerman-pdu, which allows NUT clients to communicate
 with the PowerMan daemon to support PDUs.
