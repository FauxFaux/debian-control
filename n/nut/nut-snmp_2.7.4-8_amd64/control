Description: network UPS tools - SNMP driver
 Network UPS Tools (NUT) is a client/server monitoring system that
 allows computers to share uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and
 power distribution unit (PDU) hardware. Clients access the hardware
 through the server, and are notified whenever the power status
 changes.
 .
 This package provides snmp-ups, the SNMP multi-MIB driver for UPS, which
 supports various MIBs including IETF, MGE, and APC. It adds an SNMP
 Manager interface to the core NUT system.
