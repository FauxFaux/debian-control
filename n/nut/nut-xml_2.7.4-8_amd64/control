Description: network UPS tools - XML/HTTP driver
 Network UPS Tools (NUT) is a client/server monitoring system that
 allows computers to share uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and
 power distribution unit (PDU) hardware. Clients access the hardware
 through the server, and are notified whenever the power status
 changes.
 .
 This package provides netxml-ups, which supports UPS models from
 Eaton or MGE that use an XML/HTTP-based Network Management Card or
 Proxy.
