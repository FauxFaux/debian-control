Description: network UPS tools - metapackage
 Network UPS Tools (NUT) is a client/server monitoring system that
 allows computers to share uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and
 power distribution unit (PDU) hardware. Clients access the hardware
 through the server, and are notified whenever the power status
 changes.
 .
 This package is a metapackage that installs both nut-server and nut-client,
 in most cases it is sufficient for a basic UPS monitoring system.
