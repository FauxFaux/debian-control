Description: Fast, light-weight proxy for memcached and Redis
 nutcracker, also known as twemproxy (pronounced "two-em-proxy"), is a
 fast and lightweight proxy for the memcached and Redis protocols. It was
 primarily built to reduce the connection count on backend caching
 servers, but it has a number of features, such as:
   * Maintains persistent server connections to backend servers.
   * Enables pipelining of requests and responses.
   * Supports multiple server pools simultaneously.
   * Shard data automatically across multiple servers.
   * Supports multiple hashing modes including consistent hashing and
     distribution.
   * High-availability by disabling nodes on failures.
   * Observability through stats exposed on stats monitoring port.
