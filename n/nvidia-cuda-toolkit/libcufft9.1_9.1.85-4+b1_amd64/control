Description: NVIDIA cuFFT Library
 The Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) enables NVIDIA
 graphics processing units (GPUs) to be used for massively parallel
 general purpose computation.
 .
 The FFT is a divide-and-conquer algorithm for efficiently computing discrete
 Fourier transforms of complex or real-valued data sets. It is one of the most
 important and widely used numerical algorithms in computational physics and
 general signal processing. The cuFFT library provides a simple interface for
 computing FFTs on an NVIDIA GPU, which allows users to quickly leverage the
 floating-point power and parallelism of the GPU in a highly optimized and
 tested FFT library.
 .
 This package contains the cuFFT runtime library.
