Description: NVIDIA cuRAND Library
 The Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) enables NVIDIA
 graphics processing units (GPUs) to be used for massively parallel
 general purpose computation.
 .
 The cuRAND library provides facilities that focus on the simple and efficient
 generation of high-quality pseudorandom and quasirandom numbers.
 A pseudorandom sequence of numbers satisfies most of the statistical
 properties of a truly random sequence but is generated by a deterministic
 algorithm. A quasirandom sequence of n-dimensional points is generated by a
 deterministic algorithm designed to fill an n-dimensional space evenly.
 .
 This package contains the cuRAND runtime library.
