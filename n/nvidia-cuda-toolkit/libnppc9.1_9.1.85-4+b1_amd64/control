Description: NVIDIA Performance Primitives core runtime library
 NVIDIA NPP is a library of functions for performing CUDA accelerated
 processing.  The initial set offunctionality in the library focuses on imaging
 and video processing and is widely applicable for developers in these areas.
 NPP will evolve over time to encompass more of the compute heavy tasks in a
 variety of problem domains.  The NPP library is written to maximize
 flexibility, while maintaining high performance.
 .
 This package contains the NVIDIA Performance Primitives core runtime library.
