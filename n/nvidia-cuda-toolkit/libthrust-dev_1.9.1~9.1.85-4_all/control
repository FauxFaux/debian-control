Description: Thrust - Parallel Algorithms Library
 Thrust is a parallel algorithms library which resembles the C++ Standard
 Template Library (STL). Thrust's high-level interface greatly enhances
 programmer productivity while enabling performance portability between GPUs
 and multicore CPUs. Interoperability with established technologies (such as
 CUDA, TBB, and OpenMP) facilitates integration with existing software.
