Description: NVIDIA binary EGL core libraries (340xx legacy version)
 EGL provides a platform-agnostic mechanism for creating rendering surfaces
 for use with other graphics libraries, such as OpenGL|ES.
 .
 OpenGL|ES is a cross-platform API for full-function 2D and 3D graphics on
 embedded systems - including consoles, phones, appliances and vehicles.
 It contains a subset of OpenGL plus a number of extensions for the
 special needs of embedded systems.
 .
 This package contains the private core libraries used by the NVIDIA
 implementation of EGL and OpenGL|ES.
