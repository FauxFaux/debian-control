Description: NVIDIA binary kernel module DKMS source
 This package builds the NVIDIA Xorg binary kernel module needed by
 nvidia-driver, using DKMS.
 Provided that you have the kernel header packages installed, the kernel
 module will be built for your running kernel and automatically rebuilt for
 any new kernel headers that are installed.
 .
 The NVIDIA binary driver provides optimized hardware acceleration of
 OpenGL/GLX/EGL/GLES applications via a direct-rendering X Server
 for graphics cards using NVIDIA chip sets.
 .
 This version only supports GeForce, Quadro, NVS, Tesla, ... GPUs based on the
 Fermi, Kepler, Maxwell, or newer architectures.  Look at the legacy packages
 for older cards.
 .
 See /usr/share/doc/nvidia-kernel-dkms/README.txt.gz
 for a complete list of supported GPUs and PCI IDs.
 .
 This package contains the blobs for building kernel modules for the
 amd64 architecture.
 Building the kernel modules has been tested up to Linux 4.19.
