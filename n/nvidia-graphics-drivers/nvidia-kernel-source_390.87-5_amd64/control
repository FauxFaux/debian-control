Description: NVIDIA binary kernel module source
 This package provides the source for the NVIDIA Xorg binary kernel module
 needed by nvidia-driver in a form suitable
 for use by module-assistant or kernel-package.
 .
 The NVIDIA binary driver provides optimized hardware acceleration of
 OpenGL/GLX/EGL/GLES applications via a direct-rendering X Server
 for graphics cards using NVIDIA chip sets.
 .
 PLEASE read /usr/share/doc/nvidia-kernel-source/README.Debian.gz
 for building information.  If you want the kernel module to be automatically
 installed via DKMS, install nvidia-kernel-dkms instead.
 .
 This version only supports GeForce, Quadro, NVS, Tesla, ... GPUs based on the
 Fermi, Kepler, Maxwell, or newer architectures.  Look at the legacy packages
 for older cards.
 .
 See /usr/share/doc/nvidia-kernel-source/README.txt.gz
 for a complete list of supported GPUs and PCI IDs.
 .
 This package contains the blobs for building kernel modules for the
 amd64 architecture.
 Building the kernel modules has been tested up to Linux 4.19.
