Description: check for NVIDIA GPUs requiring a legacy driver
 This package checks whether the system contains NVIDIA GPUs that are no longer
 supported by the main driver line and require a legacy driver.

 If such hardware is present, a (preseedable) debconf question will be asked to
 confirm the installation of the current driver line.
