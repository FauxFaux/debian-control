Description: NVIDIA OpenCL ICD Loader library
 OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a multivendor open standard for
 general-purpose parallel programming of heterogeneous systems that include
 CPUs, GPUs and other processors.
 .
 The OpenCL installable client driver loader (ICD Loader) acts as a dispatcher
 between an OpenCL application and one (or more) installable client drivers
 (ICD) that can be from any vendor. At least one ICD (and the corresponding
 hardware) is required to run OpenCL applications.
 .
 This package contains the ICD Loader library provided by NVIDIA. This library
 supports OpenCL 1.x and 2.0 only.
