Description: deprecated X configuration tool for non-free NVIDIA drivers
 This tool is deprecated. The NVIDIA drivers now automatically integrate with
 the Xorg Xserver configuration. Creating an xorg.conf is no longer needed for
 normal setups.
 .
 The nvidia-xconfig program helps with manipulation of X configuration
 files, primarily for systems that use the non-free drivers provided by
 NVIDIA.  It automatically changes the configuration to use the NVIDIA
 driver and can add additional options given on the command line.
