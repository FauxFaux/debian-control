Description: Read/write coreboot-related NVRAM/CMOS information
 nvramtool is a utility for reading/writing coreboot parameters in NVRAM/CMOS
 and displaying information from the so-called 'coreboot table'.
 .
 The coreboot table resides in low physical memory. It is created at
 boot time by coreboot, and contains various system information such as
 the type of mainboard in use. It specifies locations in the NVRAM/CMOS
 (nonvolatile RAM) where the coreboot parameters are stored.
 .
 This program is mostly intended for (x86-based) systems that use coreboot, but
 can also be used for non-coreboot system (e.g. for dumping all NVRAM bytes).
 .
 For information about coreboot, see http://www.coreboot.org/.
