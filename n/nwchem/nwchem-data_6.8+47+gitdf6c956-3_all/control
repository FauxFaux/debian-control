Description: High-performance computational chemistry software (data files)
 NWChem is a computational chemistry program package.  It provides methods
 which are scalable both in their ability to treat large scientific
 computational chemistry problems efficiently, and in their use of available
 parallel computing resources from high-performance parallel supercomputers to
 conventional workstation clusters.
 .
 This package contains the basis sets, pseudopotentials and AMBER/CHARMM
 parameter files.
