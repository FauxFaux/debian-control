Description: Enhanced replacement for the write command
 Nwrite is a replacement for the standard write program that lets you write
 directly to the terminal of another logged-in user without the overhead of talk
 taking over the full screen or the other user having to respond first.
 .
 Nwrite's advantages over traditional write include the ability to send the same
 message simultaneously to multiple users, and a receiver-configurable message
 format, including a tag at the start of each line that identifies the sender.
