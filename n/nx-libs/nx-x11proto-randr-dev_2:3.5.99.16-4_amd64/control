Description: nx-X11 RandR extension wire protocol
 NX is a software suite which implements very efficient
 compression of the X11 protocol. This increases performance when
 using X applications over a network, especially a slow one.
 .
 This package provides development headers describing the wire protocol
 for the RandR extension, used to change display properties such as
 resolution, rotation, reflection, et al, on the fly.
