Description: nx-X11 Render extension wire protocol
 NX is a software suite which implements very efficient
 compression of the X11 protocol. This increases performance when
 using X applications over a network, especially a slow one.
 .
 This package provides development headers describing the wire protocol for
 the Render extension, used to implement Porter-Duff operations within X.
