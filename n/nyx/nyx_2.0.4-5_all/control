Description: terminal status monitor for tor
 The anonymizing relay monitor is a terminal status monitor for Tor relays,
 intended for command-line aficionados, ssh connections, and anyone stuck with
 a tty terminal. This works much like top does for system usage, providing real
 time statistics for:
 .
  - bandwidth, cpu, and memory usage
  - relay's current configuration
  - logged events
  - connection details (ip, hostname, fingerprint, and consensus data)
  - etc.
 .
 nyx was previously named tor-arm (which is now a transitional package).
