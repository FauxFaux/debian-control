Description: Usenet binary grabber
 nzb is a binary news grabber written in Qt 4. It natively downloads and decodes
 the files specified in the nzb file, an XML format which describes binary
 files on Usenet by their message-id. nzb provides support for direct streaming
 of media files to your favourite media player.
 .
 nzb files are a popular way to describe files posted on Usenet which span
 several messages (multi-part binaries). These files eliminate the need to
 fetch headers from newsgroups as nzb files contain the message-ids of the
 segments which can be downloaded directly from most news servers. A technical
 description can be found at http://docs.newzbin2.es/index.php/Newzbin:NZB_Specs
 .
 nzb makes Usenet downloading easy by providing an easy to use interface which
 loads up a specified nzb file and either downloads the files described in the
 nzb or streams the data to an external application. This is usually used for
 video files which results in streaming video over Usenet.
