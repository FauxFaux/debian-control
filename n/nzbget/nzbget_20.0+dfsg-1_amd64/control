Description: command-line based binary newsgrabber for nzb files
 NZBGet is a command-line based binary newsgrabber that uses nzb files as
 described in http://docs.newzbin.com/index.php/Newzbin:NZB_Specs, they are
 commonly used to describe binaries posted in the Usenet that span multiple
 posts.

 automatic par-check/-repair can use scripts to postprocess downloaded files,
