Description: next generation communication protocol for music systems
 O2 is a communication protocol for interactive music and media applications.
 It is inspired by Open Sound Control (OSC) and uses similar means to form
 addresses, specify types, and encode messages.
 .
 In addition to providing message delivery, O2 offers a discovery mechanism
 where processes automatically discover and connect to other processes.
 Furthermore, O2 implements a clock synchronization protocol.
 .
 O2 is based on IP (Internet Protocol), but there are some mechanisms that allow
 an O2 process to serve as a bridge to other networks such as Bluetooth.
