Description: Object-oriented dialect of Scheme
 Oaklisp is a dialect of Scheme that combines lexical scoping with
 first-class types.  It uses a byte-coded implementation, but is
 reasonably fast anyway.  Complete with bignums, formatted output,
 transparent delays, RnRS compatibility package; all the luxuries
 except floating point and foreign function calls.
