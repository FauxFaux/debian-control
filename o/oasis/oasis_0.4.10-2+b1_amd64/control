Description: Build-system generation for OCaml projects -- binaries
 OASIS generates a full configure, build and install system for your
 application. It starts with a simple `_oasis` file at the toplevel of your
 project and creates everything required.
 .
 It uses external tools like OCamlbuild and it can be considered as the glue
 between various subsystems that do the job. It should support the following
 tools:
 .
  - OCamlbuild
  - OMake (todo)
  - OCamlMakefile (todo),
  - ocaml-autoconf (todo)
 .
 It also features a do-it-yourself command line invocation and an internal
 configure/install scheme. Libraries are managed through findlib. It has been
 tested on GNU Linux and Windows.
 .
 OASIS supports standard entry points and descriptions. It helps to
 integrates your libraries and software with third parties tools like GODI.
 .
 This package contains command-line tools.
