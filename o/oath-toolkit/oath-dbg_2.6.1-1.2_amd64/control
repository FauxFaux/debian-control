Description: OATH Toolkit debugging symbols
 The OATH Toolkit makes it easy to build one-time password
 authentication systems.  It contains shared libraries, command line
 tools and a PAM module.  Supported technologies include the
 event-based HOTP algorithm (RFC4226) and the time-based TOTP algorithm
 (RFC6238).  OATH stands for Open AuTHentication, which is the
 organization that specify the algorithms.  For managing secret key
 files, the Portable Symmetric Key Container (PSKC) format described in
 RFC6030 is supported.
 .
 This package contains detached debugging information.  Most people
 will not need this package.  It is provided primarily to provide a
 backtrace with names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat easier to
 interpret core dumps.  GDB will find this debug information
 automatically.
