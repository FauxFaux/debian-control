Description: Free Objects for Xtallography
 FOX is a program for the ab initio structure determination from powder
 diffraction (neutrons, X-Ray). The crystal structure can be described as any
 combination of atoms, molecules or polyhedra, without a priori information
 about the connectivity of these 'building block'. Fox can make multi-pattern
 global optimizations, and automatically correct special positions.
 .
 FOX could also be used for educational purposes, to display Crystal
 Structures in 3D with the associated powder diffraction pattern.
