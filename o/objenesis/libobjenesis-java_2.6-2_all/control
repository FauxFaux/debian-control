Description: Java library to instantiate a new object of a particular class
 Objenesis is a small Java library that serves one purpose: to instantiate a
 new object of a particular class.
 Java already supports this dynamic instantiation of classes using
 Class.newInstance(). However, this only works if the class has an appropriate
 constructor. There are many times when a class cannot be instantiated this
 way, such as when the class contains:
  * Constructors that require arguments.
  * Constructors that have side effects.
  * Constructors that throw exceptions.
 As a result, it is common to see restrictions in libraries stating that
 classes must require a default constructor.
 Objenesis aims to overcomes these restrictions by bypassing the constructor
 on object instantiation.
