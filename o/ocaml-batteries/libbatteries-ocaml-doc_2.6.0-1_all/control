Description: Batteries included - OCaml development platform - documentation
 Batteries included is a community-driven effort to standardize on an
 uniform, documented, and comprehensive OCaml development platform.
 .
 Batteries included serves the following purposes:
  * define a standard set of libraries which may be expected on every
    compliant installation of OCaml
  * organize these libraries into a hierarchy of modules, with one
    source of documentation
  * define a standard set of language extensions which may be expected
    on every compliant installation of OCaml
  * provide a consistent API for otherwise independent libraries.
 .
 This package contains the documentation for batteries included: HTML
 API documentation, examples, and information about how to use
 batteries included in your programs.
