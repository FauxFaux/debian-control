Description: Erlang-style bitstrings for OCaml (runtime)
 Bitstring adds Erlang-style bitstrings and matching over bitstrings as a syntax
 extension and library for OCaml.
 .
 You can use this module to both parse and generate binary formats, files and
 protocols.
 .
 Bitstring handling is added as primitives to the language, making it simple to
 use.
 .
 Bitstring handles integers, strings, sub-bitstrings, big-, little- and
 native-endianness, signed and unsigned types, variable-width fields, fields
 with arbitrary bit alignment.
 .
 This package contains only the shared runtime stub libraries.
