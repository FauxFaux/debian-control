Description: Advanced scheduler for OCaml (Runtime library)
 Duppy is an event scheduler written for OCaml. It allows the user
 to execute tasks according to some events on unix sockets, or
 a given delay.
 .
 Several threaded queues can proceed tasks in parallel. Tasks are
 processed according to an abstract notion of priority.
 .
 This package contains only the shared runtime stub libraries.
