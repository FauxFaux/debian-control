Description: OCaml interface to the gstreamer library -- development files
 This package provides an interface to the gstreamer library for
 OCaml programmers.
 .
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.
 .
 This package contains all the development stuff you need to develop
 OCaml programs which use ocaml-gstreamer.
