Description: simple package build system for OCaml
 A parallel, incremental and declarative build system for OCaml.
 .
 The goal is to make a very simple build system for users and developers of
 OCaml libraries and programs.
 .
 Obuild acts as a building black box: users only declare what they want to
 build and with which sources; the build system will consistently build it.
 .
 The design is based on Haskell's Cabal and borrows most of the layout and
 way of working, adapting parts where necessary to fully support OCaml.
