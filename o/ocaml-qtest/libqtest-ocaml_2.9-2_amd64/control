Description: Inline (Unit) Tests for OCaml (Runtime library)
 qtest extracts inline unit tests written using a special syntax in
 comments. Those tests are then run using the oUnit framework and the
 qcheck library. The possibilities range from trivial tests -- extremely
 simple to use -- to sophisticated random generation of test cases.
