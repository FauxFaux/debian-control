Description: OCaml library for automatically resizing contiguous data structure
 This OCaml library consists of a set of modules which implement
 automatically resizing (i.e. reallocating) data structures that consume
 a contiguous part of memory.
 .
 This allows appending and removing of elements to/from arrays (both
 boxed and unboxed), strings (i.e. buffers), bit strings and weak arrays
 while still maintaining fast constant-time access to elements.
 .
 There are also functors that allow the generation of similar modules
 which use different reallocation strategies.
