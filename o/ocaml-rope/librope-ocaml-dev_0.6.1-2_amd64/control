Description: ropes ("heavyweight strings") for OCaml (Development package)
 Ropes are a scalable string implementation: they are designed for efficient
 operation that involve the string as a whole such as concatenation and
 substring. This library implements ropes for OCaml. It is rich enough to
 replace strings.
 .
 This package contains the files that are necessary to compile OCaml code
 that uses the rope library.
