Description: ropes ("heavyweight strings") for OCaml (Runtime library)
 Ropes are a scalable string implementation: they are designed for efficient
 operation that involve the string as a whole such as concatenation and
 substring. This library implements ropes for OCaml. It is rich enough to
 replace strings.
