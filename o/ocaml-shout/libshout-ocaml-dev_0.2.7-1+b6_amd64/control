Description: OCaml bindings for the shout library
 This OCaml library interfaces the shout C library which can be used for
 communicating with and sending data to Icecast and Icecast 2 streaming
 audio servers (they currently support Ogg Vorbis and MP3 audio streams).
 It handles the socket connection, the timing of the data transmission,
 and prevents bad data from getting to the server.
 .
 This package contains all the development stuff you need to use ocaml-shout
 in your programs.
