Description: type-safe, convenient SQLite database access (runtime)
 Minimalistic library and syntax extension for type-safe, convenient execution
 of SQL statements. Currently compatible with Sqlite3.
 .
 Sqlexpr features:
  * automated prepared statement caching, param binding, data extraction, error
    checking (including automatic stmt reset to avoid BUSY/LOCKED errors in
    subsequent queries), stmt finalization on db close, etc.
  * HOFs like iter, fold, transaction
  * support for different concurrency models: everything is functorized over a
    THREAD monad, so you can for instance do concurrent folds/iters with Lwt
  * support for SQL stmt syntax checks and some extra semantic checking (column
    names, etc)
 .
 This package contains the shared runtime libraries.
