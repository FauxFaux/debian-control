Description: library for dealing with sequences of Unicode characters
 OCaml-Text is an OCaml library for dealing with "text", i.e. sequences
 of Unicode characters, in a convenient way. It supports:
  * encoding/decoding of text;
  * functions for manipulation of UTF-8 encoded strings, such as
    validation and most of the functions from "List" and "String"
    modules of the OCaml standard library, adapted for UTF-8 strings;
  * locale-specific text functions (compare, upper, is_alpha, ...).
 .
 It is composed of two modules:
  * "Encoding" for encoding/decoding text
  * "Text" for text manipulation
 .
 This package contains all the development stuff you need to use the
 OCaml-Text library in your programs.
