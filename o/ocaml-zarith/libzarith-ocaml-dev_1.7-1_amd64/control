Description: arithmetic and logical operations over arbitrary-precision integers (dev)
 The Zarith library implements arithmetic and logical operations over
 arbitrary-precision integers. It uses GMP to efficiently implement
 arithmetic over big integers. Small integers are represented as Caml
 unboxed integers, for speed and space economy.
 .
 This package provides the static library, OCaml library and interface
 for developing applications to use libzarith-ocaml.
