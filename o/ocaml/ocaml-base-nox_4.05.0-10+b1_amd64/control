Description: Runtime system for OCaml bytecode executables (no X)
 Objective Caml (OCaml) is an implementation of the ML language, based on
 the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system
 and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML.
 .
 This package contains only the runtime system needed to run bytecode
 executables that do not use the graphics library. The 'ocaml' package
 contains the full development suite of Objective Caml.
