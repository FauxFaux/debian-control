Description: Sources for Objective Caml
 Objective Caml (OCaml) is an implementation of the ML language, based on
 the Caml Light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system
 and a powerful module system in the style of Standard ML.
 .
 This package contains the sources needed to build some packages which build
 depend on the OCaml source. Notice that if you want to rebuild OCaml, these
 will not work, consider using the source package instead.
