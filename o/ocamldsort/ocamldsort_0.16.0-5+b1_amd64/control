Description: dependency sorter for OCaml source files
 The ocamldsort command scans a set of Objective Caml source files (.ml
 and .mli files), sorts them according to their dependencies and prints
 the sorted files in order to link their corresponding .cmo files.
 .
 ocamldsort can be used to compile and link simple projects with one
 command.
 .
 However for larger projects where separate compilation is desirable,
 ocamldsort can also be used from within a makefile as described in the
 documentation.
