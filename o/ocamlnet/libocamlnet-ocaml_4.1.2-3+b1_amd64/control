Description: OCaml application-level Internet libraries - core runtime libraries
 Ocamlnet is a collection of OCaml libraries focusing focus on
 application-level Internet protocols and conventions.
 .
 Ocamlnet consists of the following libraries:
  * netstring: processing of strings that occur in network context
  * netcgi2: portable web applications
  * nethttpd: is a web server component (HTTP server implementation)
  * netplex: generic server framework
  * rpc: OncRPC implementation
  * netclient: clients for HTTP, FTP, and Telnet
  * equeue: event queue used for many protocol implementations
  * shell: external commands invocation
  * netshm: shared memory for IPC purposes
  * netsys: bindings for system functions
  * smtp and pop: two further client implementations
 .
 A number of ideas and concepts are used throughout the libraries:
  * netchannels are a way to abstract sequential I/O channels
  * event queues provided by equeue and unixqueue make asynchronous
    protocol interpreters possible
 .
 This package contains only the shared runtime stub libraries for the
 core Ocamlnet libraries. Stub libraries for SSL-related components are
 available in the libocamlnet-ssl-ocaml-dev package.
