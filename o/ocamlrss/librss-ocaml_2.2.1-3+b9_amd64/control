Description: RSS 2.0 parser and printer for OCaml (runtime)
 OCaml-RSS is a small OCaml library providing functions to parse and print RSS
 2.0 files. The parser can also parse some RDF files, but some fields are not
 taken into account. There is still some work to do (add missing RSS 2.0
 attributes, add convenient functions).
 .
 OCaml-RSS was previously part of Cameleon but is now developed separately
 and is findlib compatible.
