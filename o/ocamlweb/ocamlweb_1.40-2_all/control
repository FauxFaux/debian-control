Description: Literate programming tool for Objective Caml
 Literate programming, as defined by Knuth, means to combine program
 code and documentation into one source document from which program
 code and documentation can be extracted. The approach of ocamlweb is
 that documentation is to be included in the program code as special
 comments. The ocamlweb tool extracts from this the documented program
 code as LaTeX document, while no special preprocessing is required to
 compile the source files.
