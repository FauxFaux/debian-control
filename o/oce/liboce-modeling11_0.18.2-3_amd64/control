Description: OpenCASCADE Community Edition CAE platform shared library
 OpenCASCADE is a suite for 3D surface and solid modeling, visualization, data
 exchange and rapid application development.  It is an excellent platform for
 development of numerical simulation software including CAD/CAM/CAE, AEC and
 GIS, as well as PDM applications.
 .
 This package is based on OCE, OpenCASCADE Community Edition, which is
 maintained by a community of developers, and not by OpenCASCADE SAS.
 .
 This package supplies data structures to represent 2D and 3D geometric models,
 as well as topological and geometrical algorithms.
 .
 This package contains the following shared libraries:
   TKG2d TKG3d TKGeomBase TKBRep TKGeomAlgo TKTopAlgo TKPrim TKBO TKHLR
   TKMesh TKShHealing TKXMesh TKBool TKFillet TKFeat TKOffset TKSTL
   TKXSBase TKSTEPBase TKIGES TKSTEPAttr TKSTEP209 TKSTEP
