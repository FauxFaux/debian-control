Description: tools for managing OCFS2 cluster filesystems - development files
 OCFS2 is a general purpose cluster filesystem. Unlike the initial release
 of OCFS, which supported only Oracle database workloads, OCFS2 provides
 full support as a general purpose filesystem.  OCFS2 is a complete rewrite
 of the previous version, designed to work as a seamless addition to the
 Linux kernel.
