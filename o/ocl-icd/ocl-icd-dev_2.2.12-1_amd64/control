Description: Development files to build a ICD Loader
 OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a multivendor open standard for
 general-purpose parallel programming of heterogeneous systems that include
 CPUs, GPUs and other processors.
 .
 This package provides a header file that allows a OpenCL implementation
 to build a installable client driver (ICD). With a ICD, an OpenCL
 implementation can be used by any OpenCL program without the need
 to link the program to the specific OpenCL implementation.
 .
 For building OpenCL applications, installs the ocl-icd-opencl-dev package
 instead.
