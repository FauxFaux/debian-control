Description: OpenCL device simulator
 Oclgrind is an extensible OpenCL device simulator that provides a
 plugin interface to facilitate the creation of tools to aid analysis
 and development of OpenCL programs. Among the tools that Oclgrind
 provides are various debugging aids, such as out-of-bounds memory
 access checking, data-race detection, and an interactive debugger.
 .
 Oclgrind implements the OpenCL 1.2 runtime API, which makes
 simulating an existing OpenCL program very straightforward - simply
 prefix your usual application command-line with 'oclgrind'. There is
 also a simple interface for simulating individual kernels in
 isolation via the 'oclgrind-kernel' command.
