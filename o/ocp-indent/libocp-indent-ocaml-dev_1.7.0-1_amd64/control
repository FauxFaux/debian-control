Description: OCaml indentation tool for emacs and vim - development libraries
 ocp-indent is a command-line tool that allows one to indent a whole OCaml
 source code file (or parts of it) either to standard output or in-place.
 A configuration file allows user defaults as well as per-project parameters.
 The ratio of correctly indented lines is comparable with emacs tuareg mode
 while being an order of magnitude faster.
 .
 This package includes the development libraries.
