Description: simplex library for solving linear inequalities
 ocplib-simplex is a (fully) functional OCaml implementation of the
 simplex algorithm for solving systems of linear inequalities. The
 implementation is incremental and backtrackable. It is able to
 extract unsat-cores for unsatisfiable problems, and supports linear
 optimization.
