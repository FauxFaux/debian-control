Description: manipulate data in Octave similar to R data.frame
 In the R language, a dataframe object is a way to group tabular data.  The
 functions in this package allow the manipulation of data in a similar way
 in Octave.  Dataframe objects in Octave can be created in a variety of
 ways (from other objects or from tabular data in a file) and then can be
 accessed either as matrix or by column name.
 .
 This Octave add-on package is part of the Octave-Forge project.
