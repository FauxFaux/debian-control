Description: manipulate DICOM files in Octave
 Digital communications in medicine (DICOM) is an information
 standard, originally created for image transfer, which now deals with
 a large range of medical data.
 .
 This package provides functions to read and (eventually) write DICOM
 files in Octave, a scientific computation software. The functions in
 the package are intended to have similar usage as the dicom functions
 in the Matlab Image Processing Toolbox. In Octave they are separate:
 most image package users will not use dicom, and its dependency might
 be considered troublesome.
 .
 This Octave add-on package is part of the Octave-Forge project.
