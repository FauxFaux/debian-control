Description: documentation tests for Octave
 The Octave-Forge Doctest package finds specially-formatted
 blocks of example code within documentation files.  It then executes
 the code and confirms the output is correct.  This can be useful as part of
 a testing framework or simply to ensure that documentation stays up-to-date
 during software development.
 .
 This Octave add-on package is part of the Octave-Forge project.
