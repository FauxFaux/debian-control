Description: real-valued interval arithmetic for Octave
 The interval package for real-valued interval arithmetic allows
 one to evaluate functions over subsets of their domain.  All results are
 verified, because interval computations automatically keep track of any
 errors.
 .
 These concepts can be used to handle uncertainties, estimate arithmetic errors
 and produce reliable results.  Also it can be applied to computer-assisted
 proofs, constraint programming, and verified computing.
 .
 The implementation is based on interval boundaries represented by binary64
 numbers and is conforming to IEEE Std 1788-2015, IEEE standard for interval
 arithmetic.
 .
 This Octave add-on package is part of the Octave-Forge project.
