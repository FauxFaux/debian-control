Description: Large Time/Frequency Analysis Toolbox
 This package provides a Matlab/Octave toolbox for working with
 time-frequency analysis, wavelets and signal processing. It is
 intended both as an educational and a computational tool. The toolbox
 provides a large number of linear transforms including Gabor and
 wavelet transforms along with routines for constructing windows
 (filter prototypes) and routines for manipulating coefficients.
 .
 This Octave add-on package is part of the Octave-Forge project.
