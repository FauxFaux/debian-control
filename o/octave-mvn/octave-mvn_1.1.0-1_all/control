Description: multivariate normal distribution clustering for Octave
 This package contains multivariate normal distribution clustering and
 utility functions for Octave, a scientific computation software. It
 implements different divergence techniques for similarity computation
 and also include a k-means clustering method for the multivariate
 Gaussians and a method to compute native self-organizing maps for
 multivatiate Gaussians and their divergences.
 .
 This Octave add-on package is part of the Octave-Forge project.
