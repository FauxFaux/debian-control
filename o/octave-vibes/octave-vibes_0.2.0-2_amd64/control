Description: VIBes API to easily display results in Octave
 The VIBes API allows one to easily display results (boxes, pavings)
 from interval methods.
 .
 VIBes consists in two parts: (1) the VIBes application that features viewing,
 annotating and exporting figures, and (2) the VIBes API that enables your
 program to communicate with the viewer in order to draw figures.
 .
 This package integrates the VIBes API into Octave. The VIBes application
 is required for operation and must be installed separately. Data types from
 third-party interval arithmetic libraries for Octave are also supported.
 .
 This Octave add-on package is part of the Octave-Forge project.
