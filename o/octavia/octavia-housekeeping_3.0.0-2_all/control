Description: OpenStack Load Balancer Service - Housekeeping manager
 Openstack Load Balancer as a Service, codenamed Octavia was borne
 out of the Neutron LBaaS project. Its conception influenced
 the transformation of the Neutron LBaaS project, as Neutron LBaaS
 moved from version 1 to version 2. Starting with the Liberty
 release of OpenStack, Octavia has become the reference implementation
 for Neutron LBaaS version 2.
 .
 Octavia accomplishes its delivery of load balancing services by
 managing a fleet of virtual machines, containers, or bare metal
 servers—collectively known as amphorae— which it spins up on demand.
 This on-demand, horizontal scaling feature differentiates Octavia from
 other load balancing solutions, thereby making Octavia truly
 suited “for the cloud.”.
 .
 This package provides Octavia Housekeeping Manager.
