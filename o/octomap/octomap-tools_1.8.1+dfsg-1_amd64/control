Description: Tools for 3D occupancy grid mapping
 The OctoMap library implements a 3D occupancy grid mapping approach,
 providing data structures and mapping algorithms in C++ particularly suited
 for robotics. The map implementation is based on an octree and is designed
 to meet the following requirements: Full 3D model, Updatable, Flexible and
 Compact. This package contains tools to use with Octomap library.
