Description: develop, simulate and run magnetic resonance sequences
 ODIN is a framework for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
 It covers the whole toolchain of MRI, from low-level data acquisition
 to image reconstruction. In particular, it aims at rapid prototyping
 of MRI sequences. The sequences can be programmed using a high-level,
 object oriented, C++ programming interface.  It provides advanced
 sequence analysis tools, such as interactive plotting of k-space
 trajectories, a user interface for a fast compile-link-test cycle
 and a powerful MRI simulator which supports different virtual samples.
 For fast and flexible image reconstruction, ODIN contains a highly
 customizable, multi-threaded data-processing framework.
