Description: tool to convert proprietary bank statement to OFX format
 Most internet banking systems are capable of exporting account transactions to
 some sort of computer readable formats, but few supports standard data formats,
 like OFX. On the other hand, personal accounting tools, such as GnuCash support
 standard formats only, and will probably never support proprietary statement
 formats of online banking systems.
 .
 Ofxstatement is a tool to convert proprietary bank statement to OFX format,
 suitable for importing to GnuCash
