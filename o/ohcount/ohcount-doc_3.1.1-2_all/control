Description: Source code line counter - Documentation
 Ohcount supports over 70 popular programming languages.
 Ohcount does more than just count lines of code. It can also detect
 popular open source licenses such as GPL within a large directory of source
 code. It can also detect code that targets a particular programming API,
 such as Win32 or KDE.
 Ohcount is the line counter which powers http://www.openhub.net/
 .
