Description: replacement ident daemon
 An ident (rfc1413) daemon for IPv4 and IPv6.
 .
 Oidentd allows users, given the proper permission, to specify the
 identd response that the server will output when a successful lookup
 is completed.  Oidentd also allows for pseudo-random strings
 (either a prefix, such as "user," followed by a number between 0 and
 99999, or 10 pseudo-random characters of the  set 0-9A-Za-z) to be
 returned  upon the completion of a successful lookup instead of a
 username or a UID.
 .
 Oidentd supports IPv4 masqueraded connections, including netfilter.
