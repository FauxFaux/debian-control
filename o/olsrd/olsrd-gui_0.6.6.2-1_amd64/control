Description: GTK GUI to control and get info about olsrd
 olsrd-gui is a GTK GUI for controlling and getting information from a running
 olsrd, a daemon for OLSR mesh networking.  It uses IPC to talk to olsrd, so
 /etc/olsrd/olsrd.conf must enable IPC connections for olsrd-gui to work.
 .
 OLSR operates as a table driven, proactive protocol, i.e., it exchanges
 topology information with other nodes of the network regularly. It is
 developed to work independently from other protocols. Likewise, OLSR makes no
 assumptions about the underlying link-layer.
