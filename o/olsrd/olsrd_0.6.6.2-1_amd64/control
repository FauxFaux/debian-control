Description: optimized link-state routing daemon (unik-olsrd)
 unik-olsrd is an implementation of the Optimized Link State Routing protocol
 for Mobile Ad-Hoc networks(MANET). The protocol is described in RFC3626. It
 is designed to be run as a standalone server process.
 .
 OLSR operates as a table driven, proactive protocol, i.e., it exchanges
 topology information with other nodes of the network regularly. It is
 developed to work independently from other protocols. Likewise, OLSR makes no
 assumptions about the underlying link-layer.
