Description: omniORB event service
 omniEvents enables CORBA applications to communicate through
 asynchronous broadcast channels rather than direct method calls. It
 is a small, efficient implementation of the Object Management Group's
 Event Service specification designed to work with omniORB.
 .
 This package contains the CORBA Event Service daemon as a standalone
 executable, and the associated tools.
