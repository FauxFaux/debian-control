Description: Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) development files
 The Open Motion Planning Library is a set of sampling-based motion
 planning algorithms. The content of the library is limited to these
 algorithms, which means there is no environment specification, no
 collision detection, and no visualization. The library is designed so
 it can be easily integrated into systems that provide those
 additional components. This package contains the development files
 needed to use the library.
