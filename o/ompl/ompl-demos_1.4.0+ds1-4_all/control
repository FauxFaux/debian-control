Description: Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) demos
 The Open Motion Planning Library is a set of sampling-based motion
 planning algorithms. The content of the library is limited to these
 algorithms, which means there is no environment specification, no
 collision detection or visualization. The library is designed so it
 can be easily integrated into systems that provide the additional
 needed components.  This package contains a set of demos of the
 library.
