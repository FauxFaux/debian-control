Description: Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) plannerarena
 The Open Motion Planning Library is a set of sampling-based motion
 planning algorithms. The content of the library is limited to these
 algorithms, which means there is no environment specification, no
 collision detection or visualization. The library is designed so it
 can be easily integrated into systems that provide the additional
 needed components.
 .
 This package contains an script that launches a web server locally
 to analyze SQLite3 benchmark databases. The benchmark databases are
 created with ompl_benchmark_statistics library.
