Description: cat chases the cursor (now a mouse) around the screen
 A cat (neko) chases the cursor (now a mouse) around the screen while
 you work.  Alternatively, a dog chases a bone. There are menu options
 for starting and stopping the program easily on cat and dog modes.
 Other variations and detailed configurations are available through
 command line options.
