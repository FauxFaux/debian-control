Description: fast and simple SNMP scanner
 onesixtyone is a simple SNMP scanner which sends SNMP requests for the
 sysDescr value asynchronously with user-adjustable sending times and
 then logs the responses which gives the description of the software
 running on the device.
 .
 Running onesixtyone on a class B network (switched 100Mbs with 1Gbs
 backbone) with -w 10 gives a performance of 3 seconds per class C, with
 no dropped packets, and all 65536 IP addresses were scanned in less than
 13 minutes.
