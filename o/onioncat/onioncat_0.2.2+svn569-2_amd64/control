Description: IP-Transparent Tor hidden service connector
 OnionCat creates a transparent IP layer on top of Tor hidden
 services. It transparently transmits any kind of IP-based data
 through the Tor network on a location hidden basis. You can think of
 it as a point-to-multipoint VPN between hidden services.
 .
 OnionCat is a stand-alone application which runs in userland and is a
 connector between Tor and the local OS. Any protocol based on IP,
 such as UDP or TCP, can be transmitted.
 .
 OnionCat supports IPv6; native IPv4 forwarding, though still
 available, is deprecated: the recommended solution for IPv4
 forwarding is to build a IPv4-through-IPv6 tunnel through OnionCat.
