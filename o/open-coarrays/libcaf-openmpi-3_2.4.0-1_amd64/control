Description: Co-Array Fortran libraries for gfortran (OpenMPI)
 OpenCoArrays is an open-source software project that supports the
 coarray Fortran (CAF) parallel programming features of the Fortran 2008
 standard and several features proposed for Fortran 2015 in the draft
 Technical Specification [TS 18508] "Additional Parallel Features in Fortran".
 .
 This package provides the libraries necessary for gfortran to build parallel
 CAF programs built on top of OpenMPI.
