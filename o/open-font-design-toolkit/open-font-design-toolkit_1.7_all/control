Description: metapackage for open font design
 This package provides all tools needed to design, adapt, improve and
 hack on open fonts, including recommendations for the ones needed to
 do font design in a collaborative manner using VCS (version control
 systems).
 .
 A growing number of high-quality fonts are released under the Open Font
 License (or similar recognized font-specific licenses) to allow distributing,
 modifying, improving and branching by others including adding new glyphs and
 smart behaviours, extending the Unicode coverage, improving hinting and
 allowing new languages to be supported on the free desktop and, of course,
 fixing bugs.
 .
 The various OFL'ed fonts are listed at http://scripts.sil.org/OFL_fonts and at
 http://unifont.org/fontguide
 .

 implementations and packaging can be found on these website from the open font
