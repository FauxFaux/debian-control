Description: Space Invaders clone
 Space Invaders is one of the earliest arcade shoot 'em up games. The player
 can move horizontally across the bottom of the screen and must shoot at an
 incoming wave of aliens before they reach the bottom.
 .
 Open Invaders is a clone of the legendary 70's classic, but with
 completely new graphics, several bonus levels, etc.
