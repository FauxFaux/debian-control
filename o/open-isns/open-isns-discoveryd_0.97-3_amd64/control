Description: Internet Storage Name Service - iSNS discovery daemon
 Open-iSNS is an implementation of the Internet Storage Name Service
 (iSNS), according to RFC 4171, which facilitates automated discovery,
 management, and configuration of iSCSI and Fibre Channel devices on a
 TCP/IP network.
 .
 This package contains the isnsdd discovery daemon, handling all the
 server communications required to register a node, its portals, and to
 maintain the registration. In addition, it uses the iSNS State Change
 Notification framework to learn of new targets or initiators coming
 online and informs local services (such as the iSCSI initiator daemon)
 about these changes.
