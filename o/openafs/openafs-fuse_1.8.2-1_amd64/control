Description: AFS distributed file system experimental FUSE client
 AFS is a distributed filesystem allowing cross-platform sharing of
 files among multiple computers.  Facilities are provided for access
 control, authentication, backup and administrative management.
 .
 This package provides an experimental FUSE implementation of the AFS
 client as afsd.fuse.  This currently only provides read-only access to
 AFS, doesn't work with all of the normal AFS client programs, and must be
 started manually, but may be of interest in situations where read-only
 access is sufficient and the kernel module cannot be built.
