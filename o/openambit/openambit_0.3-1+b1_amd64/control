Description: utilities for Suunto Ambit sport watches
 This package provides software that helps communicating with Suunto Ambit
 outdoor watches.
 .
 OpenAmbit offers the following features:
  - Read logs from device and save them in XML files;
  - Upload logs to movescount.com;
  - Update orbital data (for faster GPS sync) to the device.
 .
 It doesn't have the following features (but may include them in future
 releases):
  - Sync user settings from movescount to device;
  - Sync apps, routes etc from movescount to device.
 .
 The application is divided in 2 parts, libambit which is a basic
 C-library that does the device-communication, and the openambit GUI
 application that writes the logs to XML files and synchronize with
 movescount. The movescount parts is completely optional, and needs
 to be manually enabled in the UI.
 .
 This package provides the GUI interface.
