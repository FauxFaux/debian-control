Description: Optimized BLAS (linear algebra) library (development files)
 OpenBLAS is an optimized BLAS library based on GotoBLAS2 1.13 BSD version.

 Unlike Atlas, OpenBLAS provides a multiple architecture library.
 .
 All kernel will be included in the library and dynamically switched to
 the best architecture at run time (only on x86 arches).
 .
 This package includes the static libraries and symbolic links
 needed for program development.
