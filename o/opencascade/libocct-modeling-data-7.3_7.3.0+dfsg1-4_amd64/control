Description: Open CASCADE Technology 2D/3D geometric primitives data structures
 Open CASCADE Technology is a suite for 3D surface and solid modeling,
 visualization, data exchange and rapid application development.  It is an
 excellent platform for development of numerical simulation software including
 CAD/CAM/CAE, AEC and GIS, as well as PDM applications.
 .
 This package supplies data structures to represent 2D and 3D geometric models.
 .
 This package contains the following shared libraries:
   TKG2d TKG3d TKGeomBase TKBRep
