Description: MPEG2 transport stream data generator and packet manipulator
 OpenCaster is a collection of tools for Linux system to play out and
 multiplex MPEG2 transport stream format.
 .
 Use-cases:
  - MHP, MHEG5, HbbTv and others interactive tv standards object carousel
    broadcast
  - Playout of locally stored, offline encoded audio and video for non-live
    tv and radio stations
  - Multiplexing of input multicasted UDP transport stream to output
    multicasted UDP transport stream
  - VOD system based on mpeg2 transport stream over IP or over DVB for
    walled garden network like hotels with coax or ethernet.
  - DVB-SSU update
  - Data casting
  - IP encapsualtor
  - PSI/SI generator
  - EPG generator
 .
 OpenCaster output has been successfully integrated with a long list of
 dvb products, among them there are products by Cisco/Scientific Atlanta,
 Ericsson/Tandberg, Dektec, Eurotek, Harmonic/Scopus, MainConcept, Mitan,
 Screen Service, Adtec, Wellav, Sr-Systems, Deltacast, ...
 Integration is tested and available on the Avalpa Broadcast Server
 .
 OpenCaster has been tested with Rohde & Schwarz DVM100L, Rohde & Schwarz
 DVM 400, Dektec StreamXpert and a countless number of set top boxes,
 digital receivers and flat panels
 .
