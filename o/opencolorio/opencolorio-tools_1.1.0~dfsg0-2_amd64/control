Description: complete color management solution - utilities
 OpenColorIO (OCIO) is a complete color management solution geared
 towards motion picture production with an emphasis on visual effects
 and computer animation. OCIO provides a straightforward and consistent
 user experience across all supporting applications while allowing for
 sophisticated back-end configuration options suitable for high-end
 production usage. OCIO is compatible with the Academy Color Encoding
 Specification (ACES) and is LUT-format agnostic, supporting many
 popular formats.
 .
 OpenColorIO is released as version 1.0 and has been in development
 since 2003. OCIO represents the culmination of years of production
 experience earned on such films as SpiderMan 2 (2004), Surf's Up
 (2007), Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (2009), Alice in Wonderland
 (2010), and many more. OpenColorIO is natively supported in commercial
 applications like Katana, Mari, Silhouette FX, and others coming soon.
 .
 OpenColorIO is free and is one of several open source projects
 actively sponsored by Sony Imageworks.
