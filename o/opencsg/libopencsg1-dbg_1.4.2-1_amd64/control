Description: debugging symbols for libopencsg
 OpenCSG is a library for CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) that can combine
 geometric primitives to more complex objects, for example the difference
 between two primitives. Instead of explicitly calculating the shape of the
 resulting object, it uses OpenGL's z-buffer to render the image.
 .
 OpenCSG implements both the Goldfeather and the SCS algorithm.
 .
 This package contains the debugging symbols for libopencsg.
