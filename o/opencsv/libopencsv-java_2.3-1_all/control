Description: opencsv - Library for reading and writing CSV in Java
 Opencsv is a very simple csv (comma-separated values) parser library for Java.
 It supports all the basic csv-type things you're likely to want to do:
 .
  * Arbitrary numbers of values per line
  * Ignoring commas in quoted elements
  * Handling quoted entries with embedded carriage returns
    (ie entries that span multiple lines)
  * Configurable separator and quote characters (or use sensible defaults)
  * Read all the entries at once, or use an Iterator style model
  * Creating csv files from String[] (ie. automatic escaping of embedded
    quote chars)
