Description: Headers and development libraries for the OpenDMARC library
 Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC),
 builds on the successes of technologies such as DomainKeys Identified Mail
 (DKIM) and the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) to create an infrastructure that
 enforces policy on domain names that are visible to end users, and creates a
 feedback framework for identifying and tracking fraudulent use of domain
 names in email.
 .
 This package provides the required header files and development libraries for
 developing against the OpenDMARC library.
