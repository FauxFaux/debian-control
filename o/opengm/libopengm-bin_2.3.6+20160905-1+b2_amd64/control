Description: command line tools for OpenGM
 OpenGM is a C++ template library for discrete factor graph models and
 distributive operations on these models.
 .
 It includes state-of-the-art optimization and inference algorithms beyond
 message passing. OpenGM handles large models efficiently, is modular and
 extendible. The graphical model data structure, inference algorithms and
 different encodings of functions inter-operate through well-defined
 interfaces. The binary OpenGM file format is based on the HDF5 standard and
 incorporates user extensions automatically.
 .
 This package contains the commandline interface to the OpenGM library.
