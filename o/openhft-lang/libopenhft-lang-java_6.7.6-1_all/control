Description: High Performance Java library for High Frequency Trading
 This library provides marshalling, de-marshalling and handling
 of thread safe off heap memory through ByteBuffers. It is designed
 to be largely GC-less such that millions of entries with 32 MB heap can be
 queued without triggering the garbage collector.
