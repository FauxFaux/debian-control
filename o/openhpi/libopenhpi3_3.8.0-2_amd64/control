Description: OpenHPI libraries (runtime and support files)
 OpenHPI is an implementation of the Service Availability Forum's Hardware
 Platform Interface specification.  (See http://www.saforum.org)  As
 such, OpenHPI facilitates the development of computer manageability
 applications which are not tied to a single hardware vendor's products.
 .
 This package contains the runtime libraries and support files needed by
 an application program that uses OpenHPI.  As a packaging convenience,
 this base library also includes the watchdog and simulator plugin
 modules.
