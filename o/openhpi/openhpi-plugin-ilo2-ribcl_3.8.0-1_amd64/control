Description: OpenHPI plugin module for HP's ProLiant rackmount servers
 OpenHPI is an implementation of the Service Availability Forum's Hardware
 Platform Interface specification.  (See http://www.saforum.org)  As
 such, OpenHPI facilitates the development of computer manageability
 applications which are not tied to a single hardware vendor's products.
 .
 This package contains a plugin module that provides hardware information
 from many HP ProLiant rackmount servers, accessing this information
 using RIBCL to an iLO2, over a LAN.
