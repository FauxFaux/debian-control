Description: OpenHPI plugin module for direct IPMI over LAN (RMCP) or SMI
 OpenHPI is an implementation of the Service Availability Forum's Hardware
 Platform Interface specification.  (See http://www.saforum.org)  As
 such, OpenHPI facilitates the development of computer manageability
 applications which are not tied to a single hardware vendor's products.
 .
 This package contains a plugin module that accesses hardware information
 with direct IPMI commands over a LAN (RMCP) or through the local SMI.
