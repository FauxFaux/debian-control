Description: OpenHPI plugin module for HPE's BladeSystem c-Class
 OpenHPI is an implementation of the Service Availability Forum's Hardware
 Platform Interface specification.  (See http://www.saforum.org)  As
 such, OpenHPI facilitates the development of computer manageability
 applications which are not tied to a single hardware vendor's products.
 .
 This package contains a plugin module that provides hardware information
 from HP BladeSystem c-Class enclosures, accessing this information using
 SOAP/XML to an Onboard Administrator module, over a LAN.
