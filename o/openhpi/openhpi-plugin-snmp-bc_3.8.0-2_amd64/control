Description: OpenHPI plugin module for IBM's BladeCenter or RSA over SNMP
 OpenHPI is an implementation of the Service Availability Forum's Hardware
 Platform Interface specification.  (See http://www.saforum.org)  As
 such, OpenHPI facilitates the development of computer manageability
 applications which are not tied to a single hardware vendor's products.
 .
 This package contains a plugin module that accesses IBM BladeCenter
 and RSA-enabled systems hardware information through SNMP.
