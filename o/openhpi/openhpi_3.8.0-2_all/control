Description: SAF's HPI: Abstracted interface for managing computer hardware
 OpenHPI is an implementation of the Service Availability Forum's Hardware
 Platform Interface (HPI) specification.  (See http://www.saforum.org)
 As such, OpenHPI facilitates the development of computer manageability
 applications which are not tied to a single hardware vendor's products.
 .
 HPI provides an abstracted interface for managing computer hardware,
 typically for chassis and rack based servers. HPI includes resource
 modeling; access to and control over sensor, control, watchdog, and
 inventory data associated with resources; abstracted System Event Log
 interfaces; hardware events and alerts; and a managed hotswap interface.
 .
 This package is a metapackage which installs all of the OpenHPI
 components.
