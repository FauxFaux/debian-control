Description: OpenHPI daemon, supports gathering of manageability information
 OpenHPI is an implementation of the Service Availability Forum's Hardware
 Platform Interface specification.  (See http://www.saforum.org)  As
 such, OpenHPI facilitates the development of computer manageability
 applications which are not tied to a single hardware vendor's products.
 .
 This package contains the OpenHPI daemon.  This process gathers
 information from managed hardware and systems, making this available
 to OpenHPI-based applications.
