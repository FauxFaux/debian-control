Description: Jazz Jackrabbit™ game engine reimplementation
 OpenJazz is a free, open-source version of the classic Jazz Jackrabbit™ games.
 .
 Jazz Jackrabbit™ is a PC platform game. Produced by Epic Games (then Epic
 MegaGames), it was first released in 1994. The fast-paced, colourful gameplay
 proved popular, and the game won PC Format's Arcade Game of the Year award.
 Many people still fondly recall the shareware versions.
 .
 With the demise of DOS-based operating systems, it has become necessary to use
 emulators to play old DOS games. Jazz Jackrabbit™ deserves more - and would
 benefit greatly from new features.
 .
 To play, you will need the files from one of the original games. Current
 releases of `game-data-packager' are able to generate a suitable data package
 from the Jazz Jackrabbit Collection as published on GOG.
