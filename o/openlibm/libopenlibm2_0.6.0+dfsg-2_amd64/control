Description: standalone implementation of C mathematical functions (shared library)
 OpenLibm is an effort to have a high quality, portable, standalone libm
 implementation, under a liberal free software license. It can be used
 standalone in applications and programming language implementations.
 .
 The project was born out of a need to have a good libm for the Julia
 programming language that worked consistently across compilers and operating
 systems, and in 32-bit and 64-bit environments.
 .
 This package contains a shared version of the library.
