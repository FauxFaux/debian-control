Description: Structured Storage Explorer
 OpenMCDF is a 100% managed CLI component that allows client applications to
 manipulate COM structured storage files, also known as Microsoft Compound
 Document Format files.
 .
 This file format is used under the hood by a lot of applications: the files
 created by Microsoft Office until the 2007 product release are all structured
 storage files. They include multiple streams of information (document summary,
 user data) in a single physical container (the file). Also the omnipresent
 Thumbs.db, used by Windows as thumbnails cache, is a structured storage file.
 .
 OpenMCDF makes available to the developer an easy interface to read, write, add
 and remove structured storage primitives. Structured storage items are
 organized in a hierarchical tree where 'storage' nodes act like a directory and
 'stream' nodes like a file. Developers can use OpenMCDF to view storages and
 streams, traverse hierarchical trees of items, explore existing compound file
 and modify them or create a new compound file from scratch.
