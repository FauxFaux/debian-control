Description: high performance message passing library -- binaries
 Open MPI is a project combining technologies and resources from several other
 projects (FT-MPI, LA-MPI, LAM/MPI, and PACX-MPI) in order to build the best
 MPI library available. A completely new MPI-3.1 compliant implementation, Open
 MPI offers advantages for system and software vendors, application developers
 and computer science researchers.
 .
 Features:
  * Full MPI-3.1 standards conformance
  * Thread safety and concurrency
  * Dynamic process spawning
  * High performance on all platforms
  * Reliable and fast job management
  * Network and process fault tolerance
  * Support network heterogeneity
  * Single library supports all networks
  * Run-time instrumentation
  * Many job schedulers supported
  * Internationalized error messages
  * Component-based design, documented APIs
 .
 This package contains the Open MPI utility programs.
