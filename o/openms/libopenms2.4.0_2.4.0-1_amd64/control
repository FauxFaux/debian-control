Description: library for LC/MS data management and analysis - runtime
 OpenMS is a library for LC/MS data management and analysis. OpenMS
 offers an infrastructure for the development of mass
 spectrometry-related software and powerful 2D and 3D visualization
 solutions.
 .
 OpenMS offers analyses for various quantitation protocols, including
 label-free quantitation, SILAC, iTRAQ, SRM, SWATH…
 .
 It provides built-in algorithms for de-novo identification and
 database search, as well as adapters to other state-of-the art tools
 like X!Tandem, Mascot, OMSSA…
 .
 OpenMS supports the Proteomics Standard Initiative (PSI) formats for
 MS data and supports easy integration of tools into workflow engines
 like Knime, Galaxy, WS-Pgrade, and TOPPAS via the TOPPtools concept
 and a unified parameter handling.
