Description: tools for manipulating floppy disk images in the dmk format
 Emulators such as OpenMSX attempt to emulate a real machine as best as
 possible. Some copy protection schemes rely on unformatted or bad sectors on
 floppy disks. The dmk format allows disk images to contain such unusual
 configurations. This package contains tools for generating and manipulating
 dmk image files.
