Description: Manage services
 ONE (OpenNebula) extends the benefits of virtualization platforms from a
 single physical resource to a pool of resources, decoupling the server not
 only from the physical infrastructure but also from the physical location.
 .
 OneFlow allows users and administrators to define, execute and manage
 multi-tiered applications, or services composed of interconnected Virtual
 Machines with deployment dependencies between them. Each group of Virtual
 Machines is deployed and managed as a single entity, and is completely
 integrated with the advanced OpenNebula user and group management.
 .
 Benefits:
  * Define multi-tiered applications (services) as collection of applications
  * Manage multi-tiered applications as a single entity
  * Automatic execution of services with dependencies
  * Provide configurable services from a catalog and self-service portal
  * Enable tight, efficient administrative control
  * Fine-grained access control for the secure sharing of services with
    other users
  * Auto-scaling policies based on performance metrics and schedule
 .
 This package provides the server that allows service management.
