Description: send information to OpenNebula from the Virtual Machines
 ONE (OpenNebula) extends the benefits of virtualization platforms from a
 single physical resource to a pool of resources, decoupling the server not
 only from the physical infrastructure but also from the physical location.
 .
 OneGate allows Virtual Machine guests to push monitoring information to
 OpenNebula. Users and administrators can use it to gather metrics, detect
 problems in their applications, and trigger OneFlow auto-scaling rules
 .
 This package provides the server part to enable communication between the
 Virtual Machines and OpenNebula
