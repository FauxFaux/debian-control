Description: web interface to which executes the OpenNebula cluster services
 OpenNebula is an open source virtual infrastructure engine that enables the
 dynamic deployment and re-placement of virtual machines on a pool of physical
 resources.
 .
 ONE (OpenNebula) extends the benefits of virtualization platforms from a
 single physical resource to a pool of resources, decoupling the server not
 only from the physical infrastructure but also from the physical location.
 .
 OpenNebula Sunstone is the new OpenNebula Cloud Operations Center,
 a GUI intended for users and admins, that will simplify the typical management
 operations in private and hybrid cloud infrastructures. You will be able to
 manage your virtual resources in a similar way as you do with the
 CLI.
