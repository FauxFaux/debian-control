Description: Ruby bindings for OpenNebula Cloud API (OCA)
 OpenNebula is an open source virtual infrastructure engine that enables the
 dynamic deployment and re-placement of virtual machines on a pool of physical
 resources.
 .
 ONE (OpenNebula) extends the benefits of virtualization platforms from a
 single physical resource to a pool of resources, decoupling the server not
 only from the physical infrastructure but also from the physical location.
 .
 This package provides the OpenNebula Cloud API (OCA) Ruby bindings.
