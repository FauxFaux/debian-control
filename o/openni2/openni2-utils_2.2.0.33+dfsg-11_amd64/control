Description: debug and test utilities OpenNI2 framework
 OpenNI2 is a framework for getting data to support 'Natural Interaction',
 i.e. skeleton tracking, gesture tracking, and similar ways of getting data
 from humans. OpenNI2 provides the interface for physical devices and for
 middleware components. The API enables modules to be registered in the OpenNI2
 framework, which then produce sensory data. OpenNI2 also allows selection of
 different hardware and middleware modules.
 .
 This package provides a number of related utilities for debugging, testing,
 and view the results of the sensor modules.
