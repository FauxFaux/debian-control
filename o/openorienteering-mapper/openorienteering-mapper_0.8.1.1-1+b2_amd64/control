Description: Orienteering map drawing application
 OpenOrienteering Mapper is an application to draw maps for forest,
 sprint, MTB and radio orienteering races. It comes with predefined
 symbol sets implementing the IOF standards ISOM (1:15000, 1:10000)
 and ISSOM (1:5000, 1:4000). It is easy to implement additional symbol
 sets.
 .
 It provides a Free alternative to existing proprietary map drawing
 applications and supports multiple platforms. It is available for
 Android, Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.
 .
 While it is under continuous development and considered in beta
 state, it has been used to produce maps for orienteering races. All
 required functions for drawing maps are implemented and the program
 works very stable. So it can be considered ready for productive use,
 although it is like always a good idea to keep backups of your files.
