Description: dependency based service manager (pretty console display development)
 OpenRC is a dependency based service manager. It provides support for System V
 init, for booting, changing runlevels, starting and stopping services, and
 shutting down.
 .
 Originally written as a Gentoo project, OpenRC aims at being
 platform-agnostic.  It works equally well on Linux, BSD and Hurd.
 It supports the traditional init system in Debian in addition to many
 alternatives.  OpenRC is implemented in C in a small, simple and
 efficient way, making it easy to understand, extend and reuse.
 .
 This package provides a development library that supports displaying messages
 on the console.
