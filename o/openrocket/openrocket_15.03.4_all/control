Description: Model Rocket Simulator
 OpenRocket is a free, fully featured model rocket simulator that allows
 you to design and simulate your rockets before actually building and
 flying them.
 .
 OpenRocket features a full six-degree-of-freedom simulation, realistic
 wind modeling, a multitude of different components including free-form
 and canted fins, clustering and staging.
 .
 This package therefore downloads the pre-built OpenRocket .jar file from
 the upstream site and installs it.
