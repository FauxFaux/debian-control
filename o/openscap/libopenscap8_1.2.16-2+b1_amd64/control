Description: Set of libraries enabling integration of the SCAP line of standards
 OpenSCAP is a set of open source libraries providing an easier path
 for integration of the SCAP line of standards. SCAP is a line of
 standards managed by NIST with the goal of providing a standard language
 for the expression of Computer Network Defense related information.
 .
 The intended scope of this project is to implement working interface
 wrappers for parsing and querying SCAP content including:
  * Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
  * Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE)
  * Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)
  * Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
  * Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF)
  * Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL)
