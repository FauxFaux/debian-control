Description: 3D scene graph, development files
 A portable, high level graphics toolkit for the development of high performance
 graphics applications such as flight simulators, games, virtual reality or
 scientific visualization.  Providing an object orientated framework on top of
 OpenGL, it frees the developer from implementing and optimizing low level
 graphics calls, and provide many additional utilities for rapid development of
 graphics applications.
