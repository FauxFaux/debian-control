Description: CPL module (CPL interpreter engine) for OpenSIPS
 OpenSIPS is a very fast and flexible SIP (RFC3261)
 server. Written entirely in C, OpenSIPS can handle thousands calls
 per second even on low-budget hardware.
 .
 This package provides a CPL (Call Processing Language) interpreter for
 OpenSIPS, turning OpenSIPS into a CPL server (storage and interpreter).
