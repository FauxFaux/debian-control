Description: Support for JSON handling in OpenSIPS script
 OpenSIPS is a very fast and flexible SIP (RFC3261)
 server. Written entirely in C, OpenSIPS can handle thousands calls
 per second even on low-budget hardware.
 .
 This package introduces a new type of variable that provides both
 serialization and de-serialization from JSON format. The script variable
 provides ways to access (from script) objects and arrays to add,replace or
 delete values from the script.
