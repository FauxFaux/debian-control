Description: LDAP modules for OpenSIPS
 OpenSIPS is a very fast and flexible SIP (RFC3261)
 server. Written entirely in C, OpenSIPS can handle thousands calls
 per second even on low-budget hardware.
 .
 This package provides the ldap and h350 modules for OpenSIPS, enabling LDAP
 queries from the OpenSIPS config and storage of SIP account data in an LDAP
 directory.
