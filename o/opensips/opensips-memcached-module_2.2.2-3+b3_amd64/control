Description: Interface module to interact with a memcached server
 OpenSIPS is a very fast and flexible SIP (RFC3261)
 server. Written entirely in C, OpenSIPS can handle thousands calls
 per second even on low-budget hardware.
 .
 This package provides an implementation of a cache system designed to work
 with a memcached server. It uses libmemcached client library to connect to
 several memcached servers that store data. It registers the three functions for
 storing, fetching and removing a value to the core memcache management
 interface.
