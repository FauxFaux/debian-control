Description: Interface module to interact with a RabbitMQ server
 OpenSIPS is a very fast and flexible SIP (RFC3261)
 server. Written entirely in C, OpenSIPS can handle thousands calls
 per second even on low-budget hardware.
 .
 This package provides the implementation of a RabbitMQ client for the Event
 Interface. It is used to send AMQP messages to a RabbitMQ server each time
 the Event Interface triggers an event subscribed for.
