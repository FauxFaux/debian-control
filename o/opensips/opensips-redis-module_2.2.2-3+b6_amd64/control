Description: Interface module to interact with a Redis server
 OpenSIPS is a very fast and flexible SIP (RFC3261)
 server. Written entirely in C, OpenSIPS can handle thousands calls
 per second even on low-budget hardware.
 .
 This package provides an implementation of a cache system designed to
 work with a Redis server. It uses hiredis client library to connect
 to either a single Redis server instance, or to a Redis Server inside
 a Redis Cluster. It uses the Key-Value interface exported from the core.
