Description: Manipulation and conversion tools for OpenSlide
 OpenSlide is a C library that provides a simple interface to read whole-slide
 images also known as virtual slides.
 .
 Whole-slide images, also known as virtual slides, are large, high resolution
 images used in digital pathology. Reading these images using standard image
 tools or libraries is a challenge because these tools are typically designed
 for images that can comfortably be uncompressed into RAM or a swap file.
 Whole-slide images routinely exceed RAM sizes, often occupying tens of
 gigabytes when uncompressed. Additionally, whole-slide images are typically
 multi-resolution, and only a small amount of image data might be needed at a
 particular resolution.
 .
 This library currently supports:
  - Aperio (.svs, .tif)
  - Hamamatsu (.vms, .vmu, .ndpi)
  - Leica (.scn)
  - MIRAX (.mrxs)
  - Sakura (.svslide)
  - Trestle (.tif)
  - Generic tiled TIFF (.tif)
 .
 This package contains command line tools for file manipulation.
