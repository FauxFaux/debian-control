Description: collection of special mathematical functions (development files)
 Openspecfun provides AMOS and Faddeeva.
 .
 AMOS (from Netlib) is a portable package for Bessel Functions of a Complex
 Argument and Nonnegative Order; it contains subroutines for computing Bessel
 functions and Airy functions.
 .
 Faddeeva allows computing the various error functions of arbitrary complex
 arguments (Faddeeva function, error function, complementary error function,
 scaled complementary error function, imaginary error function, and Dawson
 function); given these, one can also easily compute Voigt functions, Fresnel
 integrals, and similar related functions as well.
 .
 This package contains the development files needed to compile software using
 openspecfun.
