Description: automatic PXE and puppet-master installer for OpenStack - PoC
 OCI (OpenStack Cluster Installer) is a software to provision an OpenStack
 cluster automatically. This package install a provisioning machine, which
 consists of a DHCP server, a PXE boot server, and a puppet-master.
 .
 Once computers in the cluster boot for the first time, a Debian live system
 is served by OCI, to act as a discovery image. This live system then reports
 the hardware features back to OCI. The computers can then be installed with
 Debian from that live system, configured with a puppet-agent that will connect
 to the puppet-master of OCI. OpenStack is then provisionned in these machines.
 .
 All of this is managed through a web interface or through the CLI.
 .
 This package installs a PoC (Proof of Concept) server running VMs to test,
 contribute and debug OCI. Note that you need at least 80 GB of RAM to run it,
 as it will provision 8 nodes, with 2 nodes for each role: controller, computes,
 volume and network, plus the OCI node.
