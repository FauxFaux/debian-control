Description: Metapackage to install an Openstack keystone
 OpenStack is a reliable cloud infrastructure. Its mission is to produce
 the ubiquitous cloud computing platform that will meet the needs of public
 and private cloud providers regardless of size, by being simple to implement
 and massively scalable.
 .
 This metapackage will install keystone, and is needed because of the orders
 in which things should be configured to install all of openstack at once.
