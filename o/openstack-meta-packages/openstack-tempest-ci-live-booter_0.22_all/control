Description: configures a server to boot a custom live image to test OpenStack
 The best environment to run OpenStack in order to test it, is a Debian Live
 system, booted over PXE, which we just "reinstall" by performing an (IPMI)
 reboot of the server. However, such setup is complicated, and error-prone.
 This is why this package was designed for: configuring a computer to act as
 PXE/DHCP/apache to boot that 2nd server.
 .
 This package configures the different tools (ie: isc-dhcp-server, tftpd-hpa,
 apache and son on) with a script. Its intention is *not* to be clean, but to
 just do the job of configuring for testing OpenStack. It is *not* to be used
 in production.
 .
 This package also contains the necessary scripts to create the Debian Live
 image using live-build, and the qemu-kvm setup to start a virtual machine
 that will PXE boot using that live image, so it is easy to test the setup
 without actual real hardware.
