Description: validate OpenStack Debian packages using tempest and openstack-deploy
 OpenStack is a reliable cloud infrastructure. Its mission is to produce
 the ubiquitous cloud computing platform that will meet the needs of public
 and private cloud providers regardless of size, by being simple to
 implement and massively scalable.
 .
 This package is to be used to validate OpenStack packages against the tempest
 functional testing suite. It uses openstack-deploy to install a full OpenStack
 deployment on a single virtual machine running itself on an OpenStack cloud,
 using Qemu as hypervisor. Then the Tempest unit tests will be run.
 .
 Typically, this package is to be installed on a Jenkins machine and it's
 script shall be run on regular basis.
