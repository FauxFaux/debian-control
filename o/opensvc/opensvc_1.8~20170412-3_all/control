Description: Tools to drive OpenSVC services
 OpenSVC is a 'service' manager, as in clustered service manager,
 designed for real-world heterogeneous datacenters and large-scale
 operations orchestrator (disaster recovery, for example).
 .
 Services are collections of resources (virtual machine, ip, disk
 groups, filesystems, file synchronizations, and application
 launchers).
 .
 Services can be started, stopped and queried for status,
 providing a consistent command set for wildly different
 service integration types.
 .
 Service configurations, status and logs are pushed to a
 central database coupled to a web front-end (collector).
 .
 Services can be administered using the stand-alone
 GPLv2 software stack deployed on the nodes
 (nodeware), or through the web-front end.
