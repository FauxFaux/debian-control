Description: OpenToken lexical analysis library for Ada: shared library
 OpenToken is a facility for performing token analysis within the Ada language.
 It is designed to provide all the functionality of a traditional lexical
 analyzer generator, such as lex. But due to the magic of inheritance and
 runtime polymorphism it is implemented entirely in Ada as withed-in code. No
 precompilation step is required, and no messy tool-generated source code is
 created.
 .
 This package contains the runtime shared library.
