Description: Python3 front-end of OpenTURNS (aka TUI)
 OpenTURNS is a powerful and generic tool to treat and quantify
 uncertainties in numerical simulations in design, optimization and
 control. It allows both sensitivity and reliability analysis studies:
  * defining the outputs of interest and decision criterion;
  * quantify and model the source of uncertainties;
  * propagate uncertainties and/or analyse sensitivity and
  * rank the sources of uncertainty
 .
 OpenTURNS is a large project with more than 300 C++ classes which
 uses well known and supported software such as R for the statistical
 methods and BLAS/LAPACK for the linear algebra.
 .
 This package provides a textual user interface with Python3 that gives
 access to all the functionalities provided by the OpenTURNS library.
