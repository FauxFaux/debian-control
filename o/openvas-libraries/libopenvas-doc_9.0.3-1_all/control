Description: remote network security auditor - libraries documentation
 The Open Vulnerability Assessment System is a modular security auditing
 tool, used for testing remote systems for vulnerabilities that should be
 fixed.
 .
 It is made up of two parts: a server, and a client. The server/daemon,
 openvasd, is in charge of the attacks, whereas the client,
 OpenVAS-Client, provides an X11/GTK+ user interface.
 .
 This package contains the doxygen generated HTML documentation for the
 libraries.
