Description: architecture independent files for openvas-manager
 The OpenVAS-Manager is a layer between OpenVAS-Scanner and various client
 applications such as OpenVAS-Client or Greenbone Security Assistant.  Among
 other features, it adds server-side storage of scan results and it makes it
 unnecessary for scan clients to keep connection until a scan finishes.

 This package contains the common openvas-manager
 files shared by all architectures.
