Description: Manager Module of OpenVAS
 The OpenVAS-Manager is a layer between OpenVAS-Scanner and various client
 applications such as OpenVAS-Client or Greenbone Security Assistant.  Among
 other features, it adds server-side storage of scan results and it makes it
 unnecessary for scan clients to keep connection until a scan finishes.
