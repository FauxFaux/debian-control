Description: integrates OpenVPN with systemd-resolved
 This is a helper script designed to integrate OpenVPN with the
 systemd-resolved service via DBus instead of trying to override
 /etc/resolv.conf, or manipulate systemd-networkd configuration files.
 .
 Since systemd-229, the systemd-resolved service has an API available via DBus
 which allows directly setting the DNS configuration for a link. This script
 makes use of busctl from systemd to send DBus messages to systemd-resolved to
 update the DNS for the link created by OpenVPN.
