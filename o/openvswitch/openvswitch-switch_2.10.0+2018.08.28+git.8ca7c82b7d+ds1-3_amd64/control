Description: Open vSwitch switch implementations
 Open vSwitch is a production quality, multilayer, software-based,
 Ethernet virtual switch. It is designed to enable massive network
 automation through programmatic extension, while still supporting
 standard management interfaces and protocols (e.g. NetFlow, IPFIX,
 sFlow, SPAN, RSPAN, CLI, LACP, 802.1ag). In addition, it is designed
 to support distribution across multiple physical servers similar to
 VMware's vNetwork distributed vswitch or Cisco's Nexus 1000V.
 .
 openvswitch-switch provides the userspace components and utilities for
 the Open vSwitch kernel-based switch.
