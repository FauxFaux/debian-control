Description: Virtual lens design workshop
 OpticalRayTracer is an application that analyzes systems of
 lenses. It uses optical principles and a virtual optical bench
 to predict the behavior of many kinds of ordinary and exotic lens
 types. OpticalRayTracer includes an advanced, easy-to-use interface
 that allows the user to rearrange the optical configuration by simply
 dragging lenses around using the mouse.
