 CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) is an architecture
 that enables program objects to communicate, sending requests and
 receiving replies, between different applications, regardless of their
 programming language, operating system or network location.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static libraries used for
 developing applications that communicate with each other using the
 ORBit2 implementation of CORBA.
