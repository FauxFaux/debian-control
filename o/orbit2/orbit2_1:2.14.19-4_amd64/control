Description: high-performance CORBA implementation - Object Request Broker
 CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) is an architecture
 that enables program objects to communicate, sending requests and
 receiving replies, between different applications, regardless of their
 programming language, operating system or network location.
 .
 This package contains support programs for the ORBit2 implementation of
 CORBA: the IDL compiler needed to import objects definitions into your
 C programs, and the command-line utilities ior-decode-2 and
 typelib-dump.
