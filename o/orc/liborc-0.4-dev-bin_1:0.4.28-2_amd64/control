Description: Library of Optimized Inner Loops Runtime Compiler (development tools)
 Orc is a library and set of tools for compiling and executing

 is a generic assembly language that represents many of the features
 available in SIMD architectures, including saturated addition and
 subtraction, and many arithmetic operations.
