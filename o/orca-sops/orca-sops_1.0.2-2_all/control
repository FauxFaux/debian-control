Description: simple orca plugin system
 The simple orca plugin system is an interface to enhance Orca with custom
 commands. The simple interface allows the usage of any executable (including
 scripts such as shell scripts) to provide information to the user, while the
 more advanced API allows for modification of all parts of the screen reader by
 accessing its internal state. Plugins are called using a configurable key
 stroke.
 .
 This package comes with two example plugins, one to speak the current clip
 board content and another to announce the current desktop work space.
