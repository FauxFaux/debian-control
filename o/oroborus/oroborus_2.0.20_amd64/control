Description: A lightweight themeable windowmanager for X
 Oroborus is a small and simple window manager which does exactly what
 it says it does, manage windows. There is no fancy doc, clip, wharf, or a
 root menu for that matter. These utilities can be provided by other programs
 such as "deskmenu". Oroborus has support for Gnome and session management,
 or can be run as a stand-alone window manager. This package has also been
 compiled with Xinerama support.
 .
 Oroborus is small, about 72Kb at the time of this package. It has full
 keyboard control and is very themeable.
