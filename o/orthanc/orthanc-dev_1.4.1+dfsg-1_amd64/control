Description: Orthanc development files
 Orthanc aims at providing a simple, yet powerful DICOM server for
 medical imaging. Orthanc can turn any computer running Windows or
 Linux into a Vendor Neutral Archive (in other words, a mini-PACS
 system). Its architecture is lightweight, meaning that no complex
 database administration is required, nor the installation of
 third-party dependencies.
 .
 This package includes the header files to develop C/C++ plugins
 for Orthanc.
