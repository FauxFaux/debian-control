Description: Lightweight, RESTful DICOM server for medical imaging
 Orthanc aims at providing a simple, yet powerful DICOM server for
 medical imaging. Orthanc can turn any computer running Windows or
 Linux into a Vendor Neutral Archive (in other words, a mini-PACS
 system). Its architecture is lightweight, meaning that no complex
 database administration is required, nor the installation of
 third-party dependencies.
 .
 What makes Orthanc unique is the fact that it provides a RESTful
 API. Thanks to this major feature, it is possible to drive Orthanc
 from any computer language. The DICOM tags of the stored medical
 images can be downloaded in the JSON file format. Furthermore,
 standard PNG images can be generated on-the-fly from the DICOM
 instances by Orthanc.
 .
 Orthanc lets its users focus on the content of the DICOM files,
 hiding the complexity of the DICOM format and of the DICOM protocol.
