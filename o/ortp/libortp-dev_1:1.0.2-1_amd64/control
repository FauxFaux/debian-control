Description: Development files for the ortp RTP library
 This library implements RFC 1889 (RTP) and offers an easy to
 use API with high-level and low-level access. It is part of
 Linphone.
 .
 The main features are support for multiple profiles (AV profile
 RFC 1890 being the default one); an optional packet scheduler
 for synchronizing RTP recv and send; blocking or non-blocking
 IO for RTP sessions; multiplexed IO; some of RFC 2833 for
 telephone events over RTP.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
