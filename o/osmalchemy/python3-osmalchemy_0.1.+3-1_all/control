Description: OpenStreetMap to SQLAlchemy bridge
 OSMAlchemy is a bridge between SQLAlchemy and the OpenStreetMap API.
 .
 OSMAlchemy's goal is to provide completely transparent integration of
 the real-world OpenStreetMap data within projects using SQLAlchemy. It
 provides two things:
 .
 1. Model declaratives resembling the structure of the main OpenStreetMap
    database, with some limitations, usable wherever SQLAlchemy is used,
    and
 2. Transparent proxying and data-fetching from OpenStreetMap data.
 .
 The idea is that the model can be queried using SQLAlchemy, and
 OSMAlchemy will either satisfy the query from the database directly or
 fetch data from OpenStreetMap.
 .
 OSMAlchemy can work together with Flask-SQLAlchemy for easy use in Flask
 applications, and it can also be used with pure SQLAlchemy.
