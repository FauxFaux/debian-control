Description: Command line tool for working with OpenStreetMap data
 Osmium Tool is a multipurpose command line tool based on the Osmium library.
 .
 With the Osmium Tool you currently can:
 .
  * Get information about an OSM file
  * Convert OSM files from one format into another (supports all XML and PBF
    formats)
  * Merge and apply change files to an OSM file (with or without history)
  * Extract data from OSM history files for a given point in time or a time
    range
 .
 The Osmium library has extensive support for all types of OSM entities: nodes,
 ways, relations, and changesets. It allows reading from and writing to OSM
 files in XML and PBF formats, including change files and full history files.
 Osmium can store OSM data in memory and on disk in various formats and using
 various indexes. Its easy to use handler interface allows you to quickly write
 data filtering and conversion functions. Osmium can create WKT, WKB, OGR, GEOS
 and GeoJSON geometries for easy conversion into many GIS formats and it can
 assemble multipolygons from ways and relations.
