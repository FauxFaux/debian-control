Description: Osmocom's Media Gateway for 2G and 3G circuit-switched mobile networks
 OsmoMGW, the Osmocom Media Gateway, is a Media Gateway for handling user
 plane (voice) traffic in cellular networks.
 .
 OsmoMGW supports the IETF MGCP (Media Gateway Control Protocol) for
 control from Call Agents, such as those present in OsmoBSC and OsmoMSC.
 .
 At the moment (October 2017), OsmoMGW only implements RTP proxy / RTP
 bridge type endpoints, to each of which two RTP connections can be
 established.
 .
 OsmoMGW is the generalized version of an earlier much more special-purpose
 implementation called osmo-bsc_mgcp.
