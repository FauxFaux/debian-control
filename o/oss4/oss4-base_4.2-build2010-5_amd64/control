Description: Open Sound System - base package
 Open Sound System (OSS) is an attempt in unifying
 the digital audio architecture for UNIX.
 .
 This package contains various utilities for configuring
 and using OSS
 .
 For OSS to work on a system with a given sound card, there must be
 an OSS driver for that card in the kernel. For Linux,
 a custom oss4-modules package can be built from the sources
 in the oss4-source package using the module-assistant utility.
