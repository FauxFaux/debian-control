Description: OSSP uuid ISO-C and C++ - headers and static libraries
 OSSP uuid is an ISO-C and Perl application programming interface (API)
 and corresponding command line interface (CLI) for the generation of
 DCE 1.1 and ISO/IEC 11578:1996 compliant Universally Unique Identifier
 (UUID). It supports DCE 1.1 variant UUIDs of version 1 (time and node
 based), version 3 (name based) and version 4 (random number based).
 .
 UUIDs are 128 bit numbers which are intended to have a high likelihood
 of uniqueness over space and time and are computationally difficult
 to guess. They are globally unique identifiers which can be locally
 generated without contacting a global registration authority. UUIDs
 are intended as unique identifiers for both mass tagging objects
 with an extremely short lifetime and to reliably identifying very
 persistent objects across a network.
 .
 This package contains the development environment for the ossp-uuid library.
