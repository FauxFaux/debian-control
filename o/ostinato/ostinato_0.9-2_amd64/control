Description: Packet/Traffic Generator and Analyzer
 Ostinato is an open-source, cross-platform network packet crafter/traffic
 generator and analyzer with a friendly GUI. Craft and send packets of several
 streams with different protocols at different rates. Ostinato aims to be
 "Wireshark in Reverse" and become complementary to Wireshark.
 .
 Features:
  * Open, edit, replay and save PCAP files
  * Support for the most common standard protocols
    - Ethernet/802.3/LLC SNAP
    - VLAN (with QinQ)
    - ARP, IPv4, IPv6, IP-in-IP IP Tunnelling (6over4, 4over6, 4over4, 6over6)
    - TCP, UDP, ICMPv4, ICMPv6, IGMP, MLD
    - Any text based protocol (HTTP, SIP, RTSP, NNTP etc.)
  * Modify any field of any protocol (some protocols allow changing packet
    fields with every packet at run time e.g. changing IP/MAC addresses)
  * User provided Hex Dump - specify some or all bytes in a packet
  * User defined script to substitute for an unimplemented protocol
    (EXPERIMENTAL)
  * Stack protocols in any arbitrary order
  * Create and configure multiple streams
  * Configure stream rates, bursts, no. of packets
  * Single client can control and configure multiple ports on multiple
    computers generating traffic
  * Exclusive control of a port to prevent the OS from sending stray packets
    provides a controlled testing environment
  * Statistics Window shows real time port receive/transmit statistics and rates
  * Capture packets and view them (needs Wireshark)
  * Framework to add new protocol builders easily
