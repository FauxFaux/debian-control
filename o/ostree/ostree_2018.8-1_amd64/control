Description: content-addressed filesystem for operating system binaries
 libostree provides a library and tools for managing bootable, immutable,
 versioned filesystem trees. It is like git in that it checksums
 individual files and has a content-addressed object store; unlike git,
 it "checks out" the files using hardlinks into an immutable directory
 tree. This can be used to provide atomic upgrades with rollback, history
 and parallel-installation, particularly useful on "fixed purpose"
 systems such as embedded devices.
 .
 This package contains the executables used to manage and create
 filesystem trees. It does not affect the boot process for the system
 on which it is installed.
