Description: wrapper for the OpenStreetMap Overpass API (Python 3)
 overpass is a Python module providing a thin wrapper around the OpenStreetMap
 Overpass API, which is a read-only API that serves up custom selected parts of
 the OSM map data. It acts as a database over the web: the client sends a query
 to the API and gets back the data set that corresponds to the query.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of overpass and its command-line
 tool.
