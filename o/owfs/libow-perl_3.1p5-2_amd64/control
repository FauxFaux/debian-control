Description: Dallas 1-wire support: Perl5 bindings
 The 1-Wire bus is a cheap low-speed bus for devices like weather
 sensors, access control, etc. It can be attached to your system via
 serial, USB, I2C, and other interfaces.
 .
 Perl bindings for the OWFS 1-wire support library have been produced
 with SWIG and allow access to libow functions from perl code.
