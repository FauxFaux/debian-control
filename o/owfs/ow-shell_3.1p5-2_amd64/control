Description: shell utilities to talk to an 1-Wire owserver
 The 1-Wire bus is a cheap low-speed bus for devices like weather
 sensors, access control, etc. It can be attached to your system via
 serial, USB, I2C, and other interfaces.
 .
 This package has several command line programs to talk to an owserver.
 Included programs are :
  * owdir: list 1-wire devices or properties
  * owread: read 1-wire value
  * owget: combines owdir and owread
  * owwrite: set a 1-wire value
  * owexist: check if a 1-wire server is reachable
  * owpresent: check if a 1-wire device is connected
