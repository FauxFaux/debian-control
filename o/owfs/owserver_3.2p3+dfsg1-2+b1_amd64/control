Description: Backend server for 1-Wire control
 The 1-Wire bus is a cheap low-speed bus for devices like weather
 sensors, access control, etc. It can be attached to your system via
 serial, USB, I2C, and other interfaces.
 .
 OWserver arbitrates access to the 1-Wire bus from multiple client processes.
 The physical bus is usually connected to a serial or USB port,
 and other processes connect to owserver over network sockets (tcp port).
 Communication can be local or over a network.
