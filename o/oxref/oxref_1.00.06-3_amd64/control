Description: cross reference utility
 The program oxref writes to the standard output stream a cross reference of
 symbols defined in unstripped object files and/or libraries.
 .
 It demangles C++ symbols and can (probably) be used for a large range of
 languages.
 .
 Oxref does not interpret the object files and libraries itself, but calls
 objdump(1) to do so. The output produced by objdump is then filtered by
 oxref, generating the cross reference listing.
