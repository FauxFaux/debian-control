Description: Oxygen font family
 Desktop/gui font family for integrated use with the KDE desktop.
 .
 The basic concept for Oxygen Font is to design a clear, legible, sans serif
 font which would be rendered with Freetype on Linux-based devices. In addition
 a bold weight, plus regular and bold italics, and a monospace version will be
 made.
