Description: install virtual machine guest OSs with minimal input the user
 Oz is a tool for automatically installing guest OSs with only minimal
 up-front input from the user.
 .
 For each type of guest operating system, Oz supports up to three
 operations: operating system installation (oz-install), operating
 system customization (oz-customize), and ICICLE manifest generation
 (oz-generate-icicle).
 .
 Currently many versions of popular operating systems are supported,
 including Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL/CentOS, Fedora, openSUSE, Mandrake,
 and FreeBSD.  See also virt-install(1) and virt-builder(1) from the
 virtinst and libguestfs-tools packages.
