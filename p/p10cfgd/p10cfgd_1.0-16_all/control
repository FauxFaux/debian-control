Description: Remote configuration daemon for Gracilis Packeten
 The 'p10cfgd' daemon provides support for the 'rmtcfg' command in the
 Gracilis Packeten amateur radio network packet switch.  With this daemon,
 and appropriate entries in the non-volatile configuration memory of a
 Packeten, it is possible to have the switch load commands and information
 at boot time.  Further, this daemon appends a command which sets the date
 and time in the clock on the Packeten.
