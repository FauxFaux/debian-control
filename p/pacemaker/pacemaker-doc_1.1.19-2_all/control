Description: cluster resource manager HTML documentation
 At its core, Pacemaker is a distributed finite state
 machine capable of co-ordinating the startup and recovery of inter-related
 services across a set of machines.
 .
 Pacemaker understands many different resource types (OCF, SYSV, systemd) and
 can accurately model the relationships between them (colocation, ordering).
 .
 It can even use technology such as Docker to automatically isolate the
 resources managed by the cluster.
 .
 This package contains
  * the Pacemaker API documentation generated by Doxygen,
  * the Clusters from Scratch book,
  * the Pacemaker Development book,
  * the Pacemaker Explained book and
  * the Pacemaker Remote book.
