Description: CUDF solver based on pseudo-Boolean constraints
 packup is a solver for the package upgradability problem specified in
 the CUDF format. It repeatedly invokes an optimization pseudo-Boolean
 solver in order to solve the problem. By default minisat+ is used for
 that purpose but a different solver can be used by specifying the
 pertaining command line option.
