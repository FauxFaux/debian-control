Description: Automatic deskew and bounding box determination for scanned page images
 This program determines the skew angle for text, and works with
 black/white images in TIFF or PBM format. To achieve this, it uses
 an original algorithm based on a fast implementation of the Radon
 transform. This program is part of the Page Layout Detection Tools
 project, which aims to automate the layout detection in scanned
 page images.
