Description: Parsing, manipulation and simulation of paje trace files (dev)
 The libpaje library features the implementation of the Paje File
 Reader, Event Decoder and Simulator. It is capable of reading trace
 files in the Paje file format and keeping them in memory. Data is
 accessed through a well-defined and efficient interface. You can use
 this library to built new visualization techniques for trace
 analysis, without handling all the parsing of files and how events
 are simulated to rebuilt the behavior of the traced application that
 is meant to be analyzed.
