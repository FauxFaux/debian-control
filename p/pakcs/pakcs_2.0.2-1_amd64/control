Description: Portland Aachen Kiel Curry Compiler
 PAKCS is an implementation of the multi-paradigm declarative language
 Curry jointly developed by the Portland State University, the Aachen
 University of Technology, and the University of Kiel. Although this is
 not a highly optimized implementation but based on a high-level
 compilation of Curry programs into Prolog programs, it is not a toy
 implementation: PAKCS has been used for a variety of applications so far
 (e.g., graphical programming environments, an object-oriented front-end
 for Curry, partial evaluators, database applications, HTML programming
 with dynamic web pages, prototyping embedded systems). The size of all
 current Curry applications implemented with PAKCS amounts to more than
 150,000 lines (or 8 mbytes) of program code.
