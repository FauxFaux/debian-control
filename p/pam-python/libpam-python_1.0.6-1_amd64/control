Description: Enables PAM modules to be written in Python
 This PAM module runs the Python interpreter, thus allowing PAM
 modules to be written in Python.  As a Python incurs a considerable
 overhead its intended audience is SysAdmins writing one off PAM
 modules.  If you are doing that, you should probably install
 the documentation in libpam-python-doc as well.
