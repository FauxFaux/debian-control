Description: automatic per-user temporary directories
 Many programs use $TMPDIR for storing temporary files.  Not
 all of them are good at securing the permissions of those
 files.  libpam-tmpdir sets $TMPDIR and $TMP for PAM sessions
 and sets the permissions quite tight.  This helps system
 security by having an extra layer of security, making such
 symlink attacks and other /tmp based attacks harder or
 impossible
