Description: utility program to test the PAM facility
 Pamtester is a tiny utility program to test the pluggable authentication
 modules (PAM) facility, which is a de facto standard of unified
 authentication management mechanism in many unices and similar OSes
 including Solaris, HP-UX, *BSD, MacOSX and Linux.
 .
 While specifically designed to help PAM module authors to test their
 modules, that might also be handy for system administrators interested
 in building a centralised authentication system using common standards
 such as NIS, SASL and LDAP.
