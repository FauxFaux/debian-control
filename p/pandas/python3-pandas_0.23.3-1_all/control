Description: data structures for "relational" or "labeled" data - Python 3
 pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive
 data structures designed to make working with "relational" or
 "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental
 high-level building block for doing practical, real world data
 analysis in Python. pandas is well suited for many different kinds of
 data:
 .
  - Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL
    table or Excel spreadsheet
  - Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time
    series data.
  - Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with
    row and column labels
  - Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data
    actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas
    data structure
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version.
