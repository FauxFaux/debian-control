Description: PAPI runtime (shared libraries)
 Performance Application Programming Interface (PAPI) provides the tool
 designer and application engineer with a consistent interface and methodology
 for use of the performance counter hardware found in most major
 microprocessors. PAPI enables software engineers to see, in near real time,
 the relation between software performance and processor events.
 .
 In addition Component PAPI provides access to a collection of components that
 expose performance measurement opportunites across the hardware and software
 stack.
 .
 Accessing performance counters from userspace may require reducing the paranoia
 level in /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid, see README.Debian for details.
 .
 This package provides the shared library.
