Description: parallel command processing using OpenMP
 ParaFly provides a simple mechanism for running a predefined list of unix
 commands in parallel using multithreading. Failed processes are captured and
 reported. Successfully executed processes are noted. If the process is rerun,
 only those previously incompleted or failed processes will be executed.
