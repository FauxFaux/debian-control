Description: parallel and distributed programming toolkit for Python
 Parallel Python module (pp) provides an easy and efficient way to
 create parallel-enabled applications for SMP computers and clusters.
 pp module features cross-platform portability and dynamic load
 balancing. Thus application written with PP will parallelize
 efficiently even on heterogeneous and multi-platform clusters
 (including clusters running other application with variable CPU
 loads).
Python-Version: 2.7
