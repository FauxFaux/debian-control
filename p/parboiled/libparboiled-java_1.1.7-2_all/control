Description: Parser library based on Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs)
 Parboiled is a library providing parsing of arbitrary input text based on
 Parsing expression grammars (PEGs). PEGs are an alternative to context free
 grammars (CFGs) for formally specifying syntax, they make a good replacement
 for regular expressions and generally have quite a few advantages over
 the "traditional" way of building parsers via CFGs.
