Description: cut-down version of paredit for non-lisp buffers
 This Emacs addon extends Paredit to non-lisp buffers by providing a
 new minor mode, `paredit-everywhere-mode'.  This works because many
 major modes provide reasonable sexp-oriented navigation.
 .
 Paredit bindings that do not work well outside of lisp buffers are
 not enabled.
