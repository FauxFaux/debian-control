Description: PARI/GP Computer Algebra System shared library
 PARI/GP is a widely used computer algebra system designed for fast
 computations in number theory (factorizations, algebraic number theory,
 elliptic curves...), but also contains a large number of other useful
 functions to compute with mathematical entities such as matrices,
 polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers etc., and a lot of
 transcendental functions. PARI is also available as a C library to allow
 for faster computations.
 .
 Originally developed by Henri Cohen and his co-workers (University Bordeaux I,
 France), PARI is now under the GPL and maintained by Karim Belabas
 with the help of many volunteer contributors.
 .
 This package contains the shared library built with GNU MP support.
