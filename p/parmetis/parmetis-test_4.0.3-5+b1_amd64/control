Description: Parallel Graph Partitioning and Sparse Matrix Ordering Tests
 ParMetis computes minimal-cut partitions of graphs and meshes in parallel, and
 orders variables for minimal fill when using direct solvers for sparse
 matrices.  It does all this in parallel, and also can efficiently re-partition
 a graph or mesh whose connectivity has changed.
 .
 This package contains programs which test the ParMetis libraries using files
 in the parmetis-doc package's examples directory.
