Description: Documentation System Based on ASCII Text
 Perl script that can be used to produce HTML, XHTML, Latex or DocBook/XML
 from a simple ASCII text source document, with minimum syntax rules.
 .
 The text markup is quite simple and allows us to create documents in
 an easy and fast way.
 .
 The tool is not suitable for complex documents, but can be used to create
 an initial version which can be further developed working on the generated
 LaTeX or DocBook file.
