Description: rapid core genome multi-alignment
 Parsnp was designed to align the core genome of hundreds to thousands of
 bacterial genomes within a few minutes to few hours. Input can be both
 draft assemblies and finished genomes, and output includes variant (SNP)
 calls, core genome phylogeny and multi-alignments. Parsnp leverages
 contextual information provided by multi-alignments surrounding SNP
 sites for filtration/cleaning, in addition to existing tools for
 recombination detection/filtration and phylogenetic reconstruction.
