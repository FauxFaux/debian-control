Description: disk partition manipulator - development files
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy, resize,
 move, and copy disk partitions. This is useful for creating space
 for new operating systems, reorganizing disk usage, and copying data
 to new hard disks.
 .
 This package contains the static library and header files for
 libparted, which are really only of interest to parted developers.
