Description: disk partition manipulator - transitional package
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy, resize,
 move, and copy disk partitions. This is useful for creating space
 for new operating systems, reorganizing disk usage, and copying data
 to new hard disks.
 .
 This is a transitional package to ease the migration to the new
 unversioned libparted-dev package, which should be used in preference.
