Description: backup partitions into a compressed image file
 Partition Image is a partition imaging utility. It has support for the
 following file systems:
  * Ext2/3, the Linux standard
  * ReiserFS, a journalised and powerful file system
  * FAT16/32, DOS and Windows file systems
  * HPFS, IBM OS/2 file system
  * JFS, journalised file system, from IBM, used on AIX
  * XFS, another journalised and efficient file system, from SGI, used on Irix
  * UFS (beta), Unix file system
  * HFS (beta), MacOS File system
  * NTFS (experimental), Windows NT, 2000 and XP
 Only used blocks are copied and stored into an image file.
 The image file can be compressed in the GZIP/BZIP2 formats to save disk space,
 and split into multiple files to be copied onto removable media (ZIP for
 example), burned on a CD-R, etc.
 .
 This makes it possible to save a full Linux/Windows system with a single
 operation. In case of a problem (virus, crash, error, etc.), you just have
 to restore, and after several minutes, your entire system is restored
 (boot, files, etc.), and fully working.
 .
 This is very useful when installing the same software on many machines: just
 install one of them, create an image, and restore the image on all other
 machines.
