Description: Puzzle game about matching 3D model structures
 Pathogen Warrior is a puzzle game about matching 3D model structures with
 a 2D hexagon map. It was one of the entrants to the 4th Ludum Dare 48-hour
 game development competition. The theme of the competition was "Infection".
 In Pathogen Warrior, the player's task is to match rotating 3D pathogen
 structures with a 2D model using a hexagon map. The time to accomplish
 the task is limited, and after successfully completing one pathogen, the
 player is advanced to next level, which has a more challenging pathogen.
