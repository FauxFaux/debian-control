Description: CERNLIB PAW library (Lesstif-dependent part)
 CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for
 use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other
 fields such as the biological sciences.
 .
 This package includes the Lesstif-dependent parts of the library pawlib,
 required by the CERNLIB application Paw++.  Note that in order to compile and
 link programs against this library, you must also install the
 libpawlib-lesstif3-dev package.  The remainder of pawlib is provided in the
 package libpawlib2-gfortran.
 .
 The COMIS portion of pawlib is functional on 64-bit machines only when
 statically linked.
