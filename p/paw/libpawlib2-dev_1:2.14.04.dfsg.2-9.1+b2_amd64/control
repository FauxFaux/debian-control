Description: CERNLIB PAW library - portion without Lesstif (development files)
 CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for
 use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other
 fields such as the biological sciences.
 .
 This package includes a static version of (most of) the library pawlib,
 required by the CERNLIB application PAW.  In addition to the internal workings
 of PAW, pawlib also provides the COMIS FORTRAN interpreter and the SIGMA array
 manipulation language.  The Lesstif-dependent parts of the library are
 provided in the libpawlib-lesstif3-dev package.
 .
 The COMIS portion of this library is functional on 64-bit machines only
 when statically linked.
