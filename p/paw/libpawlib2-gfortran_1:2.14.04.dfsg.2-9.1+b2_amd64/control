Description: CERNLIB PAW library - portion without Lesstif dependencies
 CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for
 use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other
 fields such as the biological sciences.
 .
 This package includes (most of) the library pawlib, required by the CERNLIB
 application PAW.  In addition to the internal workings of PAW, pawlib
 also provides the COMIS FORTRAN interpreter and the SIGMA array
 manipulation language.  The Lesstif-dependent parts of the library are
 provided in the libpawlib-lesstif3-gfortran package.
 .
 Note that in order to compile and link programs against this library, you
 must install the libpawlib2-dev and maybe also the libpawlib-lesstif3-dev
 package(s).
 .
 The COMIS portion of this library is functional on 64-bit machines only
 when statically linked.
