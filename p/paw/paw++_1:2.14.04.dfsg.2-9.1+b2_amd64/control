Description: Physics Analysis Workstation (Lesstif-enhanced version)
 CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for
 use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other
 fields such as the biological sciences.
 .
 This package includes Paw++, an interactive program for use in analysis and
 graphical presentation.  Paw++ is the same program as PAW (in the "paw"
 package), but with a more user-friendly Motif-based GUI, compiled against
 Lesstif in Debian.
 .
 The program is linked statically against the CERN libraries on
 64-bit architectures in order to function properly, as its design is not
 very 64-bit clean.
