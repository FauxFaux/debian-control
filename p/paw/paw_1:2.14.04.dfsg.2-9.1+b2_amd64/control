Description: Physics Analysis Workstation - a graphical analysis program
 CERNLIB is a suite of data analysis tools and libraries created for
 use in physics experiments, but also with applications to other
 fields such as the biological sciences.
 .
 PAW is an interactive program providing interactive graphical presentation
 and statistical and mathematical analysis tools.  It is designed to work
 on objects familiar to physicists such as histograms, event files (Ntuples),
 vectors, etc.
 .
 The program is linked statically against the CERN libraries on 64-bit
 architectures in order to function properly, as its design is not
 very 64-bit clean.
