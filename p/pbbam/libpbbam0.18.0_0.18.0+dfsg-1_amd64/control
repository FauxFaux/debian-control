Description: Pacific Biosciences binary alignment/map (BAM) library
 The BAM format is a binary, compressed, record-oriented container format
 for raw or aligned sequence reads. The associated SAM format is a text
 representation of the same data. The specifications for BAM/SAM are maintained
 by the SAM/BAM Format Specification Working Group.
 .
 PacBio-produced BAM files are fully compatible with the BAM specification,
 but makes use of the extensibility mechanisms of the BAM specification to
 encode PacBio-specific information. The pbbam library provides tools to
 work with these files
