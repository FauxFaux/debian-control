Description: genome assembly upgrading tool
 PBJelly is a highly automated pipeline that aligns long sequencing
 reads (such as PacBio RS reads or long 454 reads in fasta format)
 to high-confidence draft assembles. PBJelly fills or reduces as
 many captured gaps as possible to produce upgraded draft genomes.
 .
 PBJelly is part of the PBSuite.
