Description: generate Postscript calendars without X
 "Pcal" is a program to print PostScript calendars for any month and year.
 By default, it looks for a file in the home directory named "calendar"
 for entries with leading dates matching dates on the calendar, and prints
 any following text under the appropriate day.
