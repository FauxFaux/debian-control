Description: specialized libpcap utilities
 pcaputils includes the following libpcap-based utilities:
  - pcapip: filters an input pcap file based on a file containing IP addresses
  - pcappick: picks specific frames out of a pcap by number
  - pcapuc: prints unique src IPs, dst IPs, or {src, dst} IP pairs witnessed
  - pcapdump: a dedicated packet capture utility similar to dumpcap, but with
    these features:
  * logs packet dump and drop rates
  * can run as a daemon
  * can dynamically reload its configuration without dropping packets
  * can be signalled to immediately rotate its capture output file
  * can partition its output based on time intervals (e.g., start of hour or
    start of day)
  * can strip application data from the trace file (output headers only)
  * can sample the packet stream (e.g., only dump every 1 in 10 or 1 in 100
    packets)
