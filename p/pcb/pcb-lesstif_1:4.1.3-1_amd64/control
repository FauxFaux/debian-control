Description: printed circuit board (pcb) design program - LessTif interface
 PCB is an interactive printed circuit board editor for the X11 window
 system. PCB includes a rats nest feature, design rule checking, and can
 provide industry standard RS-274-X (Gerber), NC drill, and centroid data
 (X-Y data) output for use in the board fabrication and assembly process.
 PCB offers high end features such as an autorouter and trace optimizer
 which can tremendously reduce layout time.
 .
 This package contains the LessTif user-interface for pcb.
