Description: Characterize the bandwidth, latency and loss on network links
 pchar is a reimplementation of the pathchar utility, written by Van
 Jacobson.  Both programs attempt to characterize the bandwidth,
 latency, and loss of links along an end-to-end path through the
 Internet.  pchar works in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
