Description: Performance Co-Pilot graphical client tools library
 The libpcp-gui package contains the runtime environment required by any
 monitoring tool that makes use of the time control services of pmtime(1).
 .
 The Performance Co-Pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
 all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
 client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
 that data.
