Description: Performance Co-Pilot log import Perl module
 The PCP::LogImport Perl module contains the language bindings for
 building Perl applications that import performance data from a file
 or real-time source and create a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive
 suitable for use with the PCP tools.
 .
 The Performance Co-Pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
 all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
 client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
 that data.
