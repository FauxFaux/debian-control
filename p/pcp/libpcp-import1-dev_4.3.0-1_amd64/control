Description: Performance Co-Pilot data import library and headers
 The libpcp-import-dev package contains the library and header files
 needed to build an application that imports performance data from
 a file or real-time source and creates a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
 archive suitable for use with the PCP tools.
 .
 The Performance Co-Pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
 all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
 client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
 that data.
