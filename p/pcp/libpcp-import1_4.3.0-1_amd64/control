Description: Performance Co-Pilot data import library
 The libpcp-import package contains the runtime environment required
 by an application that imports performance data from a file or
 real-time source and creates a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive
 suitable for use with the PCP tools.
 .
 The Performance Co-Pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
 all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
 client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
 that data.
