Description: Performance Co-Pilot historical log summary module
 The PCP::LogSummary module provides a Perl module for using the
 statistical summary data produced by the Performance Co-Pilot
 pmlogsummary utility.  This utility produces various averages,
 minima, maxima, and other calculations based on the performance
 data stored in a PCP archive.  The Perl interface is ideal for
 exporting this data into third-party tools (e.g. spreadsheets).
 .
 The Performance Co-Pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
 all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
 client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
 that data.
