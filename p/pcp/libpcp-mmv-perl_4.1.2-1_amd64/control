Description: Performance Co-Pilot Memory Mapped Value Perl module
 The PCP::MMV module contains the Perl language bindings for
 building scripts instrumented with the Performance Co-Pilot
 (PCP) Memory Mapped Value (MMV) mechanism.
 .
 This mechanism allows arbitrary values to be exported from an
 instrumented script into the PCP infrastructure for monitoring
 and analysis with pmchart, pmie, pmlogger and other PCP tools.
