Description: Performance Co-Pilot Memory Mapped Value library and headers
 The libpcp-mmv-dev package contains the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
 library and header files needed to utilise memory mapped value
 instrumentation into a monitored application.
 .
 The Performance Co-Pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
 all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
 client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
 that data.
