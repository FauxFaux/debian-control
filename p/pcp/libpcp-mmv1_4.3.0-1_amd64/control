Description: Performance Co-Pilot Memory Mapped Value client library
 The libpcp-mmv package contains the runtime environment required by an
 application that utilises Memory Mapped Value instrumentation to export
 runtime instrumentation into the Performance Co-Pilot infrastructure.
 .
 The Performance Co-Pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
 all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
 client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
 that data.
