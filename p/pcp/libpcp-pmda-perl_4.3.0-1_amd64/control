Description: Performance Co-Pilot Domain Agent Perl module
 The PCP::PMDA Perl module contains the language bindings for
 building Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDAs) using Perl.
 Each PMDA exports performance data for one specific domain, for
 example the operating system kernel, Cisco routers, a database,
 an application, etc.
 .
 The Performance Co-Pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
 all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
 client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
 that data.
