Description: Performance Co-Pilot Domain Agent library and headers
 The libpcp-pmda-dev package contains the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
 library and header files needed to develop Performance Metric Domain
 Agents (PMDAs).  Each PMDA exports performance data for one domain;
 for example the operating system kernel, Cisco routers, a database,
 an application, etc.
 .
 The Performance Co-Pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
 all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
 client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
 that data.
