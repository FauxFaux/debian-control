Description: Performance Co-Pilot application tracing library and headers
 The libpcp-trace-dev package contains the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
 library and header files needed to directly instrument an application
 for event and value tracking by the pmdatrace(1) PCP Trace Performance
 Metric Domain Agent.
 .
 The Performance Co-Pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
 all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
 client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
 that data.
