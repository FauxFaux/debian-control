Description: Performance Co-Pilot application tracing library
 The libpcp-trace package contains the runtime environment required by
 an application that is directly instrumented for event and value
 tracking by pmdatrace(3), the Trace Performance Metric Domain Agent.
 .
 The Performance Co-Pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
 all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
 client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
 that data.
