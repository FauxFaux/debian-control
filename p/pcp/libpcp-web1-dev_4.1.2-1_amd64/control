Description: Performance Co-Pilot web tooling
 The libpcp-web-dev package contains the library and header files
 needed to build a PMDA which parses and extracts metric data from
 a JSON file.
 .
 The Performance Co-Pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
 all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
 client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
 that data.
