Description: Performance Co-Pilot library
 The libpcp package contains the runtime environment required by
 programs that make use of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) services.
 .
 The Performance Co-Pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
 all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
 client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
 that data.
