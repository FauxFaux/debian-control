Description: Performance Co-Pilot runtime configuration
 The pcp-conf package contains important runtime configuration
 files required by all programs and libraries that make up the
 Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) toolkit.
 .
 The Performance Co-Pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
 all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
 client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
 that data.
