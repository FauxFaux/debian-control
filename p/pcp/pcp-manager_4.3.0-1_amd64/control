Description: Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) manager daemon
 An optional daemon (pmmgr) that manages a collection of pmlogger and
 pmie daemons, for a set of discovered local and remote hosts running
 the performance metrics collection daemon (pmcd).  It ensures these
 daemons are running when appropriate, and manages their log rotation
 needs (which are particularly complex in the case of pmlogger).
 .
 The base PCP package provides comparable functionality through cron
 scripts which predate this daemon but do still provide effective and
 efficient log management services.
 .
 The pcp-manager package aims to aggressively enable new PCP features
 and as a result may not be suited to all production environments.
