Description: OCaml bindings for PCRE (runtime)
 This OCaml-library interfaces the PCRE (Perl-compatibility
 regular expressions) C library. it can be used for matching
 regular expressions which are written in Perl style.
 .
 Compared with the OCaml standard library "Str" module, this
 library:
  * uses Perl style rather than Emacs one
  * is reentrant and thus thread safe
  * is faster (when compiled to native code is even faster than
    Perl regular expressions)
  * returns data on which you can safely use destructive updates
  * gives more "programming comfort" through a better API
 .
 This package contains only the shared runtime stub libraries.
