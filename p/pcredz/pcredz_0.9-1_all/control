Description: Extracts authentication credentials from network captures
 Pcredz extracts and dumps authentication information from either a
 live network capture or a pcap dump file. It works on the following
 (unencrypted) protocols:
 .
  - POP
  - SMTP
  - IMAP
  - SNMP community string
  - FTP
  - HTTP Basic
  - NTLMv1/v2 (DCE-RPC,SMBv1/2,LDAP, MSSQL, HTTP, etc)
  - Kerberos (AS-REQ Pre-Auth etype 23) hashes.
 .
 It can also optionally, although with far lesser certainty, print
 sniffed strings that appear to be credit card numbers.
