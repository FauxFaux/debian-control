Description: Middleware to access a smart card using PC/SC (daemon side)
 The purpose of PC/SC Lite is to provide a Windows(R) SCard interface
 in a very small form factor for communicating to smart cards and
 smart cards readers.
 .
 The PC/SC daemon is used to dynamically allocate/deallocate reader
 drivers at runtime and manage connections to the readers.
