Description: Pd object to report the size of an array
 This provides a simple object for Pure Data that reports the size of an array
 by name. For historical reasons, it is packaged as a standalone object.  It
 is a very simple object, but has always been distributed by itself.  It is
 packaged alone in keeping with the one-library-per-package style of all other
 pd libraries.
 .
 This is a tiny package that might otherwise be lumped into a 'goodies'
 package, but it is the only tiny one like this, so a 'goodies' package would
 end up being just this single object anyway.
 .
 Since Pd>=0.47, this object can be replaced with the built-in [array size].
