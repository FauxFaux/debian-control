Description: Pd library for the "boids" flocking simulator algorithm
 Boids is a bird flight and animal flock simulator. It is based on the
 same algorithm which was used in Jurassic Park for the herding
 dinosaurs.  Boids takes an integer argument which is the number of
 boids. Each time Boids receives a bang, it calculates and outputs the
 new positions of the boids. The output consists of thew coordiantes
 for each boid, the number and type depending on the mode.
 .
 The flight parameters can be changed with messages. Use the 'dump'
 message to output a list of the current parameter settings.
 .
