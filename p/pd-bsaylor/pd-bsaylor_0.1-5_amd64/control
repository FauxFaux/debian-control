Description: library of FFT-based Pd objects by Ben Saylor
 bsaylor is a library of Pure Data objects by Benjamin Saylor:
 .
 pvoc~: a phase vocoder based on Pd's 09.pvoc.pd example patch. Advantages
 over the abstraction include (reportedly) faster execution, instantaneous
 response to input, and adjustable phase locking. It requires FFTW3.
 .
 susloop~: sample player with various loop methods (ping-pong, ... ) like a
 classic tracker interface.
 .
 svf~: a signal-controlled port of Steve Harris' state variable filter
 LADSPA plugin (http://plugin.org.uk).
 .
 zhzhx~: Turns the input signal into a staticky, distorted mess. Comes with
 tone control
