Description: Pd library for calculating various chaotic attractors
 chaos is a library of Pd objects for calculating various chaotic attractors,
 including: lorenz, rossler, henon, ikeda, attract1, base, base3, dejong,
 gingerbreadman, hopalong, latoocarfian, latoomutalpha, latoomutbeta,
 latoomutgamma, logistic, lotka_volterra, martin, mlogistic, pickover,
 popcorn, quadruptwo, standardmap, strange1, tent, three_d, threeply,
 tinkerbell and unity.
 .
 The package includes 1, 2 and 3 dimensional attractors. There are outlets for
 each dimension, starting from the left, followed by three outlets for
 attractor data (see the help patches for details). The scale of the values
 vary between the different attractors.
 .
 Some of the algorithms were derived from other projects, including Julian
 C. Sprott's attract.java and algorithms by Cliff Pickover.
