 CREB - compl. red. ext. blk.
 .
 CREB is a collection of general purpose externals for Pd by Tom Schouten.
 It includes among other things:
  - frequency and time domain dynamic wavetable synthesis (scanned synthesis
    in the framework of linear and nonlinear state space models)
  - several virtual analog oscillators and filters
  - oscillators based on explicit complex and quaternion mathematics
  - building blocks for the discrete wavelet transform and other spectral
    transform tools, smallband oscillators and formant synthesis
  - several chaotic oscillators
