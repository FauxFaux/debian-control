Description: Pd library for working with patterns and numbers
 cxc is a library of Pd objects for random numbers, number patterns and a
 couple errant system tools.
 .
  * ixprint: print data on console without prefix (needed for ascwave)
  * binshift: binary shift objects (<<,>>)
  * ascseq: ascii-sequencer: input anything, which is output again
            sequentially character by character with a given delay
  * ascwave: print funny ascii constructions on console
  * bfilt: re-output every argumen-th event, useful for modulo-sequencers
  * bfilt2: features internal counter, output just bangs
  * cxc_counter: a clone of the counting object from pd-markex
  * reson: an interpolating reson filter
  * cxc_prepend: prepend stuff with another symbol
  * cxc_split: split incoming string at specified delimiter
  * utime: output seconds since epoch and microsecond fraction
  * random1, random_fl, random_icg, random_tw, dist_normal: PRNG algorithms
  * random1~, random_fl~, random_icg~: signal version of above algorithms
  * ENV: get and set environment variables and certain defines like RAND_MAX
  * proc: get stuff out of the Linux proc directory (so far:
          cpuinfo, loadavg, version, uptime)
  * delta~: emit distance to last sample as signal
  * cx.mean, cx.avgdev, cx.stddev: calculate mean, standard and average
                                   deviation of a signal in an array
