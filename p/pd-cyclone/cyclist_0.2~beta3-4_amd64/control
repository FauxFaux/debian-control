Description: Utility for converting Max/MSP binary patches to text
 cyclist is a command line utility for converting the .mxb binary format for
 Max/MSP patches into the .mxt/.pat text format.  It is part of the Cyclone
 library for Pure Data, which aims to bring some level of compatibility
 between the Max/MSP and Pd environments. Although being itself in the early
 stage of development, it is meant to eventually become part of a much larger
 project, aiming at unification and standardization of computer musician's
 tools.
 .
 In its current form, cyclone is mainly for people using both Max and Pd, and
 thus wanting to develop cross-platform patches. In this respect, cyclone has
 much in common with Thomas Grill's flext, and flext-based externals. While
 flext enables developing new cross-platform classes, cyclone makes existing
 classes cross-platform.
 .
 Cyclone also comes handy, somewhat, in the task of importing Max/MSP patches
 into Pd. Do not expect miracles, though, it is usually not an easy task.
