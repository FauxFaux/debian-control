Description: Pd library of clones of Max/MSP 4.5 objects
 Cyclone is a library of PureData classes, bringing some level of
 compatibility between Max/MSP and Pd environments.  Although being
 itself in the early stage of development, it is meant to eventually
 become part of a much larger project, aiming at unification and
 standardization of computer musician's tools.
 .
 In its current form, cyclone is mainly for people using both Max and
 Pd, and thus wanting to develop cross-platform patches.  In this
 respect, cyclone has much in common with Thomas Grill's flext, and
 flext-based externals.  While flext enables developing new
 cross-platform classes, cyclone makes existing classes cross-platform.
 .
 Cyclone also comes handy, somewhat, in the task of importing Max/MSP
 patches into Pd.  Do not expect miracles, though, it is usually not an
 easy task.
