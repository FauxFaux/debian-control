Description: Pd library of experiments in UNIX, the Pd GUI, and more
 The 'hcs' library is a random grabbag of objects that are experiments that
 sometimes lead to full-fledged libraries.  There are objects for getting UNIX
 file and permissions information (group, gid2group_name, group_name2gid,
 uid2username, username2uid, hostname, stat, uname, setenv), Pd GUI
 manipulation (canvas_name, window_name, sys_gui, tcl_version, ce_path,
 tkconsole, pointer_position, cursor), handling filenames (file_type,
 folder_list, helppath, split_path), and more.
