Description: enable Pd-objects with funny characters
 The default external objects loader of Pure Data (Pd) maps object names to
 filenames and C-function names.
 Unfortunately both filenames and C-function names have restrictions (like the
 impossibility to include a '/').
 .
 This library adds an escaping mechanism based on hexadecimal encoding that
 allows one to write and use objects that would otherwise be impossible.
