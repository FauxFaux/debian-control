Description: Pd-Objects for meta patching
 This library contains a collection of very low-level objects for Pd, that are
 usually used to build higher-level abstractions for dynamic patching and live
 coding by adding reflection capabilities to the patcher language.
 .
 This library is famous for allowing Pd-objects to move around in the patch.
