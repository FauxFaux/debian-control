Description: Pd library for low-level networking (IEM implementation)
 This is a re-implementation of the original pd-net library by Martin Peach,
 focussing on reliability and performance.
 .
 This library adds Pure Data objects that allow one to build a networking
 infrastructure within Pd on OSI-Layer 4 (transport layer).
 The objects use threads to allow for non-blocking network communication within
 an audio-realtime environment.
 .
  - [tcpreceive], [tcpsend]: unidirectional communication over TCP/IP
  - [tcpserver], [tcpclient]: bidirectional communication over TCP/IP
  - [udpreceive], [udpsend]: unidirectional communication over UDP
  - [udpclient]: bidirectional communication over UDP
 .
 Since these objects only send/receive lists of bytes, you will most likely need
 to add some glue to implement higher-level protocols (and transmit meaningful
 data).
