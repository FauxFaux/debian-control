Description: provides support for the libdir library format for Pd
 The 'libdir' loader is a Pure Data loader which supports the libdir
 library format.  The libdir library format aims to be a common
 library format for Pd which works with objects written in any
 language, including Pd. This library format was designed to be easy
 to create, install, and use. It should work when installed into the
 global path (i.e. pd/extra) or when copied locally into a project
 folder. It should work with objects written in any supported language
 (i.e. binaries, .pd, and the various loaders like pdlua and tclpd).
