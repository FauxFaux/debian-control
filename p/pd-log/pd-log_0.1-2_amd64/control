Description: small Pure Data library for logging
 This library adds objects to Pure Data (Pd) that allow one to create printout
 at various verbosity levels.

 The objects can be used as drop-in replacement for the standard
 [print] object, but the printed messages can be filtered and
 have a colourful appearance.
