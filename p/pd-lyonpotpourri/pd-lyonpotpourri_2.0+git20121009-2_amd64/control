Description: potpourri of Pd objects for synthesizing with audio
 This Pd library is a potpourri of objects for working with audio created by
 Eric Lyon.  Here is a listing of all the included objects:
 .
  * adsr~ a simple ADSR envelope that can be click triggered
  * bashfest~ a click driven buffer player with randomized DSP
  * buffet~ provides operations on a stored buffer
  * bvplay~ selective playback from a stored buffer with enveloping and
    increment control
  * channel~ access to a precise address in the signal vector
  * chopper~ munging loop playback from a buffer
  * clean_selector~ like selector~ but crossfades when switching channels
  * click2float~ translates a signal click to a float message
  * clickhold~ sample and hold a click
  * distortion~ lookup function distortion
  * dmach~ pattern based sample accurate drum machine prototype
  * expflam~ converts a click to an exponential flam click pattern
  * flanjah~ simple flanger
  * granola~ granular pitch scaling
  * granulesf~ granular synthesis module reading from a soundfile in a buffer
  * granule~ granular synthesis module reading from a stored waveform in a
    buffer
  * impulse~ converts a bang to a click
  * kbuffer~ low sampling rate buffer to capture gestures
  * killdc~ DC block filter
  * magfreq_analysis~ transforms a time domain signal to a magnitude/frequency
    spectrum
  * markov~ implements a first order Markov chain
  * mask~ a click driven pattern sequencer
  * oscil~ oscillator with flexible waveform specification
  * player~ click driven buffer player that can sustain multiple iterations
  * phasemod~ phase modulated waveform
  * pulser~ pulse wave generated by additive synthesis
  * rtrig~ generates random click triggers
  * samm~ sample accurate multiple metronomes, with click signal articulation
  * sigseq~ signal level numerical sequencer
  * stutter~ a basic buffer stuttering player
  * vdb~ a delay line using an MSP buffer for storage (no vector limit on
    feedback delaytime)
  * vdel~ a delay line with built in feedback and oscillator
  * vdp~ a more efficient pointer version of vd~
  * vd~ a simple, self -contained delay unit
  * waveshape~ a Chebychev function lookup waveshaper
