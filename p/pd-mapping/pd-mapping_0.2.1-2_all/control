Description: Pd library for creatively mapping data
 The Mapping Library for Pd is a library of mapping primitives for mapping
 data to controls. Also included are techniques for conditioning sensor data
 to make it usable in the context of instrument design. It is something like a
 set of unit generators for mapping, plotting out the most basic building
 blocks for creating instrument mappings.
