Description: programmatically modify the audio and MIDI settings from within Pd
 This library adds a programmatic interface to Pd (Pure Data) to query the
 currently available audio and MIDI backends (like alsa, jack,...) and
 interfaces (like built-in soundcard, virtual devices,...), and allows one to
 enable and configure them from within a Pd patch.
