Description: library of Pd objects for composing music
 A library of objects for composing music written by Mark Williamson.
 .
 There are currently five objects:
  * pin~ - randomly delivers the input signal to either the right
           or left outlet with a given probability
  * metroplus - allows complex timing bangs to be delivered
  * prob - generates random events with a given probability
  * monorhythm - basic rhythm pattern building blocks that allows
                 polyrhthms to be generated quickly and easily
  * about - delivers a number that is "about" the same as the input number
