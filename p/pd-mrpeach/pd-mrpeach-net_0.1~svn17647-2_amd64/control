Description: Pd library for low-level networking
 This library adds Pure Data (Pd) objects that allow one to build a networking
 infrastructure within Pd on OSI-Layer 4 (transport layer).
 The objects use threads to allow for non-blocking network communication within
 an audio realtime environment.
  - [tcpreceive], [tcpsend]: unidirectional communication over TCP/IP
  - [tcpserver], [tcpclient]: bidirectional communication over TCP/IP
  - [udpreceive], [udpsend]: unidirectional communication over UDP
  - [udpsndrcv]: bidirectional communication over UDP
  - [udpsend~], [udpreceive~]: transmit uncompressed signals via UDP
 Since these objects only send/receive lists of bytes, you will most likely need
 to add some glue to implement higher-level protocols (and transmit meaningful
 data).
