Description: Open Sound Control for Pd
 This library allows one to construct and parse OSC messages within Pd.  It
 includes support for ordinary OSC-messages, typetags, timetags and bundles.
 .
 These objects are transport-agnostic, so you can use them to transmit OSC over
 UDP, TCP/IP, serial port, or in fact whatever you want.  However, you will have
 to install additional libraries that will handle the transport layer (like
 pd-net or pd-comport).
 .
 Note however, that OSC is a packet-based protocol, so if you intend to use it
 with a stream-based transport (like TCP/IP or the serial line), you must use
 a packetizer (the OSC-specifications suggest to use SLIP, as provided by
 pd-slip).
