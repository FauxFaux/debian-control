Description: Pd library for complex data mappings
 This collection of abstractions for Pure Data (Pd)are made to facilitate the
 use of sensors and to create complex relations between input and output of a
 dynamic system.
 .
 Puremapping is based on the (discontinued) 'la-kitchen' library, and the
 'mapping' library (shipped in Debian as 'pd-mapping').
 Most object of puremapping should be compatible with the 'mapping' library.
