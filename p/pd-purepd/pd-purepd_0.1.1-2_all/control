Description: library of standard objects re-implemented using Pd-vanilla
 This is a library focused on re-implementing existing objects written in C
 using only objects that are included in puredata.  The idea is to provide
 drop-in replacements for the binary objects usable on any platform that are
 also understandable to any Pd programmer.
