Description: Real Time Composition Library for Pure Data (Pd)
 This software library offers the possibility to experiment with a number of
 compositional techniques, such as serial procedures, permutations and
 controlled randomness.
 .
 Most of these objects are geared towards straightforward processing of data.
 By using these specialized objects together in a patch, programming becomes
 much more clear and easy.
 .
 Many functions that are often useful in algorithmic composition are provided
 with this library - therefore the composer could concentrate rather on the
 composition than the programming aspects.
