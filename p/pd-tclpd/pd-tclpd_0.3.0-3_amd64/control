Description: Tcl objects for Pure Data (Pd)
 This library allows one to write externals for Pd using the Tcl language.
 It wraps the Pd API quite closely, and provides a small library of helper
 functions to be used for writing externals.
 .
 Using Tcl for writing objects in Pd has the advantage, the Tcl/Tk is already
 used as Pd's GUI toolkit, so no additional dependencies are required.
