Description: Universal Polyphonic Player for Pure Data
 The Universal Polyphonic Player (short UPP) is an infrastructure for all kinds
 of polyphonic events â€“ be it note-like events, other generated sounds or short
 grains in granular synthesis. The strengths of the system are a modular, easily
 extendible design, almost unlimited polyphony, ease of control, DSP load
 scaling and sample-accurate timing.
