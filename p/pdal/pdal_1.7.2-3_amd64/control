Description: Point Data Abstraction Library
 PDAL is a BSD licensed library for translating and manipulating point
 cloud data of various formats. PDAL can be used to read, write and
 translate point cloud data in many formats. Support is included for
 input files of LAS, LAZ, SBET, BPF, QFIT and others. PDAL can also read
 from and write to databases that support point cloud storage, including
 Oracle, Postgres and SQLite.
 .
 PDAL should not be confused with PCL (Point Cloud Library). PCL is a
 library specifically designed to provide algorithmic analysis and
 modification of point clouds. PDAL provides a limited interface to the
 facilities of PCL, but does not in general attempt to duplicate its
 capabilities.
 .
 This package contains the PDAL utilities.
