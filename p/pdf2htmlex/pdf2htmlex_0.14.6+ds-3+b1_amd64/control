Description: Converts PDF to HTML while retaining most formatting
 pdf2htmlEX converts PDF to HTML while retaining text, format and style as much
 as possible by making use of HTML5, JavaScript and modern CSS features.
 Even difficult content like PDFs with embedded fonts, multicolumn documents,
 scientific papers with complicated figures and mathematical formulas will
 mostly be represented correctly. Fallback mode generates HTML pages which
 do not require any JavaScript to view them correctly at the expense of a
 larger file size.
