Description: PDF files password cracker
 PDFCrack is a simple tool for recovering passwords from pdf-documents.
 .
 It should be able to handle all pdfs that uses the standard security handler
 but the pdf-parsing routines are a bit of a quick hack so you might stumble
 across some pdfs where the parser needs to be fixed to handle.
 .
 The main PDFCrack features are:
 .
   - Supports the standard security handler (revision 2, 3 and 4) on all known
     PDF-versions.
   - Supports cracking both owner and userpasswords.
   - Both wordlists and bruteforcing the password are supported.
   - Simple permutations (currently only trying first character as Upper Case).
   - Save and load a running job.
   - Simple benchmarking.
   - Optimised search for owner-password when user-password is known.
 .
 This program can be used in forensics investigations or similar activities,
 to legal password crack.
