Description: PDF parser and analyser
 PDFMiner is a tool for extracting information from PDF documents, which
 focuses entirely on getting and analyzing text data. It allows one to obtain
 the exact location of text portions in a page, as well as other information
 such as fonts or lines. It includes a PDF converter that can transform PDF
 files into other text formats (such as HTML). It has an extensible PDF parser
 that can be used for other purposes than text analysis.
 .
 This package provides the Python module and the command-line tools: pdf2txt
 and dumppdf.
