Description: scale and tile PDF images/pages to print on multiple pages
 Pdfposter can be used to create a large poster by building it from
 multiple pages and/or printing it on large media. It expects as input a
 PDF file, normally printing on a single page. The output is again a
 PDF file, maybe containing multiple pages together building the
 poster. The input page will be scaled to obtain the desired size.
 .
 This is much like poster does for Postscript files, but working with PDF.
 Since sometimes poster does not like your files converted from PDF. :-)
 Indeed pdfposter was inspired by poster.  For more information please refer
