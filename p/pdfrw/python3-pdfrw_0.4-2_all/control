Description: PDF file manipulation library (Python 3)
 pdfrw can read and write PDF files, and can also be used to read in PDFs which
 can then be used inside reportlab.
 .
 pdfrw tries to be agnostic about the contents of PDF files, and support them
 as containers, but to do useful work, something a little higher-level is
 required. It supports the following:
 .
  * PDF pages. pdfrw knows enough to find the pages in PDF files you read in,
    and to write a set of pages back out to a new PDF file.
  * Form XObjects. pdfrw can take any page or rectangle on a page, and convert
    it to a Form XObject, suitable for use inside another PDF file
  * reportlab objects. pdfrw can recursively create a set of reportlab objects
    from its internal object format. This allows, for example, Form XObjects to
    be used inside reportlab.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
