Description: openGL extensions for PDP
 PDP is an extension library for Pd that allows you to manipulate movies
 and live video data in realtime. PDP stands for Pd Packet, the data
 container that is used for images in PDP.
 .
 This library extends PDP with texture and render context packets,
 to use some of the power of current video hardware.
