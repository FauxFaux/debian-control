Description: Python Environment for Bayesian Learning
 Pebl is a Python library and command line application for learning
 the structure of a Bayesian network given prior knowledge and
 observations. Pebl includes the following features:
   * Can learn with observational and interventional data
   * Handles missing values and hidden variables using exact and heuristic
     methods
   * Provides several learning algorithms; makes creating new ones simple
   * Has facilities for transparent parallel execution using several
     cluster/grid resources
   * Calculates edge marginals and consensus networks
   * Presents results in a variety of formats
