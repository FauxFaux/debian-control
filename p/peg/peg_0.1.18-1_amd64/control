Description: recursive-descent parser generators for C
 This package provides peg and leg, two utilities that read a Parsing
 Expression Grammar (PEG) and generate a recursive-descent parser for
 it.
 .
 Unlike lex and yacc, peg and leg support unlimited backtracking,
 provide ordered choice as a means for disambiguation, and can combine
 scanning (lexical analysis) and parsing (syntactic analysis) into a
 single activity.
