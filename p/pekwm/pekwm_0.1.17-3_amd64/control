Description: very light window manager
 The Pek Window Manager is written by Claes NÃ¤sten,
 the code is based on the aewm++ window manager,
 but it has evolved enough that it no longer resembles aewm++ at all.
 It has a much expanded feature-set, including window grouping
 (similar to ion, pwm, or fluxbox), autoproperties, xinerama,
 keygrabber that supports keychains, and much more.
