Description: command line personal expense manager
 This is a handy tool to help you keep track of your personal income
 and expenses. It is a command line alternative to other personal
 finance and money managers.
 .
 On GNU/Linux and other Unix-like systems, Pem works by storing the
 details in a CSV file placed in the ~/.pem directory under your $HOME
 directory. Each such file is named after the current month, and is
 automatically created by Pem when you enter the first  record for a
 month. It is not advisable to edit these files by hand.
