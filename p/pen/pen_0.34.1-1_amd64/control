Description: Load balancer for "simple" tcp and udp based protocols
 pen works for udp, and tcp based protocols such as dns, http or smtp.
 It allows several servers to appear as one to the outside and automatically
 detects servers that are down and distributes clients among the available
 servers. This gives high availability and scalable performance.
