Description: five in a row game for X and the console
 Pente is the English name for the Asian game ni-nuki, which itself
 is a version of the game go-moku. The game is a variant of the well
 known five in a row. Placing five stones in a row is one way to win,
 the other is to capture five pairs of the opponents stones.
 .
 Pente can run in three different modes: X, curses or text. You can
 play against the computer or another human, and there is also support
 for playing over a network.
