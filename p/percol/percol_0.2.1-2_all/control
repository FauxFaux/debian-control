Description: interactive selection for UNIX pipes
 An interactive grep tool in your terminal. Percol does the following:
 .
 1. receives input lines from stdin or a file,
 2. lists up the input lines,
 3. waits for your input that filter/select the line(s),
 4. and finally outputs the selected line(s) to stdout.
 .
 Since percol just filters the input and output the result to stdout,
 it can be used in command-chains with | in your shell (UNIX
 philosophy!).
