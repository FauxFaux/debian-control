Description: Cross build support for Debian perl configurations
 This package provides the configuration values for selected
 versions of perl. Each set is compatible with the Debian
 configuration of that version of perl, to circumvent the use of
 compiled test binaries which will fail during a cross-build.
 .
 Also provides a helper script to push the relevant configuration
 files into the cross-build using support in debian/rules within
 perl.
