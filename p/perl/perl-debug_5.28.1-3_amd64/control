Description: debug-enabled Perl interpreter
 debugperl provides a debug-enabled version of Perl which can produce
 extensive information about the interpreter as it compiles and executes
 a program (see the -D switch in perlrun(1)).
 .
 Note that this package is primarily of use in debugging *Perl* rather
 than perl programs, which may be traced/debugged using the standard
 perl binary using the -d switch (see perldebug(1)).
 .
 In addition, this package also includes debugging information for the normal
 Perl interpreter.
