Description: Use Perl code in OCaml programs, documentation
 perl4caml allows you to use Perl code within Objective CAML (OCaml),
 thus neatly side-stepping the old problem with OCaml which was that it
 lacked a comprehensive set of libraries. Well now you can use any part
 of CPAN in your OCaml code.
 .
 This package provides developers' documentation and examples about the
 use of perl4caml.
