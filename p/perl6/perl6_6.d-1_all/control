Description: Perl6 Compiler
 Perl 6 is a programming language, member of the Perl family. Like Perl 5, her
 world-famous big sister, Perl 6 intends to carry forward the high ideals of
 the Perl community and is currently being developed by a team of dedicated and
 enthusiastic volunteers.
 .
 perl6 package is a meta package that aims to depend on a Perl6
 compiler and on the Perl6 core modules shipped with rakudo-star.
 These modules will be added once they are available on Debian.
 .
 Perl6 version number represents the version of the language specification.
 The version of the compiler is another matter.
