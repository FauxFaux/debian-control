Description: Perlbal libraries; embed perlbal into another app
 These are libraries that allow an application to internally run an instance
 of perlbal.
 .
 Perlbal is a single-threaded event-based server supporting HTTP load
 balancing, web serving, and a mix of the two. Perlbal can act as either a web
 server or a reverse proxy.
 .
 One of the defining things about Perlbal is that almost everything can be
 configured or reconfigured on the fly without needing to restart the software.
 A basic configuration file containing a management port enables you to easily
 perform operations on a running instance of Perlbal.
 .
 Perlbal can also be extended by means of per-service (and global) plugins that
 can override many parts of request handling and behavior.
