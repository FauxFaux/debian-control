Description: small program that lets you evaluate Perl code interactively
 Perl Console is a light program that lets you evaluate Perl code
 interactively. It uses Readline for grabing input and provides completion
 with all the namespaces loaded during your session.
 .
 This is pretty useful for Perl developers that write modules.
 You can load a module in your session and test a function exported by the
 module.
