Description: Debugging libraries for PETSc
 PETSc is the "Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation", a suite
 of data structures and routines for the scalable (parallel) solution of
 scientific applications modeled by partial differential equations.  It employs
 the MPI standard for all message-passing communication.  Several sample
 scientific applications, as well as various papers and talks, demonstrate the
 features of the PETSc libraries.
 .
 This package provides the development files and debugging libraries for
 debugging applications using PETSc 3.9 with complex number support.
 .
 Libraries include unstripped symbols, but this package is also built with
 internal PETSc debugging activated.
