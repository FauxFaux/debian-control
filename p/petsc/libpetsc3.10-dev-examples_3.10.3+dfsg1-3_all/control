Description: Static libraries, shared links, header files for PETSc
 PETSc is the "Portable Extensible Toolkit for Scientific
 Computation", a suite of data structures and routines for the
 scalable (parallel) solution of scientific applications modeled by
 partial differential equations.  It employs the MPI standard for all
 message-passing communication.  Several sample scientific
 applications, as well as various papers and talks, demonstrate the
 features of the PETSc libraries.
 .
 This package provides example, test, and tutorial scripts for PETSc 3.10.
