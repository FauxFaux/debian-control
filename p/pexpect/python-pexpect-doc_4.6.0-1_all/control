Description: Python module for automating interactive applications (documentation)
 Pexpect is a pure Python module for spawning child applications;
 controlling them; and responding to expected patterns in their
 output. Pexpect works like Don Libes' Expect. Pexpect allows your
 script to spawn a child application and control it as if a human were
 typing commands.
 .
 This is the common documentation package.
