Description: Python 3 module for automating interactive applications
 Pexpect is a pure Python 3 module for spawning child applications;
 controlling them; and responding to expected patterns in their
 output. Pexpect works like Don Libes' Expect. Pexpect allows your
 script to spawn a child application and control it as if a human were
 typing commands.
