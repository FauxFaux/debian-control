Description: PostgreSQL graphical client using Tcl/Tk
 Postgres Forms (pfm) is a client application with a graphical user
 interface for the PostgreSQL data base server. It enables the user:
 to design forms for adding, modifying or deleting records of data
 base tables;
 .
   - to design links (one to many relationships) from one form
     to another, for navigating in the data base;
 .
   - to design and to generate reports based on the data in a
     table or view;
 .
   - to edit and to execute SQL statements.
 .
 Postgres Forms is implemented in Tcl/Tk, but there is no need for the
 user to program anything in Tcl/Tk. The user only has to use SQL for
 creating tables and views and for designing forms, links and reports.
 .
 Postgres Forms makes no attempt to hide the underlying SQL. On the
 contrary, in most cases, it shows both the SQL statements it sends to
 the PostgreSQL server and the results it gets back.
 .
 The PostgreSQL server can be remote or local.
