Description: set of tone mapping operators
 This package contains a set of state-of-the-art tone mapping operators. Tone
 mapping is a technique used to approximately map the appearance of
 high-dynamic range (HDR) images to media with more limited dynamic range. The
 operators are suitable for processing of both static images and animations.
 .
 The operators are embedded in a flexible framework (pfstools) which provides
 a unified input/output mechanism and a modular architecture for the filtering
 of the image data. Various file formats for static images and video are
 transparently supported and the High Dynamic Range data are processed
 modularly through a Unix piping mechanism.
