Description: Realtime PostgreSQL database server monitoring tool
 PgActivity is a curses-based realtime utility to display information from a
 running PostgreSQL database server.
 .
 It is modelled after the standard 'top' utility, and displays information such
 as:
   - the running, waiting and blocking queries
   - cpu, memory and i/o usage of each query
   - the queries execution time
 .
 It also provides interactive commands to sort, filter, scroll and extend the
 queries list displayed.
