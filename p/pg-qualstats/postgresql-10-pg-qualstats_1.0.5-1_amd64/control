Description: PostgreSQL extension to gather statistics about predicates.
 This extensions tracks WHERE clauses predicates and JOIN predicates.
 Statistics will report whether the predicate was evaluated as an index scan or
 not, how many time the expression appeared, how many times the operator was
 executed and how filtering the expression is.  If pg_stat_statements is
 enabled, it can also track to which statements the predicate belongs.
