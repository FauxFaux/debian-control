Description: PostgreSQL extension to gather per-query kernel statistics.
 Statistics gathered are reads and writes done out of the operating system
 cache, user and system CPU usage, context switches and all the other
 meaningful metrics returned by getrusage(2).  All those counters are
 aggregated per postgres role, database and normalized query identifier.
