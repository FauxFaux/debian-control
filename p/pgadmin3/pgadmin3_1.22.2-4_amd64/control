Description: graphical administration tool for PostgreSQL
 pgAdmin III is a database design and management application for use with
 PostgreSQL. The application can be used to manage PostgreSQL 7.3 and above
 and has been tested with PostgreSQL 10.
 .
 pgAdmin III is designed to answer the needs of all users, from writing
 simple SQL queries to developing complex databases. The graphical
 interface supports all PostgreSQL features and makes administration
 easy. The application also includes a syntax highlighting SQL editor, a
 server-side code editor, an SQL/batch/shell job scheduling agent,
 support for the Slony-I replication engine and much more. Server
 connection may be made using TCP/IP or Unix Domain Sockets (on *nix
 platforms), and may be SSL encrypted for security. No additional
 drivers are required to communicate with the database server.
