Description: PostgreSQL Extension Whitelisting
 This extension implements extension whitelisting, and will actively prevent
 users from installing extensions not in the provided list. Also, this
 extension implements a form of sudo facility in that the whitelisted
 extensions will get installed as if superuser. Privileges are dropped before
 handing the control back to the user.
