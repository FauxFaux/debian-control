Description: set of PostgreSQL functions to manage blocks in memory
 Those functions let you know which and how many disk block from a relation
 are in the page cache of the operating system, and eventually write the
 result to a file. Then using this file, it is possible to restore the page
 cache state for each block of the relation.
