Description: Portable Game Notation (PGN) extractor
 Pgn-extract is a program to extract selected games from a collection of
 chess games in PGN format. There are several ways to specify the criteria
 on which to extract: textual move sequences, the position reached after a
 sequence of moves, information in the tag fields, and material balance in
 the ending.
