Description: Shared library for Arcanist and Phabricator
 libphutil (pronounced as "lib-futile", like the English word futile)
 is principally the shared library for Arcanist and Phabricator,
 but is suitable for inclusion in other projects.
 In particular, some of the classes provided in this library improve the state
 of common operations in PHP, like executing system commands.
