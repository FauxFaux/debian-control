Description: PHP front-end to manage virtual services on LDAP - main package
 Phamm is a useful PHP front-end providing role-based administrative
 access to virtual services using an LDAP back-end.
 .
 If you are looking for a Postfix LDAP Front-end Phamm could be a good solution.
 Other MTA's can be used like qmail-ldap, Courier, Exim and Dovecot.
 .
 Phamm works with a plug-in system: the typical service is a mail
 server with virtual mail domain support, but plug-ins are also
 available for FTP, web proxying, and so on. The use of XML descriptor
 files simplifies creating new plugins or customizing existing ones.
