Description: simple to use Photo Batch Processor - developer documentation
 Phatch handles all popular image formats and can duplicate (sub)folder
 hierarchies. It can batch resize, rotate, apply perspective, shadows, rounded
 corners, ... and more in minutes instead of hours or days if you do it
 manually. Phatch allows you to use EXIF and IPTC tags for renaming and data
 stamping.
