Description: PHP5 project build system based on Apache Ant
 PHing Is Not GNU make; it's a project build system based on Apache Ant.
 You can do anything with it that you could do with a traditional build system
 like GNU make, and its use of
 simple XML build files and extensible PHP "task" classes make it an
 easy-to-use and highly flexible build framework.
 Features include file transformations (e.g. token replacement, XSLT
 transformation, Smarty template transformations,
 etc.), file system operations, interactive build support, SQL execution, and
 much more.
 .
 Phing provides the following features:
  * Simple XML buildfiles
  * Rich set of provided tasks
  * Easily extendable via PHP classes
