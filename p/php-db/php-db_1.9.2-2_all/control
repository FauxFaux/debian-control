Description: Database Abstraction Layer
 DB is a database abstraction layer providing:
  * an OO-style query API
  * portability features that make programs written for one DBMS work with
 other DBMS's
  * a DSN (data source name) format for specifying database servers
  * prepare/execute (bind) emulation for databases that don't support it
 natively
  * a result object for each query response
  * portable error codes
  * sequence emulation
  * sequential and non-sequential row fetching as well as bulk fetching
  * formats fetched rows as associative arrays, ordered arrays or objects
  * row limit support
  * transactions support
  * table information interface
  * DocBook and phpDocumentor API documentation
 .
 DB layers itself on top of PHP's existing
 database extensions.
 .
 Drivers for the following extensions pass
 the complete test suite and provide
 interchangeability when all of DB's
 portability options are enabled:
 .
 fbsql, ibase, informix, msql, mssql,
 mysql, mysqli, oci8, odbc, pgsql,
 sqlite and sybase.
 .
 There is also a driver for the dbase
 extension, but it can't be used
 interchangeably because dbase doesn't
 support many standard DBMS features.
 .
 DB is compatible with PHP 5 and PHP 7.
