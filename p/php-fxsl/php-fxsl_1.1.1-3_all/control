Description: XSL wrapper and extension to XSLTProcessor
 An XSL wrapper / extension to the PHP 5.x XSLTProcessor with Exception and
 extended Callback support.
 .
 The fXSL classes extend the standard XSLTProcessor to use exceptions at
 all occasions of errors instead of PHP warnings, notices, or semi
 completed transformations. They also add various custom methods and
 shortcuts for convenience and to allow a nicer API to implement
 callbacks to the PHP stack.
