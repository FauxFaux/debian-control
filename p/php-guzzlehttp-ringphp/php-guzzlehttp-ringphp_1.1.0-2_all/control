Description: Ring adapter and handler system for Guzzle
 RingPHP provides low level APIs used to power HTTP clients and servers through
 a simple, PHP callable that accepts a request hash and returns a future
 response hash. RingPHP supports both synchronous and asynchronous workflows by
 utilizing both futures and promises.
 .
 RingPHP is inspired by Clojure's Ring, but has been modified to accommodate
 clients and servers for both blocking and non-blocking requests.
