Description: object-oriented PHP HTTP client
 Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client library.
 It takes the pain out of sending HTTP requests and the redundancy out of
 creating web service clients. It's a framework that includes the tools needed
 to create a robust web service client, including: Service descriptions for
 defining the inputs and outputs of an API, resource iterators for traversing
 paginated resources, batching for sending a large number of requests as
 efficiently as possible.
