Description: Image_Text - Advanced text maipulations in images
 .
 .
 Image_Text provides a comfortable interface to
 text manipulations in GD images. Beside common
 Freetype2 functionality it offers to handle
 texts in a graphic- or office-tool like way.
 For example it allows alignment of texts inside
 a text box, rotation (around the top left
 corner of a text box or it's center point) and
 the automatic measurizement of the optimal font
 size for a given text box.
