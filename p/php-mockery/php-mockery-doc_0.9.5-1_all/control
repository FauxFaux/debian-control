Description: mock object framework for PHPUnit - documentation
 This package provides the documentation for php-opencloud.
 .
 Mockery is a simple yet flexible PHP mock object framework for use in unit
 testing with PHPUnit, PHPSpec or any other testing framework. Its core goal is
 to offer a test double framework with a succinct API capable of clearly
 defining all possible object operations and interactions using a human
 readable Domain Specific Language (DSL). Designed as a drop in alternative to
 PHPUnit's phpunit-mock-objects library, Mockery is easy to integrate with
 PHPUnit and can operate alongside phpunit-mock-objects without the World
 ending.
