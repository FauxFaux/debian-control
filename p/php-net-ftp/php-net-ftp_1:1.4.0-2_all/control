Description: Net_FTP provides an OO interface to the PHP FTP functions plus some additions
 Net_FTP allows you to communicate with FTP servers in a more comfortable way
 than the native FTP functions of PHP do. The class implements everything
 natively
 supported by PHP and additionally features like recursive up- and downloading,
 dircreation and chmodding. It also implements an observer pattern to allow
 for example the view of a progress bar.
