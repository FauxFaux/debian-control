Description: Object oriented interface for searching and manipulating LDAP-entries
 Net_LDAP2 is the successor of Net_LDAP which is a clone of Perls Net::LDAP
 object interface to directory servers. It does contain most of Net::LDAPs
 features but has some own too.
 With Net_LDAP2 you have:
  * A simple object-oriented interface to connections, searches entries and
 filters.
  * Support for TLS and LDAP v3.
  * Simple modification, deletion and creation of LDAP entries.
  * Support for schema handling.
 .
 Net_LDAP2 layers itself on top of PHP's existing ldap extensions.
