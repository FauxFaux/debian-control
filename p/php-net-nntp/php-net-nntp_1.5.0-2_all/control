Description: NNTP implementation
 PEAR's package for communication with NNTP/Usenet servers.
 Net_NNTP handles the connection and protocol level commands (RFC977),
 including many commonly implemented non-standard commands (RFC2980).
 Net_NNTP includes an unserfriendly API for intermediate user, who don't want
 to work directly at the command level. However, Net_NNTP does require some
 knowlege about the NNTP protocol (RFC 977), and general knowledge about email
 (RFC(2)822) and MIME (2045-2048), since any handling of both content and
 headers is left up to the user!
 The protocol implementation does not parse the actual article data, but at the
 command level it splits returned data at protocol specified boundaries where
 appropriate.
