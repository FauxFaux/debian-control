Description: object mocking framework - phpspec component
 Prophecy is an opinionated and flexible PHP object mocking framework.
 .
 It was initially created to fulfil phpspec2 needs, but is flexible enough
 to be used inside any testing framework out there with minimal effort.
 .
 phpspec can help write clean and working PHP code using behaviour driven
 development or BDD. BDD is a technique derived from test-first development.
