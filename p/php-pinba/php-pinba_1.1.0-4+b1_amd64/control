Description: Pinba module for PHP
 Pinba is a statistics server for PHP using MySQL as a read-only
 interface.
 .
 It accumulates and processes data sent over UDP by multiple PHP
 processes and displays statistics in a nice human-readable form of
 simple "reports", also providing a read-only interface to the raw
 data to enable generation of more sophisticated reports.
 .
 With the Pinba extension, users can also measure particular parts
 of the code using timers with arbitrary tags.
 .
 This package contains a PHP module with the ability to send
 statistics to a Pinba server.
