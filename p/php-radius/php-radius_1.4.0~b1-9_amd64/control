 This package is based on the libradius of FreeBSD, with some
 modifications and extensions.  This PECL provides full support for
 RADIUS authentication (RFC 2865) and RADIUS accounting (RFC 2866),

 users against the user-database of your OS (for example against
 Windows Active-Directory via IAS).
