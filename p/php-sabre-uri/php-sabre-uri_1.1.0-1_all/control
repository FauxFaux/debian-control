Description: several functions for working with URIs
 sabre/uri is a lightweight library that provides several functions for
 working with URIs, staying true to the rules of RFC3986.
 .
 Partially inspired by Node.js URL library, and created to solve real
 problems in PHP applications. 100% unitested and many tests are based
 on examples from RFC3986.
 .
 The library provides the following functions:
 .
  * resolve to resolve relative urls.
  * normalize to aid in comparing urls.
  * parse, which works like PHP's parse_url.
  * build to do the exact opposite of parse.
  * split to easily get the 'dirname' and 'basename' of a URL without
    all the problems those two functions have.
