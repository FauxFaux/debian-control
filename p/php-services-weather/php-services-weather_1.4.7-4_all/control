Description: This class acts as an interface to various online weather-services
 Services_Weather searches for given locations and retrieves current
 weather data and, dependent on the used service, also forecasts. Up to
 now, GlobalWeather from CapeScience, Weather XML from EJSE (US only),
 a XOAP service from Weather.com and METAR/TAF from NOAA are supported.
 Further services will get included, if they become available, have a
 usable API and are properly documented.
