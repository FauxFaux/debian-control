Description: Symfony polyfill backporting some PHP 5.5+ features to lower PHP versions
 This component provides functions unavailable in releases prior to PHP 5.5:
 .
  * boolval
  * json_last_error_msg
  * array_column
  * hash_pbkdf2
 .
 The password_* functions are not actually provided until the
 php-password-compat package becomes available.
 .
 The Symfony Polyfill project backports features found in the latest PHP
 versions and provides compatibility layers for some extensions and functions.
 It is intended to be used when portability across PHP versions and extensions
 is desired.
 .
 Symfony is a PHP framework, a set of tools and a development methodology.
