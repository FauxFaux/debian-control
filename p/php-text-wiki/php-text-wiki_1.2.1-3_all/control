Description: transform Wiki and BBCode markup into XHTML, LaTeX or plain text markup
 The text transformation is done in 2 steps.
 The chosen parser uses markup rules to tokenize the tags and content.
 Renderers output the tokens and text into the requested format.
 The tokenized form replaces the tags by a protected byte value associated to
 an index in an options table. This form shares up to 50 rules by all parsers
 and renderers.
 The package is intented for versatile transformers as well as converters.
 Text_Wiki is delivered with its own parser, which is used by Yawiki or Horde's
 Wicked and three basic renderers: XHTML , LaTeX and plain text.
 Strong sanitizing of XHTML is default.
 Parsers (* and Renderers) exist for BBCode, Cowiki (*), Dokuwiki (*),
 Mediawiki and Tikiwiki (*).
 It is highly configurable and can be easily extended.
