Description: SAX parser for HTML and other badly formed XML documents
 php-xml-htmlsax3 provides an API very similar to the native
 PHP XML extension (http://www.php.net/xml), allowing handlers
 using one to be easily adapted to the other.
 .
 The key difference is php-xml-htmlsax3 will not break
 on badly formed XML, allowing it to be used for parsing
 HTML documents.
