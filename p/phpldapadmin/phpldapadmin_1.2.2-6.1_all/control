Description: web based interface for administering LDAP servers
 phpLDAPadmin is a web-based LDAP client. It provides easy,
 anywhere-accessible, multi-language administration for your LDAP
 server. Its hierarchical tree-viewer and advanced search functionality
 make it intuitive to browse and administer your LDAP directory. Since it
 is a web application, this LDAP browser works on many platforms, making
 your LDAP server easily manageable from any location.
 Usually, you may access PLA by pointing your browser to
 http://<webserver>/phpldapadmin .
