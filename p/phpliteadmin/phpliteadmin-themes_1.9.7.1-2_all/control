Description: web-based SQLite database admin tool - themes
 phpLiteAdmin is a web-based SQLite database admin tool written in PHP with
 support for SQLite3 and SQLite2 (not in Debian). Following in the spirit of the
 flat-file system used by SQLite, phpLiteAdmin consists of a single source file,
 phpliteadmin.php, that is dropped into a directory on a server and then visited
 in a browser. The available operations, feature set, interface, and user
 experience is comparable to that of phpMyAdmin.
 .
 This package contains styles of themes for phpLiteAdmin.
