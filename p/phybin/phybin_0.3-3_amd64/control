Description: binning/clustering newick trees by topology
 PhyBin is a simple command line tool that classifies a set of Newick
 tree files by their topology. The purpose of it is to take a large set
 of tree files and browse through the most common tree topologies.
 .
 It can do simple binning of identical trees or more complex clustering
 based on an all-to-all Robinson-Foulds distance matrix.
 .
 phybin produces output files that characterize the size and contents of
 each bin or cluster (including generating GraphViz-based visual
 representations of the tree topologies).
