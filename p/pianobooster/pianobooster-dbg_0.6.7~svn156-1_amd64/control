Description: learn the piano just by playing a game - debug
 Piano Booster is a new way to learn the piano just by playing a game.
 It takes elements of the game Guitar Hero but now it uses a real piano
 keyboard and the game has been turned sideways so the notes scroll along
 a musical stave. So instead of pressing buttons on a fake guitar you end
 up learning to play a real musical instrument: the piano.

 This package contains the debugging symbols.
