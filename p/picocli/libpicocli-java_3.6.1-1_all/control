Description: Tiny command line interpreter library for Java applications
 Picocli is a one-file framework for creating Java command line applications
 with almost zero code. It supports a variety of command line syntax styles
 including POSIX, GNU, MS-DOS and more. Picocli generates highly customizable
 usage help messages with ANSI colors and styles. Picocli-based applications
 can have command line TAB completion showing available options, option
 parameters and subcommands, for any level of nested subcommands.
