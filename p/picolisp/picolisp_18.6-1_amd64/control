Description: Lisp interpreter and application server framework
 Pico Lisp can be viewed from two different aspects: As a general
 purpose programming language, and a dedicated application server
 framework.
 .
 As a programming language, Pico Lisp provides a 1-to-1 mapping of a
 clean and powerful Lisp derivate, to a simple and efficient virtual
 machine. It supports persistent objects as a first class data type,
 resulting in a database system of Entity/Relation classes and a
 Prolog-like query language tightly integrated into the system.
 .
 As an application server framework, Pico Lisp provides for database
 management (including multi-user synchronization, DB garbage collection
 journalling and replication), web interface integrated (and generated
 from) the application data model, and an application server.
