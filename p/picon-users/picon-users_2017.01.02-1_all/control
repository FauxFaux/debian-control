Description: Picon (Personal Images) database of individual Internet accounts
  "picons" is short for "personal icons". They're small, constrained
 images used to represent users and domains on the net, organized into
 databases so that the appropriate image for a given e-mail address can
 be found. Besides users and domains, there are picons databases for
 Usenet newsgroups and weather forecasts. The picons are in either
 monochrome XBM format or color XPM and GIF formats.
 .
 These databases have been compiled in hopes of helping make cyberspace
 a more personable place. With them, software and services can be
 developed to identify persons on the net by face (or, at least, by
 institution logo) instead of by a cryptic e-mail address. Software of
 this kind is for example xfaces and exmh.
