Description: Parallel coordinates plotter
 Picviz is a parallel coordinates plotter which enables easy scripting
 from various input (tcpdump, syslog, iptables logs, Apache logs,
 etc..) to visualize your data and discover interesting results
 quickly.
 .
 Its primary goal is to graph data in order to be able to quickly
 analyze problems and find correlations among variables. With security
 analysis in mind, the program has been designed to be very flexible,
 able to graph millions of events.
 .
 The language is designed to be close to the graphviz graph description
