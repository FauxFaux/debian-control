Description: Colored adb logcat that shows entries for specific apps
 An update to Jeff Sharkey's excellent logcat color script which only shows
 log entries for processes from a specific application package.
 .
 During application development you often want to only display log messages
 coming from your app. Unfortunately, because the process ID changes every
 time you deploy to the phone it becomes a challenge to grep for the right
 thing.
 .
 This script solves that problem by filtering by application package. Supply
 the target package as the sole argument to the Python script and enjoy a more
 convenient development process.
