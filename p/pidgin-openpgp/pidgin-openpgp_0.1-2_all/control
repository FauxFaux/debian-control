Description: OpenPGP plugin for Pidgin
 pidgin-openpgp is a plugin for the Pidgin instant messaging
 program which enables it to communicate with Jabber/XMPP peers
 in an encrypted manner using the OpenPGP standard and XEP-0027,
 which is understood by other clients, such as centericq, gajim,
 kopete and mcabber.
 .
 This is an experimental extension and potentially buggy.
