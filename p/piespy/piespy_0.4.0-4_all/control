Description: IRC bot to visualize social networks
 PieSpy is an IRC bot that monitors a set of IRC channels. It uses a
 simple set of heuristics to infer relationships between pairs of users.
 These inferrences allow PieSpy to build a mathematical model of a
 social network for any channel. These social networks can be drawn and
 used to create animations of evolving social networks.
