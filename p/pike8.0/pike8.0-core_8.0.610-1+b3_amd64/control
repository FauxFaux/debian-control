Description: Powerful interpreted programming language
 Pike is an interpreted, object-oriented, dynamic programming language
 with a syntax similar to C. It includes many powerful data types and
 a module system that, for instance, provides image manipulation
 together, with support for graphics formats like SVG, JPG, PNG, GIF,
 XCF and many others, database connectivity, advanced cryptography,
 XML/HTML parsers and others. To learn more about pike, please visit
