Description: transitional package for merging into pike8.0-doc
 The documentation previously split between pike8.0-manual and
 pike8.0-reference has been merged into pike8.0-doc, since most of the
 size consists of images, which were duplicated in both packages.

 This package can be safely removed after completed upgrade.
