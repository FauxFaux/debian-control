Description: Examples for the Python Imaging Library
 The Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds an image object to your
 Python interpreter. You can load image objects from a variety of file
 formats, and apply a rich set of image operations to them.
 .
 This package contains PIL API documentation and some example scripts.
 You may also want to look at the python-pil-doc-html or
 python-pil-doc-pdf packages for the PIL handbook documentation.
