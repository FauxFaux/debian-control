Description: GNOME 3 PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 designed for use with GNOME 3.  It tries to follow the GNOME Human
 Interface Guidelines as much as possible.  If the X Window System is
 not active then an alternative text-mode dialog will be used.  There
 are sibling packages that implement PIN entry dialogs using other
 tool kits.
