Description: minimal dumb-terminal PIN or pass-phrase entry for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry prompt
 that interacts directly with the controlling terminal.  It has
 minimal dependencies, meaning that it is useful for users working
 with dumb terminals or similarly constrained environments.  There are
 sibling packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use curses for
 friendlier text-mode inputs on non-dumb terminals, and other sibling
 packages that provide PIN entry dialogs using an X tool kit.
