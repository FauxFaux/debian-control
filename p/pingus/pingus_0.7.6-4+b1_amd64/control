Description: Free Lemmings(TM) clone
 Pingus is a free clone of the popular Lemmings game.

 Your goal is to guide a horde of penguins through a world full of obstacles
 and penguin traps to safety. Although penguins (unlike lemmings) are rather
 smart, they sometimes lack the necessary overview and now rely on you to
 save them.

 This package contains the main program.
