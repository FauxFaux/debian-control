Description: Free Lemmings(TM) clone
 Pingus is a free clone of the popular Lemmings game.
 .
 Your goal is to guide a horde of penguins through a world full of obstacles
 and penguin traps to safety. Although penguins (unlike lemmings) are rather
 smart, they sometimes lack the necessary overview and now rely on you to
 save them.
 .
 This package contains the main program.
