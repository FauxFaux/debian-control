Description: lightweight HTTP interface library - plugins
 pion is not intended to implement yet another web server, but to
 provide HTTP(S) functionality to new or existing C++ applications. If
 you're looking for a full-featured server application, check out Apache
 or lighttpd. If you're working on a Boost C++ application and would just
 like to use HTTP to provide a simple user interface or interact with
 run-time data, then pion is a clean and simple solution.
 .
 Pion Network Library uses the Boost and asio libraries for multi-threading
 and asynchronous I/O. This allows servers implemented using pion to
 handle many thousands of connections simultaneously with a single physical
 server.
 .
 pion also supports server-side SSL & TLS encryption when built with
 the OpenSSL library (which the Debian package is).
 .
 This package includes the pion plugins.
