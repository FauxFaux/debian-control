Description: cli utility that shows the speed of data moving from input to output
 pipemeter can be inserted in a shell command between two programs
 passing data via pipe, or between a file and a program reading from
 stdin, and show the speed and amount of data that has passed through.
 If reading from a regular file, or passed a size, a progress meter is
 also shown.
 .
 Command line switches allow tuning of block size and display interval.
 Size parameters have support for dd style block size specification.
 .
 Pipemeter is intended to be very lightweight, with no dependencies.
