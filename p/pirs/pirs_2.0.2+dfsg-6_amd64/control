Description: Profile based Illumina pair-end Reads Simulator
 The program pIRS can be used for simulating Illumina PE reads, with a
 series of characters generated by Illumina sequencing platform, such as
 insert size distribution, sequencing error(substitution, insertion,
 deletion), quality score and GC content-coverage bias.
 .
 The insert size follows a normal distribution, so users should set the
 mean value and standard deviation. Usually the standard deviation is set
 as 1/20 of the mean value. The normal distribution by Box-Muller method
 is simulated.
 .
 The program simulates sequencing error, quality score and GC content-
 coverage bias according to the empirical distribution profile. Some
 default profiles counted from lots of real sequencing data are provided.
 .
 To simulate reads from diploid genome, users should simulate the diploid
 genome sequence firstly by setting the ratio of heterozygosis SNP,
 heterozygosis InDel and structure variation.
