Description: Pandora Radio client for the GNOME desktop
 Pithos is a cross-platform desktop client for the personalized web
 radio Pandora, supporting all important features the official Flashâ„¢
 client has.
 .
 Pithos was based on pianobar, a console client for Pandora. In addition
 to sporting a GTK+ GUI, Pithos has feature-parity with pianobar.
 .
 Out of concern for the longevity of Pandora Media Inc., the
 software authors would recommend subscribing to Pandora One.
 .
 Use of this application requires a Pandora account; one can be created
 for free at https://pandora.com.
