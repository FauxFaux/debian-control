Description: non-linear audio/video editor using GStreamer
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 PiTiVi allows users to easily edit audio/video projects based on the
 GStreamer framework.  PiTIVi provides several ways of creating and
 modifying a timeline.  Ranging from a simple synopsis view (a-la
 iMovie) to the full-blown editing view (aka Complex View) which puts
 you in complete control of your editing.
