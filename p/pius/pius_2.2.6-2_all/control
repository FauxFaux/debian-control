Description: Tools to help before and after key-signing parties
 After a key-signing party, pius (the PGP Individual UID Signer) signs each
 uid on a GPG key individually. Each signature is encrypted and mailed to
 the email address associated with that particular uid. As a result of this
 process, the recipient can choose which signatures to import. Also,
 signatures of inactive uids are not delivered. This tool greatly reduces
 time and error when signing keys.
 .
 Other tools herein are useful for organizers: pius-keyring-mgr builds a party
 keyring from a CSV file or by scanning mailboxes, and pius-party-worksheet
 generates a worksheet as a hand out. If someone has not signed your key,
 pius-report can analyze a party keyring and remind them.
 .
 This version supports GPGv2 and uses it by default.
