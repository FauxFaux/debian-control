Description: Coin binding for Python 3
 Pivy is a Coin binding for Python. Coin is a high-level 3D graphics library
 with a C++ API. Coin uses scene-graph data structures to render real-time
 graphics suitable for mostly all kinds of scientific and engineering
 visualization applications.
 Pivy allows:
 .
    * Development of Coin applications and extensions in Python
    * Interactive modification of Coin programs from within the
      Python interpreter at runtime
    * Incorporation of Scripting Nodes into the scene graph which
      are capable of executing Python code and callbacks
    * Use of Coin within PyQt4 applications with the quarter module
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 bindings.
