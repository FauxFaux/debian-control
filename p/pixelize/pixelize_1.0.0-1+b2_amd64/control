Description: Create an image consisting of many small images
 Pixelize is a program that will use many scaled down images to
 try to duplicate, as closely as possible, another image.
 .
 Pixelize works by splitting up the image you want rendered (or
 duplicated) into a grid of small rectangular areas. Each area
 is analyzed, and replaced with an image chosen from a large
 database of images. Pixelize tries to pick images that best
 match each area.
