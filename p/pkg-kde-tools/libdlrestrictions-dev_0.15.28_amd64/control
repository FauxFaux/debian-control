Description: development files for the DLRestrictions library
 This package provides development files needed to build both shared libraries,
 which specify their compatibility restrictions, and applications, which check
 whether those restrictions are satisfied before using those libraries. The
 package also contains a CMake module which simplifies building DLRestricted
 shared libraries with CMake.
