Description: various packaging tools and scripts for KDE Applications
 This package contains a variety of packaging tools and build scripts that may
 be very useful when packaging KDE applications. Even if you are a maintainer
 of a very small KDE application, this package should be worthwhile checking
 out.
 .
 Main highlights:
  - recommended build flags for building packages based on the KDE Platform;
  - cdbs class for building packages based on the KDE Platform (kde.mk);
  - debhelper build system (--buildsystem=kde) and dh addon (--with kde) for
    building packages based on the KDE Platform;
  - dh_sameversiondep for generating a dependency that is versioned the same
    way as a dependency (coming from the same source) of another reference
    package.
  - dh_movelibkdeinit for moving libkdeinit4_*.so libraries to private
    location;
  - dh_sodeps (and sodeps dh addon) for generating so:Depends substvar for -dev
    packages based to which local packages lib*.so symlinks point to;
  - dh_qmlcdeps (and qmlcdeps dh addon) for generating qmlc:Depends substvar
    for packages shipping QML cache files.
  - pkgkde-symbolshelper tool for efficient management of C and C++ symbol
    files;
  - pkgkde-debs2symbols tool for generating symbol files and symbol file
    patches from pre-built binaries in the deb packages;
  - pkgkde-getbuildlogs tool for downloading build logs for the specified
    package (from buildd.debian.org);
  - pkgkde-override-sc-dev-latest tool for overriding Breaks of the
    kde-sc-dev-latest package;
  - pkgkde-vcs tool for performing common tasks when packaging under VCS.
 .
 NOTE: since this package is cumulative, it does not depend on the packages it
 provides helpers for. I.e. you still need to explicitly build depend on
 debhelper or cdbs in your packages.
