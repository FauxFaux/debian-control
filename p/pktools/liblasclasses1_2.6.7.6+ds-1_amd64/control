Description: GDAL add-on tools to perform useful raster processing - liblasClasses
 Pktools is a collection of programs to perform operations, mostly on
 raster geolocated  images. It  heavily relies  on the  Geospatial Data
 Abstraction Library (GDAL) and OGR.  The programs are similar to the
 GDAL tools (gdalinfo, gdal_translate,  gdal_merge, ...) and some of the
 functionalities provided in pktools already exist in the GDAL tools.
 .
 All utilities in pktools use command line options and have a built
 in help, and include more than thirty binaries to edit, change, crop,
 classify, compare, dump, fill, enhance images and many other
 common operations useful in the remote sensing field of image
 analysis.
 .
 This package contains the liblasClasses shared library.
