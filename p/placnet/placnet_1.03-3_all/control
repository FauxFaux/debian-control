Description: Plasmid Constellation Network project
 Placnet is a new tool for plasmid analysis in NGS projects. Placnet is
 optimized to work with Illumina sequences but it also works with 454,
 Iontorrent or any of the actual sequence technologies.
 .
 The input of placnet is a set of contigs and one or more SAM files with
 the mapping of the reads against the contigs. Placnet obtains a set of
 files, easily opened on Cytoscape software or other network tools.
