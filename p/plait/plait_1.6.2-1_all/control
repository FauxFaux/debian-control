Description: command-line jukebox
 Plait (pronounced "play") is a command-line jukebox and music player
 front end. It understands brief, easy to type queries that pick a
 single song, mix queries that combine works from multiple artists,
 stream queries that find Shoutcast radio streams, and everything in
 between.
 .
 A variety of filters are available to pick just the music you want
 to hear. In order to actually play the music it finds, Plait
 automatically hands off a play list to one of the supported
 music players (or you can use it manually with any player that
 supports .m3u playlists).
