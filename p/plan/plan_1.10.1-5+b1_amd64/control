Description: X/Motif day planner
 Plan is a schedule planner based on X/Motif. It displays a month calendar
 similar to xcal, but every day box is large enough to show appointments in
 small print. By pressing on a day box, the appointments for that day can be
 listed and edited. Appointments are entered with the following information
 (everything except the time is optional):
 .
  - the date, time, and length of the appointment,
  - an optional text message to be printed,
  - an optional script to be executed,
  - early-warn and late-warn triggers that precede the alarm time,
  - repetitions: [n-th] weekdays, days-of-the-month, every n days, yearly,
  - optional fast command-line appointment entry,
  - flexible ways to specify holidays and vacations,
  - extensive context help,
  - multiuser capability using the netplan server, provided by the netplan
    package.
