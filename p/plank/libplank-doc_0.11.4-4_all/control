Description: Library to build an elegant, simple, clean dock (documentation)
 Plank is a dock enabling you to start applications and manage your windows.

 Plank is meant to be the simplest dock on the planet. The goal is to
 provide just what a dock needs and absolutely nothing more. It is,
 however, a library which can be extended to create other dock programs
 with more advanced features.
 .
 This package contains the documentation.
