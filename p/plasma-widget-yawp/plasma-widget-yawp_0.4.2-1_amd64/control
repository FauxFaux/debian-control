Description: Yet Another Weather Plasmoid fetches weather forecasts for you
 yaWP is a nice and simple plasmoid for KDE 4.x to show the weather forecast,
 works with different weather sources, you can configure it to show several
 days in advance, to display the current satellite image and it is also
 possible to keep track of multiple cities.
 .
 This package contains the Plasmoid itself and the basic theme for yaWP.
 .
 yaWP can be considered to be the native KDE 4.x replacement for the
 SuperKaramba script "LiquidWeather++".
