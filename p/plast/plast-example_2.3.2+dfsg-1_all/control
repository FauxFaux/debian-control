Description: Parallel Local Sequence Alignment Search Tool (example data)
 PLAST is a fast, accurate and NGS scalable bank-to-bank sequence
 similarity search tool providing significant accelerations of seeds-
 based heuristic comparison methods, such as the Blast suite of
 algorithms.
 .
 Relying on unique software architecture, PLAST takes full advantage of
 recent multi-core personal computers without requiring any additional
 hardware devices.
 .
 This package contains some example data to test plast.
