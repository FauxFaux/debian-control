Description: medical image reconstruction and registration
 Plastimatch is an open source software for deformable image
 registration. It is designed for high-performance volumetric
 registration of medical images, such as X-ray computed tomography (CT),
 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography(PET).
 Software features include:
  * B-spline method for deformable image registration (GPU and multicore
    accelerated), including support for image masking, landmark penalties,
    and regularization
  * Demons method for deformable image registration (GPU accelerated)
  * Multi-atlas segmentation
  * ITK-based algorithms for translation, rigid, affine, multiple demons
    methods, and B-spline registration
  * Pipelined, multi-stage registration framework with seamless conversion
    between most algorithms and transform types
  * Landmark-based deformable registration using thinplate splines for
    global registration
  * Landmark-based deformable registration using radial basis functions
    for local corrections
  * Broad support for 3D image file formats (using ITK), including DICOM,
    Nifti, NRRD, MetaImage, and Analyze
  * Extensive toolchain for radiotherapy research, including support for
    DICOM, DICOM-RT, DICOM SRO, XiO file format, gamma analysis, contour
    manipulation, contour overlap analysis, and vector field analysis
 Plastimatch also features two handy utilities which are not directly
 related to image registration:
  * FDK cone-beam CT reconstruction (GPU and multicore accelerated)
  * Digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) generation (GPU and multicore
    accelerated)
