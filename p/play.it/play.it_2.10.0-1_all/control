Description: Installer for drm-free commercial games
 The ./play.it tool builds .deb and .pkg packages from installers for Windows
 or Linux, mainly those sold by GOG and Humble Bundle. The goal is that a game
 installed via ./play.it is indistinguishable from a game installed via the
 official repositories of your favorite distribution.
 .
 The games are installed globally on multi-user systems, avoiding unnecessary
 duplication. The locations of save games, settings, mods, temporary files and
 backups are standardized with XDG Base Directory support.
 .
 Packaging the games simplifies future updates, uninstalls and handling of any
 necessary dependencies, including integrated obsolete dependencies if specific
 versions are needed.
