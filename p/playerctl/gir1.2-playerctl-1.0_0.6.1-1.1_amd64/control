Description: utility to control media players via MPRIS (gir bindings)
 Playerctl is a command-line utility and library for controlling media players
 that implement the MPRIS D-Bus Interface Specification. Compatible players
 include audacious, cmus, mopidy, mpd, quod libet, rhythmbox, spotify, vlc and
 xmms2.
 .
 Playerctl makes it easy to bind player actions, such as play and pause,
 to media keys. Playerctl also provides an introspectable library accessible
 in many popular scripting languages that allows more detailed control like
 the ability to subscribe to media player events or get metadata such as
 artist and title for the playing track.
 .
 This package can be used by other packages using the GIRepository format to
 generate dynamic bindings.
