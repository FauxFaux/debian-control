Description: Plexus IO Components
 Plexus IO is a set of plexus components, which are designed for use in I/O
 operations. These I/O operations are doing nothing spectacular. For example,
 Apache Commons IO is a much more powerful library in the same area. However,
 the implementation as a plexus component allows reuse in Maven.
 .
 The following component groups are currently available:
  * File Mappers
  * File Selectors
