Description: whole-genome association analysis toolset
 plink expects as input the data from SNP (single
 nucleotide polymorphism) chips of many individuals
 and their phenotypical description of a disease.
 It finds associations of single or pairs of DNA
 variations with a phenotype and can retrieve
 SNP annotation from an online source.
 .
 SNPs can evaluated individually or as pairs for their
 association with the disease phenotypes. The joint
 investigation of copy number variations is supported.
 A variety of statistical tests have been implemented.
 .
 Please note: The executable was renamed to plink1
 because of a name clash.  Please read more about this
 in /usr/share/doc/README.Debian.
