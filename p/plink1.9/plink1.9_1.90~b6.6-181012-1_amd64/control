Description: whole-genome association analysis toolset
 plink expects as input the data from SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)
 chips of many individuals and their phenotypical description of a disease.
 It finds associations of single or pairs of DNA variations with a phenotype
 and can retrieve SNP annotation from an online source.
 .
 SNPs can evaluated individually or as pairs for their association with the
 disease phenotypes. The joint investigation of copy number variations is
 supported. A variety of statistical tests have been implemented.
 .
 plink1.9 is a comprehensive update of plink with new algorithms and new
 methods, faster and less memory consumer than the first plink.
 .
 Please note: The executable was renamed to plink1.9
 because of a name clash.  Please read more about this
 in /usr/share/doc/plink1.9/README.Debian.
