Description: fully automated protein-ligand interaction profiler
 The Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler (PLIP) is a tool to analyze
 and visualize protein-ligand interactions in PDB files.
 .
 Features include:
  * Detection of eight different types of noncovalent interactions
  * Automatic detection of relevant ligands in a PDB file
  * Direct download of PDB structures from wwPDB server if valid
    PDB ID is given
  * Processing of custom PDB files containing protein-ligand complexes
    (e.g. from docking)
  * No need for special preparation of a PDB file, works out of the box
  * Atom-level interaction reports in rST and XML formats for easy parsing
  * Generation of PyMOL session files (.pse) for each pairing, enabling easy
    preparation of images for publications and talks
  * Rendering of preview image for each ligand and its interactions
    with the protein
