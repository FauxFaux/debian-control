Description: Programming exerciser in Java, Python, Scala and others
 The Programmer's Learning Machine (PLM) is a free cross-platform programming
 exerciser. It lets you explore various concepts of programming through
 over 200 interactive exercises, that you can solve in either Java,
 Python or Scala.
 .
 The PLM interface and content is thoughtfully translated to English,
 French and Brazilian; Other translations may be added in the future.
 .
 The following concepts are included in this package:
 .
  - Welcome: teach basics of programming to absolute beginners
  - Maze: classical maze escaping algorithms for intermediate
  - Sort: classical sorting algorithms for intermediate. One
    introduction lesson presents the basics of the sorting algorithms
    while two additional lessons apply them in more recreative settings.
  - Recursion: classical logo algorithms for intermediate
  - Turtle Art: explore a few classical LOGO figures
  - LightBot: little programmer's brain teaser for intermediate and advanced
 .
 Other lessons are planned to explore new concepts, such as the
 backtracking, dynamic programming, object-oriented programming or the
 standard libraries of Python, Scala and Java. Other programming languages
 (such as Ruby or JavaScript) may be added in the future.
