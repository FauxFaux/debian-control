Description: Development files for the ploticus library
 libploticus is not a function or mathematical plotting package like
 gnuplot, nor would it be a good choice for applications where
 mathematical formulas or scientific notations are to be rendered
 as an integral part of the data display.  libploticus is also not
 intended as a "marketing" graphics package.  Its goal is to
 display data crisply without extra decoration and distracting
 "dingbats" that cloud the picture.
