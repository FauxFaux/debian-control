Description: script driven business graphics package
 Ploticus is script-driven, which makes it suitable for automated,
 unattended uses, or for applications that will be run again and again.
 In general, ploticus is good at making graphs like you would see in
 newspapers and news magazines, business publications, journals for
 medical and social sciences, and so on.
 .
 Ploticus is not a function or mathematical plotting package like
 gnuplot, nor would it be a good choice for applications where
 mathematical formulas or scientific notations are to be rendered
 as an integral part of the data display.  Ploticus is also not
 intended as a "marketing" graphics package.  Its goal is to
 display data crisply without extra decoration and distracting
 "dingbats" that cloud the picture.
 .
 Ploticus supports a wide range of output options, including jpeg
 (Joint Photographics Experts Group format), png (Portable Network
 Graphics format), svg (Simple Vector Graphics), bmp (Microsoft BitMaP),
 ps (PostScript), swf (Flash), and X11.
