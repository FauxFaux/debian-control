Description: Time format conversion library (development files)
 The qsastime library is a simple library for handling time format
 conversion. It overcomes the limitations of the POSIX time handling
 routines by allow high precision time variables over a large range
 of ranges of dates and by correctly handling leap seconds. It was
 designed with the needs of scientific data plotting in mind. This
 package provides the necessary files to do development with
 libqsastime.
 .
 The source code for this library is part of the plplot source
 package.
