Description: simple plugin system for Bash programs
 The pluginhook command loops through all plugin directories found in the
 path defined by the environment variable PLUGIN_PATH and passes the same
 arguments to any hook scripts by that name. This means installing a
 plugin is as simple as putting it in your PLUGIN_PATH.
 .
 pluginhook does not only provide a mechanism for arguments broadcasting,
 it also accepts streams and pass them through each plugin.
