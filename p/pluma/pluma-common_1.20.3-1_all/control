Description: official text editor of the MATE desktop environment (common files)
 Pluma is a text editor which supports most standard editor features,
 extending this basic functionality with other features not usually
 found in simple text editors. Pluma is a graphical application which
 supports editing multiple text files in one window (known sometimes as
 tabs or MDI).
 .
 Pluma fully supports international text through its use of the
 Unicode UTF-8 encoding in edited files. Its core feature set includes syntax
 highlighting of source code, auto indentation and printing and print preview
 support.
 .
 Pluma is also extensible through its plugin system, which currently
 includes support for spell checking, comparing files, viewing CVS
 ChangeLogs, and adjusting indentation levels.
 .
 This package contains the architecture independent files.
