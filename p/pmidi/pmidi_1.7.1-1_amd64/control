Description: command line midi player for ALSA
 ALSA is an effort to create a modules sound system for Linux,
 while maintaining full compatibility with OSS/Lite.
 .
 This program works with latest ALSA 1.0 drivers and former 0.9 versions.
 .
 This is a straightforward command line program to play midi files
 through the ALSA sequencer.
 .
 As you can specify the client and port to connect to on the command
 line it is also useful for testing ALSA or clients that need to receive
 sequencer events.
