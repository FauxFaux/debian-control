Description: mount removable devices as normal user
 pmount is a wrapper around the standard mount program which permits normal
 users to mount removable devices without a matching /etc/fstab entry. This
 provides a robust basis for automounting frameworks like GNOME's Utopia
 project and confines the amount of code that runs as root to a minimum.
 .
 If a LUKS capable cryptsetup package is installed, pmount is able to
 transparently mount encrypted volumes.
