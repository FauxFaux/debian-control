Description: Development files for the parallel netCDF library
 PnetCDF is a library providing high-performance parallel I/O while still
 maintaining file-format compatibility with  Unidata's NetCDF,
 specifically the formats of CDF-1 and CDF-2.
 Although NetCDF supports parallel I/O starting from version 4, the files
 must be in HDF5 format. PnetCDF is currently the only choice for carrying
 out parallel I/O on files that are in classic formats (CDF-1 and 2).
 .
 In addition, PnetCDF supports the CDF-5 file format, an extension of CDF-2,
 that supports more data types and allows users to define large dimensions,
 attributes, and variables (>2B elements).
