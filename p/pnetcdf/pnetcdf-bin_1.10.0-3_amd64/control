Description: Programs for reading and writing parallel NetCDF files
 Contains tools for working on netCDF files in parallel.
 .
 PnetCDF provides high-performance parallel I/O while still
 maintaining file-format compatibility with  Unidata's NetCDF,
 specifically the formats of CDF-1 and CDF-2.
 .
 In addition, PnetCDF supports the CDF-5 file format, an extension of CDF-2,
 that supports more data types and allows users to define large dimensions,
 attributes, and variables (>2B elements).
