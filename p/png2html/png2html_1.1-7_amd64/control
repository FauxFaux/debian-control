Description: transforms a PNG image to a web page
 Png2html takes a PNG image and transforms it pixel by pixel to a web page,
 encoding each pixel as an appropriately coloured letter. It is decided which
 letter to encode each pixel as by using a text file supplied by the user. An
 example can be found on the project's homepage.
