Description: optimizes PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files
 Pngcrush is an optimizer for PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files.
 Its main purpose is to reduce the size of the PNG IDAT data stream by trying

 remove unwanted ancillary chunks, or to add certain chunks including gAMA,
 tRNS, and textual chunks.
