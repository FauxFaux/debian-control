Description: development files for the pocl library
 Portable Computing Language is an open source implementation of the OpenCL
 standard which can be easily adapted for new targets. One of the goals of the
 project is improving performance portability of OpenCL programs, avoiding the
 need for target-dependent manual optimizations. A "native" target is included,
 which allows running OpenCL kernels on the host (CPU).
 .
 This package provides the development files for the pocl library. Unless very
 specific needs, this package is useless. This package is only required to link
 directly and explicitly with pocl.
 .
 To develop OpenCL programs (that can be run with pocl), the opencl-dev virtual
 package (provided by ocl-icd-opencl-dev for example) is required, not this one.
