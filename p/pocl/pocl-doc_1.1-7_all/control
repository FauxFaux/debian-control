Description: documentation for the pocl library
 Portable Computing Language is an open source implementation of the OpenCL
 standard which can be easily adapted for new targets. One of the goals of the
 project is improving performance portability of OpenCL programs, avoiding the
 need for target-dependent manual optimizations. A "native" target is included,
 which allows running OpenCL kernels on the host (CPU).
