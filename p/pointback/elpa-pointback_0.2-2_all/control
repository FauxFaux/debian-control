Description: restore window points when returning to buffers
 When you have two windows X and Y showing different sections of the
 same buffer B, then switch to a different buffer in X, and then
 show B in X again, the new point in X will be the same as in Y.
 .
 With pointback-mode (or global-pointback-mode), window points are
 preserved instead, and point will be where it originally was in X for
 B when you return to B.
