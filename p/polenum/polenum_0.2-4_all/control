Description: Extracts the password policy from a Windows system
 polenum is a Python script which uses the Impacket Library from CORE Security
 Technologies to extract the password policy information from a windows machine.
 This allows a non-windows (Linux, Mac OSX, BSD etc..) user to query the
 password policy of a remote windows box without the need to have access to a
 windows machine.
