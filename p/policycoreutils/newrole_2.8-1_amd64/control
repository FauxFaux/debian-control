Description: SELinux core policy utilities (newrole application for RBAC/MLS)
 Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux® kernel and a number
 of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
 mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
 kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
 improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access Control,
 and Multi-level Security.
 .
 RBAC/MLS policy machines require newrole as a way of changing the role or
 level of a logged in user.
 .
 This package contains newrole to switch roles, run_init to run /etc/init.d
 scripts in the proper context.
