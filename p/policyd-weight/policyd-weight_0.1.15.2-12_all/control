Description: Perl policy daemon for the Postfix MTA
 policyd-weight is intended to eliminate forged envelope senders and HELOs
 (i.e. in bogus mails). It allows you to score DNSBLs (RBL/RHSBL), HELO,
 MAIL FROM and client IP addresses before any queuing is done. It allows
 you to REJECT messages which have a score higher than allowed, providing
 improved blocking of spam and virus mails. policyd-weight caches the most
 frequent client/sender combinations (SPAM as well as HAM) to reduce the
 number of DNS queries.
