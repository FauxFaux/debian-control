Description: grammar definitions for PolyGen
 PolyGen is a program for generating random sentences according to a grammar
 definition, that is following custom syntactical and lexical rules.
 .
 Formally, it is an interpreter of a language itself designed to define
 languages, where to interpret means executing a source program in real time
 and eventually outputting its result.
 .
 Here a source program is a grammar definition, the execution consists in the
 exploration of such grammar by selecting a random path and the result is the
 sentence built on the way.
 .
 This package contains various grammar files suited for polygen.
