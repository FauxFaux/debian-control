Description: chess engine protocol adaptor, connects UCI engines to xboard
 Common chess frontends have a winboard/xboard input interface, modern
 chess engines speak the UCI "universal chess interface" protocol. This
 protocol adaptor makes it possible to use standard chess frontends, like
 xboard or scid with UCI speaking engines and play chess against them.
