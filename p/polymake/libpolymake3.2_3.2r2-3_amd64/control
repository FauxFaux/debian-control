Description: Tool for algorithmic discrete geometry -- library package
 Polymake started out as a tool for the algorithmic treatment of convex
 polyhedra. By now it also deals with finite simplicial complexes,
 tight spans of finite metric spaces, polyhedral surfaces, and other
 discrete mathematical objects.
 .
 This package contains shared libraries.
