Description: JavaScript library for image- and vector-tiled maps
 Polymaps is a JavaScript library for making dynamic, interactive maps in
 modern web browsers.
 .
 Polymaps provides speedy display of multi-zoom datasets over maps, and
 supports a variety of visual presentations for tiled vector data, in
 addition to the usual cartography from OpenStreetMap, CloudMade, Bing, and
 other providers of image-based web maps.
 .
 Because Polymaps can load data at a full range of scales, it's ideal for
 showing information from country level on down to states, cities,
 neighborhoods, and individual streets.
 .
 Polymaps also uses SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) to display information:
 for this reason you can use CSS rules to define the design of your data.
