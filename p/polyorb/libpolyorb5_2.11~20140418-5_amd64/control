Description: Multiple-personality middleware for Ada
 PolyORB provides a uniform solution to build distributed applications; relying
 either on industrial-strength middleware standards such as CORBA, the
 Distributed System Annex of Ada 95, distribution programming paradigms such as
 Web Services, Message Oriented Middleware (MOM), or to implement
 application-specific middleware.
 .
 Distributed applications will also require the polyorb-servers package but not
 necessarily on the same machine.
