Description: Multiple-personality middleware for Ada (servers)
 PolyORB provides a uniform solution to build distributed applications; relying
 either on industrial-strength middleware standards such as CORBA, the
 Distributed System Annex of Ada 95, distribution programming paradigms such as
 Web Services, Message Oriented Middleware (MOM), or to implement
 application-specific middleware.
 .
 This package provides various middleware servers needed to run a distributed
 application and tools to interact with these servers.
