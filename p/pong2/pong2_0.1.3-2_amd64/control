Description: Remake of old arcade classic in OpenGL
 Pong2 is an up till now two player (networked) game inspired
 by the classical "Pong" from Amiga, which adds another
 dimension to the playing field. It makes use of features found
 on modern 3d graphics cards, so decent hardware is a requirement.
 .
 It also has multiplayer support! 2 players can play against
 each other via network.
