Description: Package manager/organizer for software installed from source
 Porg (formerly known as paco), is a program to aid management of software
 packages installed from source code.
 .
 After the installation of such packages, one is usually left with having no
 idea of what it was installed and where it all went, making it difficult to
 uninstall the package in the future. Porg was written to solve this problem
 in a quite simple fashion.
 .
 When installing a package from sources, porg wraps the install command
 (e.g. "make install"), and saves installation information into a its own
 flat-file text database.
 .
 This package is a complete replacement for the deprecated 'paco' package.
