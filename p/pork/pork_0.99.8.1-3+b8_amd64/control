Description: Console-based AOL Instant Messenger & IRC client
 pork is an ncurses-based AOL Instant Messenger and IRC client. It uses the
 OSCAR protocol (the one the windows client uses) to access AIM. Pork
 features Perl scripting; an online help system; the ability to
 configure nearly all aspects of the program's look-and-feel; an alias
 system; and a powerful, fully-configurable key binding system. It
 supports being logged in with more than one screen name at the same
 time. The default look-and-feel of the client is modeled after the
 ircII IRC client. Anyone comfortable using ircII (or any clients
 derived from it -- e.g., epic, BitchX, etc.) will feel comfortable
 using pork.
