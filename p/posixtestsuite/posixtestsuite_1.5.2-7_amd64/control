Description: POSIX conformance test suite report log
 The POSIX Test Suite is a free (as in speech) test suite with the goal
 of  performing conformance, functional, and stress testing of the IEEE
 1003.1-2001 System Interfaces specification in a manner that is agnostic
 to any given implementation.
 .
 This package only provides the test suite results in a log file. If you
 want to run the testsuite, use the source package of the same name (e.g.
 apt-get source posixtestsuite).
