Description: PostgreSQL map support for Postfix
 Postfix is Wietse Venema's mail transport agent that started life as an
 alternative to the widely-used Sendmail program.  Postfix attempts to
 be fast, easy to administer, and secure, while at the same time being
 sendmail compatible enough to not upset existing users. Thus, the outside
 has a sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is completely different.
 .
 This provides support for PostgreSQL maps in Postfix. If you plan to use
 PostgreSQL maps with Postfix, you need this.
