Description: Balancing and fallback postfix policy delegation service
 Hapolicy enables high availability, weighted loadbalancing and a fallback
 action for postfix policy delegation services. Invoked via postfix spawn
 it acts as a wrapper that queries other policy servers via tcp connection.
 The order of the service queries can be influenced by assigning a specific
 priority and weight to each service.
