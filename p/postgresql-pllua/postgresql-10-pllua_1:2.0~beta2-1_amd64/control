Description: Lua procedural language for PostgreSQL 10
 PL/Lua is an implementation of Lua as a loadable procedural language for
 PostgreSQL: with PL/Lua you can use PostgreSQL functions and triggers
 written in the Lua programming language.
 .
 It brings the power and simplicity of Lua to PostgreSQL, including:
 small memory footprint, simple syntax, lexical scoping, functions as
 first-class values, and coroutines for non-preemptive threading.
 .
 This package is based on pllua-ng.
