Description: upload photos to Flickr
 Postr is a Flickr  uploading tool for the GNOME desktop, which aims to be
 simple to use but exposing enough of Flickr to be useful.
 .
 It has a simple user interface, and lets you set common attributes for
 your photos: title, description, tags, sets, groups, privacy, licence, etc.
 .
 It is integrated with Nautilus: you can either run postr when you are
 browsing your photos or just drag them from Nautilus to drop them in Postr.
