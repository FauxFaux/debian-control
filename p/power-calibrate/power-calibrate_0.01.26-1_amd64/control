Description: processor power calibration tool
 Power-calibrate calibrates the power consumption of a mobile device that
 has a battery power source or of an modern Intel device has RAPL support.
 It will attempt to calculate the power usage of 1% of CPU utilisation
 (and 1 instruction and 1 cpu cycle if perf is available).
