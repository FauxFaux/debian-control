 There are a number of Powerline ZSH themes available, now. The developers of
 this theme focus on four primary goals:
  - Give users a great out-of-the-box configuration with no additional
    configuration required.
  - Make customization easy for users who do want to tweak their prompt.
  - Provide useful segments that you can enable to make your prompt even more
    effective and helpful. It has prompt segments for everything from unit
    test coverage to your AWS instance.
  - Optimize the code for execution speed as much as possible. A snappy
    terminal is a happy terminal.
  - Powerlevel9k can be used to create both very useful and beautiful
    terminal environments.
 .
 To enable this theme for the current user, run:
   echo 'source  /usr/share/powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k.zsh-theme' >> ~/.zshrc
