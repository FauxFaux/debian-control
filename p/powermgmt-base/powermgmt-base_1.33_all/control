Description: common utils for power management
 This package contains utilities for power management; beside certain
 mostly obsolete scripts, you'd want this package for "on_ac_power"
 which lets you determine whether the system is powered from battery
 or an abundant supply.  It's recommended to use this tool over a
 simple sysfs check, ConditionACPower or other ad-hoc methods which
 notoriously fail to account for unobvious quirks, both old and new.
