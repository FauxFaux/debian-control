Description: feature-full driver for OCaml AST transformers (dev files)
 A driver is an executable created from a set of OCaml AST
 transformers linked together with a command line frontend.
 .
 The aim is to provide a tool that can be used to:
 .
  * easily view the pre-processed version of a file, no need to
    construct a complex command line: `ppx file.ml` will do
  * use a single executable to run several transformations: no need to
    fork many times just for pre-processing
  * improved errors for misspelled/misplaced attributes and extension
    points
 .
 This package contains development files.
