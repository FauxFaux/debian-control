Description: account management daemon for Prayer
 Prayer is yet another Webmail interface.
 .
 It is unusual in that it is a complete, standalone, HTTP server and proxy
 rather a Apache/mod_php plugin. Prayer maintains persistent connections to
 the IMAP server and is written entirely in C. Consequently it is much
 faster than most open source Webmail interfaces and puts very little load
 on either the machines running the Web server or the backend IMAP servers
 (even if traditional Unix format mailfolders are in use).
 .
 This package contains a daemon that can do the following for users:
 .
  * Change passwords
  * Change their full name
  * Manage mail filtering (requires Exim) and forwarding
  * Manage vacation messages and logs
 .
 NOTE: This package is currently not very useful.
