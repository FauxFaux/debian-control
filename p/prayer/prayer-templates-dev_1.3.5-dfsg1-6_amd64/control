Description: tools for compiling Prayer templates
 Prayer is yet another Webmail interface.
 .
 It is unusual in that it is a complete, standalone, HTTP server and proxy
 rather a Apache/mod_php plugin. Prayer maintains persistent connections to
 the IMAP server and is written entirely in C. Consequently it is much
 faster than most open source Webmail interfaces and puts very little load
 on either the machines running the Web server or the backend IMAP servers
 (even if traditional Unix format mailfolders are in use).
 .
 Prayer uses its own macro expansion language for the HTML it
 outputs. This package contains the programs and scripts needed to
 build template libraries, as well as a makefile to facilitate the
 process.
