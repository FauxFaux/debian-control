Description: templates for customizing Prayer Webmail
 Prayer is yet another Webmail interface.
 .
 It is unusual in that it is a complete, standalone, HTTP server and proxy
 rather a Apache/mod_php plugin. Prayer maintains persistent connections to
 the IMAP server and is written entirely in C. Consequently it is much
 faster than most open source Webmail interfaces and puts very little load
 on either the machines running the Web server or the backend IMAP servers
 (even if traditional Unix format mailfolders are in use).
 .
 This package contains, in source form, the templates for the HTML
 that Prayer outputs.
 .
 As all the templates are included with the main prayer package in
 compiled form, you only need to install this package if you need to
 customize one or more pages and you want something to start from.
