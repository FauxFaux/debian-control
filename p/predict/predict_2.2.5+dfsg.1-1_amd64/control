Description: Satellite Tracking Program with Optional Voice Output
 This is a satellite tracking program.  It is probably mostly of interest to
 users of amateur satellites, but includes support for optionally announcing
 azimuth and elevation to help in manual antenna pointing, or optical
 observation of satellites.
 .
 The upstream predict sources include a front-end called 'map', which is
 called predict-map in the Debian package.
 .
 The 'ntp' package is suggested because accurate satellite tracking depends
 on precise knowledge of ground station time and location.
