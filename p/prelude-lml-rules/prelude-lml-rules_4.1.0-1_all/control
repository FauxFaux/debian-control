Description: Security Information and Events Management System [ LML Rules ]
 The Prelude Log Monitoring Lackey (LML) is the host-based sensor program part
 of the Prelude SIEM suite. It can act as a centralized log collector for local
 or remote systems, or as a simple log analyzer (such as swatch). It can run as
 a network server listening on a syslog port or analyze log files. It supports
 logfiles in the BSD syslog format and is able to analyze any logfile by using
 the PCRE library. It can apply logfile-specific analysis through plugins such
 as PAX. It can send an alert to the Prelude Manager when a suspicious log entry
 is detected.
 .
 This package contains all rules (or signatures) for Prelude LML.
