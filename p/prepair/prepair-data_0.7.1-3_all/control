Description: polygon repair tool -- example data
 prepair permits you to easily repair "broken" GIS polygons, and that
 according to the international standards ISO 19107. In brief, given a
 polygon stored in WKT, it automatically repairs it and gives you back
 a valid WKT. Automated repair methods can be considered as interpreting
 ambiguous or ill-defined polygons and giving a coherent and clearly
 defined output.
 .
 This package contains the architecture independent example data.
