Description: portable multi-language file preprocessor
 Preprocess is like a typical C preprocessor, but it extends to multiple
 languages. Languages for which it works include: C++, Python,
 Perl, Tcl, XML, JavaScript, CSS, IDL, TeX, Fortran, PHP, Java, Shell
 scripts (Bash, CSH, etc.) and C#.
 .
 Preprocess is usable both as a command line app and as a Python module.
