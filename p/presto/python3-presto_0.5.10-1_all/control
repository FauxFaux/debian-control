Description: toolkit for processing B and T cell sequences
 pRESTO is a toolkit for processing raw reads from high-throughput
 sequencing of B cell and T cell repertoires.
 .
 Dramatic improvements in high-throughput sequencing technologies now
 enable large-scale characterization of lymphocyte repertoires, defined
 as the collection of trans-membrane antigen-receptor proteins located on
 the surface of B cells and T cells. The REpertoire Sequencing TOolkit
 (pRESTO) is composed of a suite of utilities to handle all stages
 of sequence processing prior to germline segment assignment. pRESTO
 is designed to handle either single reads or paired-end reads. It
 includes features for quality control, primer masking, annotation of
 reads with sequence embedded barcodes, generation of unique molecular
 identifier (UMI) consensus sequences, assembly of paired-end reads and
 identification of duplicate sequences. Numerous options for sequence
 sorting, sampling and conversion operations are also included.
