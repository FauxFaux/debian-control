Description: OpenNI module providing gesture and skeleton tracking
 This package will download the binary PrimeSense NITE modules for OpenNI and
 creates a Debian packages you can install.  These modules provide two types
 of tracking to OpenNI: 'Control By Gesture' and 'Games for All'.  'Control By
 Gesture' is gesture tracking for using arm movements for navigating menus, it
 provides gesture tracking for things like push, click, circle, and
 wave. 'Games for All' is skeleton tracking for getting information on the
 position of all of the joints of the body.  These two tracking modes are the
 most common kinds of tracking used with the Microsoft Kinect camera.
