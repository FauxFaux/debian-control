Description: standalone password candidate generator using the PRINCE algorithm
 Princeprocessor is a password candidate generator and can be thought of
 as an advanced combinator attack. Rather than taking as input two different
 wordlists and then outputting all the possible two word combinations though,
 princeprocessor only has one input wordlist and builds "chains" of combined
 words. These chains can have 1 to N words from the input wordlist
 concatenated together.
 The name PRINCE is used as an acronym and stands for PRobability INfinite
 Chained Elements, which are the building blocks of the algorithm.
