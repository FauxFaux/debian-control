Description: Allow unprivileged apps to bind to a privileged port
 Privbind is a utility that allows running non-root applications, only giving
 them one root privilege - binding to low (<1024) ports. The aim is similar,
 though using a completely different method, to "authbind".
 .
 Privbind is a completely user space solution. It has no SUID executables, and
 has to be started by a root user instead.
 .
 Privbind is useful for cases where there is a need to run an untrusted program
 that needs to bind to a low port, but requires no other root privilege. It is
 also useful if a daemon has no capability to drop privileges itself.
