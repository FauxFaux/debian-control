Description: PROBabilistic CONSistency-based multiple sequence alignment
 Tool for generating multiple alignments of protein sequences. Using a
 combination of probabilistic modeling and consistency-based alignment
 techniques, PROBCONS has achieved the highest accuracies of all alignment
 methods to date. On the BAliBASE benchmark alignment database, alignments
 produced by PROBCONS show statistically significant improvement over current
 programs, containing an average of 7% more correctly aligned columns than
 those of T-Coffee, 11% more correctly aligned columns than those of CLUSTAL W,
 and 14% more correctly aligned columns than those of DIALIGN.
