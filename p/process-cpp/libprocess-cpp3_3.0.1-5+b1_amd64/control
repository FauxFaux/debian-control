Description: C++11 library for handling processes (runtime libraries)
 process-cpp is a simple and straightforward wrapper around process creation
 and control. It helps both with handling child processes and with interacting
 with the current process. Some of its features include:
 .
  - Thread-safe get/set/unset operation on the current process's environment.
  - Throwing and non-throwing overloads of functions when system calls are
    involved.
  - Seamless redirection of input, output and error streams of child processes.
  - Type-safe interaction with the virtual proc filesystem, both for reading &
    writing.
 .
 The library's main purpose is to assist in testing and when a software
 component needs to carry out process creation/control tasks, e.g., a graphical
 shell. To this end, the library is extensively tested and tries to ensure
 fail-safe operation as much as possible.
 .
 This package includes the process-cpp runtime libraries.
