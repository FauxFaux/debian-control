Description: predictor of flexible/rigid protein residues from sequence
 PROFbval can be useful for both protein structure and
 function predictions. For instance, a biologist can locate potentially
 antigenic determinants by identifying the most flexible residues on the
 protein surface. Additionally, a crystallographer can locate residues that
 potentially have high experimental B-values.
 .
 PROFbval takes the following input, further described on profbval(1):
  * a protein sequence in a FASTA file
  * secondary structure and solvent accessibility prediction by prof(1)
  * an HSSP file
 .
 Background: the mobility of a given residue on the protein surface is related
 to its functional role.
 Therefore, identification of extremely rigid or flexible
 residues on the protein surface is helpful for identifying functionally
 important residues in proteins. A common measure of atom mobility in proteins
 is B-value data from x-ray crystallography structures. PROFbval is the first
 tool to predict normalized backbone B-values from amino-acid sequence.
