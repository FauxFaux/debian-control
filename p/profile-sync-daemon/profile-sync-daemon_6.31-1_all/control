Description: Symlink and sync browser profile directories into RAM
 Profile-sync-daemon (psd) is a tiny pseudo-daemon designed
 to manage your browsers profile in tmpfs and periodically
 sync it back to disk.
 .
 This is accomplished by symlinking and the innovative use
 of rsync to maintain a backup and synchronization between
 tmpfs and disk. One of the major design goals of psd is a
 completely transparent user experience.
