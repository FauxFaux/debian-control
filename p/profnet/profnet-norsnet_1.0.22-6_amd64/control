Description: neural network architecture for norsnet
 Profnet is a component of the prediction methods that make up the
 Predict Protein service by the lab of Burkhard Rost. It provides the neural
 network component to a variety of predictors that perform protein feature
 prediction directly from sequence.  This neural network implementation has
 to be compiled for every different network architecture.
 .
 This package contains the neural network architecture for norsnet.
