Description: Versatile, virtual-hosting FTP daemon - SNMP module
 ProFTPD is a powerful modular FTP/SFTP/FTPS server. This File Transfer
 Protocol daemon supports also hidden directories, virtual hosts, and
 per-directory ".ftpaccess" files. It uses a single main configuration
 file, with a syntax similar to Apache.
 .
 Because of the advanced design, anonymous-FTP directories can have
 an arbitrary internal structure (bin, lib, etc, and special files are
 not needed). Advanced features such as multiple password files and
 upload/download ratios are also supported.
 .
 The mod_snmp module implements SNMPv1 and SNMPv2, for monitoring of
 proftpd statistics via SNMP.
