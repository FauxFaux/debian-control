Description: ProFTPD module mod_case
 The mod_case module is designed to help ProFTPD be case-insensitive, for
 those sites that may need it (e.g. those that are migrating from a Windows
 environment or have mounted Windows filesystems).
 .
 mod_case works by performing two checks on the filename used in FTP commands.
 First, mod_case will scan the directory to see if there is already a file
 whose name exactly matches the given filename. If not, mod_case will scan the
 directory again, this time looking for case-insensitive matches.
