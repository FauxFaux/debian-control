Description: ProFTPD module mod_clamav
 Mod_Clamav can be configured to either use Clamd via local unix
 sockets or TCP sockets. This allows one to combine ProFTPd with
 Mod_Clamav and Clamd on a system with local unix sockets for minimal
 administrative overhead and decent security. however, also allows for
 a large scale deployment with many ProFTPd servers utilizing a separate
 Clamd host over TCP for scalability and lower administrative overhead.
