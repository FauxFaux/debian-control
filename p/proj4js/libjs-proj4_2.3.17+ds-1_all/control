Description: JavaScript library to transform point coordinates systems
 Proj4js is a JavaScript library to transform point coordinates from one
 coordinate system to another, including datum transformations.
 .
 This library is a port of both the PROJ.4 and GCTCP C libraries to JavaScript.
 Enabling these transformations in the browser allows geographic data stored in
 different projections to be combined in browser-based web mapping applications.
 .
 Proj4js is a part of the MetaCRS group of projects and uses the same MIT style
 license as PROJ.4.
 .
 This package contains the proj4.js JavaScript library.
