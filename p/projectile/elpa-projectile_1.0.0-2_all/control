Description: project interaction library for Emacs
 This library enhances Emacs with easy project management and
 navigation. The concept of a project is simple: just a folder
 containing a special file.  Currently git, mercurial, darcs and
 bazaar repos are considered projects by default.  So are lein, maven,
 sbt, scons, rebar and bundler projects.  If you want to mark a folder
 manually as a project just create an empty .projectile file in it.
