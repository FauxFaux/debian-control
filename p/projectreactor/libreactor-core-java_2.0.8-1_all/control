Description: Reactive Streams Specification Implementation
 Reactor is a foundational library building for reactive fast data applications
 on the JVM. It provides abstractions for Java, Groovy and other JVM languages
 to make building event and data-driven applications easier. Various dispatchers
 are available to provide the developer with a range of choices from thread-pool
 style, long-running task execution to non-blocking, high-volume task
 dispatching.
