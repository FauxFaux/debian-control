Description: generic frontend for proof assistants
 Proof General is a major mode to turn Emacs into an interactive proof
 assistant to write formal mathematical proofs using a variety of
 theorem provers.
 .
 This package provides Proof General support for Coq. (There is no
 other proof assistant that one could sensibly support.)
