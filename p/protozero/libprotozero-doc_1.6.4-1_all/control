Description: Minimalistic protocol buffer decoder and encoder in C++ - docs
 protozero is a minimalistic protocol buffer decoder and encoder in C++.
 .
 Designed for high performance. Suitable for writing zero copy parsers
 and encoders with minimal need for run-time allocation of memory.
 .
 Low-level: this is designed to be a building block for writing a very
 customized decoder for a stable protobuf schema. If your protobuf schema
 is changing frequently or lazy decoding is not critical for your
 application then this approach offers no value: just use the decoding
 API available via the C++ API that can be generated via the Google
 Protobufs protoc program.
 .
 This package contains the protozero documentation.
