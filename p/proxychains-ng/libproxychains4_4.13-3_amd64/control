Description: runtime shared library for proxychains-ng
 Proxychains is a UNIX program, that hooks network-related libc functions
 in dynamically linked programs via a preloaded DLL (dlsym(), LD_PRELOAD)
 and redirects the connections through SOCKS4a/5 or HTTP proxies.
 It supports TCP only (no UDP/ICMP etc).
 .
 This project, proxychains-ng, is the continuation of the unmaintained
 proxychains project (known as proxychains package in Debian).
 .
 This package provides the runtime shared library used by proxychains-ng
 program.
