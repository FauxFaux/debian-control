Description: proxy chains -- shared library (runtime)
 Proxy chains force any tcp connection made by any given tcp client
 to follow through proxy (or proxy chain). It is a kind of proxifier.
 It acts like sockscap / premeo / eborder driver ( intercepts TCP calls )
 .
 See 'proxychains' package for more detailed description.
 .
 This package contains runtime for the shared library used by proxychains.
 .
 The package 'dnsutils' is needed to perform DNS requests through proxy. In the
 case you turned 'proxy_dns' option off in configuration file you don't need
 dnsutils to be installed.
