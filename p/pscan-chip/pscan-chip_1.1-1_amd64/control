Description: ChIP-based identifcation of TF binding sites
 The regions on genomic DNA juxtaposed to regions that code for RNA or
 protein are known to feature many short regions to which proteins bind
 that are a requirement for the gene to be read out. These so called
 transcription factors (TFs) are proteins themselves and their abundance
 is dependent on yet other TFs. Much of the cellular differentiation to
 have different tissues and the dynamic molecular responses to stimuli
 are controlled transcriptionally.
 .
 The identification of the exact oligonucleotides to which TF may be
 binding are described statistically by an observed enrichment of motifs
 of such TF binding sites by software like pscan. This tool further
 constraints the search with data from ChIP-Seq experiments from which
 the regions of DNA that is covered by a TF may be described.
