 Psi IM is a capable XMPP client aimed at experienced users. There are
 keybindings for just about everything, Unicode is supported throughout,
 contacts are cached offline. Security is also a major consideration, and
 Psi IM provides it for both client-to-server (TLS) and client-to-client
 (GnuPG, OTR, OMEMO).
 .
 Psi+ is a development branch of Psi IM. Project purposes are:
 implementation of new features, writing of patches and plugins for
 transferring them to Psi IM.
