Description: Quantum Chemical Program Suite
 PSI4 is an ab-initio quantum chemistry program.  It is especially designed to
 accurately compute properties of small to medium molecules using highly
 correlated techniques. PSI4 is the parallelized successor of PSI3 and includes
 many state-of-the-art theoretical methods.
 .
 It can compute energies, gradients and hessians for the following methods:
  * Restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF)
 .
