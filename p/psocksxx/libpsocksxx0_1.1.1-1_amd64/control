Description: psocksxx is a C++ wrapper for POSIX sockets
 psocksxx library attempts to borrow the concepts from socket++ and
 socket-library, but not the code, and create a well documented (and
 hopefully easy to understand) POSIX socket communication wrapper in
 C++. To keep the code simple and clean this project will only support
 POSIX sockets.
