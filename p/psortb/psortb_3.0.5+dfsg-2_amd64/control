Description: bacterial localization prediction tool
 PSORTb enables prediction of bacterial protein subcellular localization
 (SCL) and provides a quick and inexpensive means for gaining insight
 into protein function, verifying experimental results, annotating newly
 sequenced bacterial genomes, detecting potential cell surface/secreted
 drug targets, as well as identifying biomarkers for microbes.
