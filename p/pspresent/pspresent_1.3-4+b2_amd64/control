Description: fullscreen PostScript presentation tool
 pspresent is a tool that displays PostScript slides in fullscreen, for
 giving presentations.  Navigation is simple: spacebar goes forward one
 slide, backspace takes you back one slide.  The escape key quits.  The
 display itself is double-buffered giving seamless transitions between
 slides.
