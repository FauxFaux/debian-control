Description: ODBC driver for PostgreSQL
 This package provides a driver that allows ODBC-enabled applications to
 access PostgreSQL databases.  ODBC is an abstraction layer that allows
 applications written for that layer to access databases in a manner
 that is relatively independent of the particular database management
 system.
 .
 You need to install this package if you want to use an application that
 provides database access through ODBC and you want that application to
 access a PostgreSQL database.  This package would need to be installed
 on the same machine as that client application; the PostgreSQL database
 server can be on a different machine and does not need any additional
 software to accept ODBC clients.
 .
 If you want to write software that can access a database through the
 ODBC abstraction layer, you need to install the unixODBC driver manager
 development package unixodbc-dev, and possibly additional packages for
 language bindings.  This driver package is only used at run time.
