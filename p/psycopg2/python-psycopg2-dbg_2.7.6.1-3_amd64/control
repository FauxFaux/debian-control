Description: Python module for PostgreSQL (debug extension)
 psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language
 (just like pygresql and popy.) This is version 2, a complete rewrite of the
 original code to provide new-style classes for connection and cursor objects
 and other sweet candies. Like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the
 aim of being very small and fast, and stable as a rock.
 .
 This package contains the extensions built for the Python debug interpreter.
