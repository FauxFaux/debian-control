Description: Python 3 module for PostgreSQL
 psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python3 programming language
 (just like pygresql and popy.) This is version 2, a complete rewrite of the
 original code to provide new-style classes for connection and cursor objects
 and other sweet candies. Like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the
 aim of being very small and fast, and stable as a rock.
 .
 psycopg is different from the other database adapter because it was designed
 for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy lots of
 cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs.
 psycopg 2 also provides full asynchronous operations for the really brave
 programmer.
 .
 The main advantages of psycopg2 are that it supports the full Python DBAPI-2.0
 and being thread safe at level 2. It also includes some extensions to the
 standard DBAPI-2.0 to allow for better thread performance.
