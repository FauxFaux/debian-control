Description: WebSocket pluggable transport - server
 Pluggable transports are tools that transform a stream of application traffic
 into a different format on the network. This helps to bypass network-level
 censorship.
 .
 This package contains a server transport plugin that accepts connections
 transformed to look like the websocket protocol. This is typically used to
 enhance systems like Tor, to provide service even to censored users.
 .
 See flashproxy-client for a corresponding client transport plugin, meant for
 users to bypass censorship, that is compatible with the websocket protocol that
 this package expects.
 .
 (The source package also contains a websocket-client transport plugin, but
 this is just a demo that is less effective than flashproxy-client, and not
 meant to be used in real situations.)
