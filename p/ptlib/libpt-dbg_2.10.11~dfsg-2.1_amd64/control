Description: Portable Tools Library development debug files
 This package contains the shared and static debug symbols of the library
 PTLib, which is a moderately large class library that has its genesis
 many years ago as a method to produce applications to run on both
 Microsoft Windows and Unix X-Window systems.  This is not the debug compiled
 version of PTLib which would yield much more detailled information as a
 compromise of benefit and compile power consumption.
