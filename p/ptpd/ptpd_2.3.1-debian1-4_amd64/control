Description: Precision Time Protocol daemon
 Implements the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) as defined by the IEEE
 1588-2008 standard. PTP was developed to provide very precise time
 coordination of LAN connected computers.
 .
 PTPd is a complete implementation of the IEEE 1588 specification for a
 standard (non-boundary) clock. PTPd has been tested with and is known
 to work properly with other IEEE 1588 implementations. The source code
 for PTPd is freely available under a BSD-style license. Thanks to
 contributions from users, PTPd is becoming an increasingly portable,
 interoperable, and stable IEEE 1588 implementation.
