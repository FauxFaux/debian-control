Description: accurate, machine-readable list of domain name suffixes
 A machine-readable list of domain name suffixes that accept public
 registration.  Each suffix represents the part of a domain name which
 is not under the control of the individual registrant, which makes
 the list useful for grouping cookies, deciding same-origin policies,
 collating spam, and other activities.
