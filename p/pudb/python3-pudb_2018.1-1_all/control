Description: full-screen, console-based Python3 debugger
 PuDB is a full-screen, console-based visual debugger for Python3.
 .
 Its goal is to provide all the niceties of modern GUI-based debuggers
 in a more lightweight and keyboard-friendly package. PuDB allows you
 to debug code right where you write and test it -- in a terminal. If
 you've worked with the excellent (but nowadays ancient) DOS-based
 Turbo Pascal or C tools, PuDB's UI might look familiar.
