Description: Parallel URL fetcher
 puf is a download tool for UNIX-like systems. You may use it to download
 single files or to mirror entire servers. It is similar to GNU wget
 (and has a partly compatible command line), but has the ability to do
 many downloads in parallel. This is very interesting, if you have a
 high-bandwidth internet connection.
