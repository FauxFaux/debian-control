Description: Light-weight C++ XML processing library
 pugixml is a lightweight C++ XML processing library with XPath
 support. It features:
  * DOM like interface with rich traversal/modification capabilities
  * Extermely fast non-validating XML parser which constructs the DOM
    tree from an XML file/buffer.
  * XPath 1.0 implementation for complex data-driven tree queries
  * Full Unicode support with Unicode interface variants and automatic
    encoding conversions.
 .
 This library is extremely portable and easy to integrate and use.
 .
 Since pugixml has a DOM parser, it can't process XML documents that do
 not fit in memory; also the parser is a non-validating one, so if you
 need DTD or XML Schema validation, the library is not for you.
