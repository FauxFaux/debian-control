Description: portable API for OpenGL graphical interfaces
 Pugl is a minimal portable API for OpenGL GUIs which supports
 embedding and is suitable for use in plugins, but can also be
 used for programs.
 .
 Pugl is vaguely similar to GLUT, but with some significant
 distinctions:
  * Minimal in scope, providing only what is necessary to draw
    and receive keyboard and mouse input.
  * No reliance on static data whatsoever, so the API can be
    used in plugins or multiple independent parts of a program.
  * Single implementation, which is small, liberally licensed
    and suitable for direct inclusion in programs if avoiding a
    library dependency is desired.
  * Support for embedding in other windows, so Pugl code can
    draw to a widget inside a larger GUI.
  * More complete support for keyboard input, including
    additional “special” keys, modifiers, and support for
    detecting individual modifier key presses.
