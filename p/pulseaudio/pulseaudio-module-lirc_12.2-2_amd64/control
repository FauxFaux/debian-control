Description: lirc module for PulseAudio sound server
 PulseAudio, previously known as Polypaudio, is a sound server for POSIX and
 WIN32 systems. It is a drop in replacement for the ESD sound server with
 much better latency, mixing/re-sampling quality and overall architecture.
 .
 This module enables the volume of a PulseAudio sink to be controlled when
 buttons of an infrared remote control are pressed (through LIRC).
 .
 The module is called module-lirc.
