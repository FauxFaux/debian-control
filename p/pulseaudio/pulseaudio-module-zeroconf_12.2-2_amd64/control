 PulseAudio, previously known as Polypaudio, is a sound server for POSIX and
 WIN32 systems. It is a drop in replacement for the ESD sound server with
 much better latency, mixing/re-sampling quality and overall architecture.

 This module enables PulseAudio to publish available sinks and sources via
 zeroconf (aka. Avahi, mdns).
 .
 The module is called module-zeroconf-publish.
