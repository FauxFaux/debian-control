Description: BOOTP and DHCP client for automatic IP configuration
 This is the BOOTP/DHCP client written by RedHat.
 .
 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and BOOTP (Boot Protocol)
 are protocols which allow individual devices on an IP network to get
 their own network configuration information (IP address, subnetmask,
 broadcast address, etc.) from network servers. The overall purpose of
 DHCP and BOOTP is to make it easier to administer a large network.
 .
 Pump is a combined BOOTP and DHCP client daemon, which allows your
 machine to retrieve configuration information from a server. You
 should install this package if you are on a network which uses BOOTP
 or DHCP.
