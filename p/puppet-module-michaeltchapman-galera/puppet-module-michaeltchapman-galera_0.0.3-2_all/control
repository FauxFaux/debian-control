Description: Michaelt Chapman's Galera Puppet module
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system using a
 cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate elements
 normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and hosts,
 along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services, and files.
 .
 This module manages both the installation and configuration of Galera.
