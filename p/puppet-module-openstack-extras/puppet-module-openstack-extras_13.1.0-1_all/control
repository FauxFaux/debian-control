Description: add useful utilities for composing and deploying OpenStack
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system using a
 cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate elements
 normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and hosts,
 along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services, and files.
 .
 This module is used to add useful utilities for composing and deploying
 OpenStack.
