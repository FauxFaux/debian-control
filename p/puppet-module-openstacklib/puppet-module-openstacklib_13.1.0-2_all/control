Description: exposes common functionality between Openstack modules as a library
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system using a
 cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate elements
 normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and hosts,
 along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services, and files.
 .
 This module is used to expose common functionality between Openstack modules as
 a library that can be utilized to avoid code duplication.
