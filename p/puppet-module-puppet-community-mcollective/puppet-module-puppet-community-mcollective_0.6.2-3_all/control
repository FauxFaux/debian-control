Description: Puppet module for mcollective to handle and install clusters
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system using a
 cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate elements
 normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and hosts,
 along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services, and files.
 .
 The mcollective module handles installing and configuring mcollective across a
 range of operating systems and distributions. Where possible it follows the
 standards laid down by the MCollective Standard Deployment guide.
