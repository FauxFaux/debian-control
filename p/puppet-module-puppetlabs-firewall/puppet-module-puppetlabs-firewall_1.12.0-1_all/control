Description: Puppet module for Firewall management
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system
 using a cross-platform specification language that manages all the
 separate elements normally aggregated in different files, like users,
 cron jobs, and hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like
 packages, services, and files.
 .
 The Firewall module lets you manage firewall rules with Puppet.
 This module offers support for iptables, ip6tables, and ebtables.
