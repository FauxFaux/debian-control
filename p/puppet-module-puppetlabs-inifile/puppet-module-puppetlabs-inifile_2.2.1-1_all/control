Description: Puppet module for ini files
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system
 using a cross-platform specification language that manages all the
 separate elements normally aggregated in different files, like users,
 cron jobs, and hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like
 packages, services, and files.
 .
 This Package contains a Puppet module which provides resource types
 for use in managing ini-style configuration files. The main resource
 type is ini_setting, which is used to manage an individual setting
 in an ini file.
