Description: Puppet module for managing mongodb installation and configuration
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system using a
 cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate elements
 normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and hosts,
 along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services, and files.
 .
 The MongoDB module manages mongod server installation and configuration of the
 mongod daemon. For the time being it supports only a single MongoDB server
 instance, without sharding functionality.
