Description: Puppet module for MySQL
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system
 using a cross-platform specification language that manages all the
 separate elements normally aggregated in different files, like users,
 cron jobs, and hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like
 packages, services, and files.
 .
 This module manages both the installation and configuration of MySQL as well as
 extends Pupppet to allow management of MySQL resources, such as databases,
 users and grants.
