Description: Puppet module for rabbitmq, manage everything from vhosts to exchanges
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system using a
 cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate elements
 normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and hosts,
 along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services, and files.
 .
 The rabbitmq module sets up rabbitmq and has a number of providers to manage
 everything from vhosts to exchanges after setup.
