Description: Puppet module for rsync clients, repositories, and servers
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system using a
 cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate elements
 normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and hosts,
 along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services, and files.
 .
 puppetlabs-rsync manages rsync clients, repositories, and servers as well as
 providing defines to easily grab data via rsync.
