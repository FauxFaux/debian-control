Description: Puppet module for managing tftp-hpa
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system using a
 cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate elements
 normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and hosts,
 along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services, and files.
 .
 This module will install tftp-hpa as a xinetd service by default. It can be
 overridden to run as a standalone daemon by setting the inetd parameter to
 false.
 .
 Parameters:
  * username: tftp daemon user, default tftp
  * directory: service directory, default see params class.
  * address: bind address, default 0.0.0.0.
  * port: bind port, default 69.
  * options: service option, default --secure.
  * inetd: run service via xinetd, default true.
