Description: use Puppet to easily deploy content from your version control system (VCS)
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system using a
 cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate elements
 normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and hosts,
 along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services, and files.
 .
 The vcsrepo module lets you use Puppet to easily deploy content from your
 version control system (VCS).
