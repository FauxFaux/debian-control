Description: Puppet module for data structure rendered using a template
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system using a
 cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate elements
 normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and hosts,
 along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services, and files.
 .
 The datacat and datacat_fragment types allow you to build up a data structure
 which is rendered using a template. This is similar to some of the common
 concatenation patterns though the intent should be clearer as it pushes the
 boilerplate down into the type.
