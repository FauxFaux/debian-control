Description: Puppet module for corosync / pacemaker
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system using a
 cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate elements
 normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs, and hosts,
 along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services, and files.
 .
 puppet-corosync manages things like virtual IP shared in a cluster.
