Description: configuration management system, scalable master service
 Puppet is a configuration management system that allows you to define
 the state of your IT infrastructure, then automatically enforces the
 correct state.
 .
 This package provides configuration for apache2 with mod_passenger,
 suitable for large deployments. This offers better scalability than
 the "puppet-master" package.
