Description: configuration management system, master service
 Puppet is a configuration management system that allows you to define
 the state of your IT infrastructure, then automatically enforces the
 correct state.
 .
 This package contains the "puppet-master" service and init script,
 which is suitable for small deployments. For larger deployments or if you wish
 to support Puppet 3 clients, puppet-master-passenger should be used instead.
