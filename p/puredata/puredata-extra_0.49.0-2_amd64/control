Description: realtime computer music and graphics system - extra files
 Pure Data (also known as Pd) is a real-time graphical programming environment
 for audio and graphics processing.
 .
 This package provides extra objects that come with Pd, e.g. for signal
 analysis (fiddle~, sigmund~, bonk~) and more.
 .
 The objects for expression evaluation (expr~) have been included into
 puredata-core, so they are no longer part of this package.
