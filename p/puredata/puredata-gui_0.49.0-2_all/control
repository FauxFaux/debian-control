Description: realtime computer music and graphics system - GUI
 Pure Data (also known as Pd) is a real-time graphical programming environment
 for audio and graphics processing.
 .
 This package provides the graphical user-interface for Pure Data.
 Most likely you will want to install "puredata-core" (or even "puredata")
 as well.
 Installing this package without the accompanying puredata-core is only useful
 if you want to run the GUI and the DSP on different machines.
