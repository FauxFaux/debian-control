Description: realtime computer music and graphics system
 Pure Data (also known as Pd) is a real-time graphical programming environment
 for audio and graphics processing. Pd's audio functions are built-in;
 graphical computations require separate packages such as gem (Graphics
 Environment for Multimedia) or pd-pdp (Pd Packet).
 .
 This is a metapackage that depends on all components of the core of Pd.
