Description: Development files for the purelibc library
 purelibc is an overlay library that converts the glibc, the GNU standard C
 library, into a pure library, i.e. a library that can upcall instead of
 running the system calls. With purelibc a process can trace (and virtualize)
 its own calls. It is used, for instance, by the UMView modules to support
 the recursion of virtual environments.
 .
 purelibc, along with UMView, is part of the View-OS project:
 http://wiki.virtualsquare.org
 .
 This package contains the files needed to compile applications that link
 purelibc.
