Description: Routines for radio interferometric imaging (shared lib)
 PURIFY is a collection of routines written in C that implements different
 tools for radio interferometric imaging including file handling (for both
 visibilities and fits files), implementation of the measurement operator
 and set-up of the different optimization problems used for image
 deconvolution. The code calls the generic Sparse OPTimization (SOPT)
 package to solve the imaging optimization problems.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
