Description: URL interrogation and manipulation (PyPy version)
 A simple, immutable URL class with a clean API for interrogation and
 manipulation that also supports template URLs as per RFC 6570.
 It parses URLs into URL objects which are immutable but also provides mutator
 methods for all segments which return a new URL instance. This allows for
 easy modification of URLs during runtime.
 .
 This package contains the PyPy version of the library.
