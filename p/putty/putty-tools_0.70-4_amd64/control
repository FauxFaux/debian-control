Description: command-line tools for SSH, SCP, and SFTP
 This package provides four command-line tools from the PuTTY suite that
 allow various kinds of secure interaction with remote systems.
 .
 Plink (PuTTY Link) connects to a remote system via SSH, Telnet, or rlogin,
 and either starts an interactive session or runs a batch process. It
 supports the usual SSH features like port forwarding, X11 forwarding,
 SOCKS, and compression.
 .
 PSCP (PuTTY Secure Copy) transfers files securely between systems using an
 SSH connection. It works with both SSH protocol 1 and protocol 2.
 .
 PSFTP (PuTTY SFTP client) transfers files securely between systems using
 the SSH file transfer protocol, which is specific to SSH protocol 2. In
 interactive mode its interface is much like the traditional Unix FTP
 client, although it can also operate in batch mode.
 .
 PuTTYgen generates SSH public and private key pairs in any of a number of
 formats, including those usable by PuTTY, OpenSSH, and ssh.com.
 .
 All these utilities can make use of PuTTY's saved sessions where
 appropriate.
