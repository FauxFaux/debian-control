Description: Creates a menu.lst file for PV-GRUB
 PV-GRUB is a utility of the vitualisation platform Xen, to boot virtual
 machines with their own kernel.  This package maintains a configuration file in
 /boot/grub/menu.lst, that is read by PV-GRUB.  It does nothing else, which
 means that it is not suitable for booting non-virtual systems.
