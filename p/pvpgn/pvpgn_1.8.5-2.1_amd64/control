Description: gaming server that emulates Battle.net(R)
 The server currently implements most of the same functionality as the
 real Battle.net(R) servers from Blizzard Entertainment.  You can chat,
 play games, use / commands, and things like account passwords, user
 icons, ad banners, and channel operators work too.  It is by no means
 complete, though.
