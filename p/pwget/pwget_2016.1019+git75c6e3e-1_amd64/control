Description: downloader utility which resembles wget (implemented in Perl)
 Pwget is similar to wget(1) but it can use categorized configuration
 files, analyze Web pages, and "search" for download links as
 instructed. Instead of absolute links, it contains heuristics to
 track newer versions of files.
