Description: ps and top for human beings
 px will, unlike ps:
  - Decode Python, Ruby, Node, bash and Java command lines and show you what is
    actually running.
  - Can filter processes by owner ("px root")
  - Can search for processes by command line ("px java", like "pgrep")
  - List processes in a helpful order
 .
 ptop will, unlike top:
  - Decode Python, Ruby, Node, bash and Java command lines and show you
    what's actually running.
  - Has stable output by counting CPU time since ptop started
  - Visualize system load using a histogram rather than just presenting the
    three uptime numbers
  - Visualize system load in relation to the number of logical and physical
    cores in the system
