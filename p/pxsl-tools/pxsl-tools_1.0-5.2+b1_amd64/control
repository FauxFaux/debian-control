Description: Parsimonious XML Shorthand Language
 PXSL ("pixel") provides XML authors and programmers with a simple,
 concise syntax that they can use to create XML documents.
 .
 For more advanced users, PXSL offers customizable shortcuts and
 sophisticated refactoring tools like functional macros that can
 markedly reduce the size and complexity of markup-dense XML
 documents.
 .
 The short version is this: PXSL is XML turned inside-out. Instead of
 tagging the structure, you tag the non-structure, which is the better
 approach when most of your information is structure.
 .
 Also, PXSL lets users intermix PXSL and XML syntax in one
 document. Users are free to use whichever syntax works best for each
 portion of their documents.
