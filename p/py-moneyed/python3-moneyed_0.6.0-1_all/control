Description: Currency and Money classes for use in Python 3 code
 The need to represent instances of money frequently arises in software
 development, particularly any financial/economics software. To address that
 need, this package provides the classes of Money and Currency, at a level more
 useful than just using Python's Decimal class, or even the float primitive.
 The package is meant to be stand-alone and easy to either use directly, or
 subclass further.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version of the package.
