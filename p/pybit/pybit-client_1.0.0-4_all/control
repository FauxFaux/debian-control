Description: buildd client support for pybit
 pyBit uses message queues to create a distributed, cross-platform
 buildd toolkit using a collection of buildds, using source from
 various VCS clients. pyBit is intended to support rapidly evolving
 software collections and can support multiple VCS frontends and
 multiple build backends.
 .
 This package provides the Debian buildd client for pyBit to build
 packages using sbuild.
 .
 Each pyBit buildd client needs to install and configure this package
 to give each client a unique identifier per pyBit database.
