Description: Subversion post commit hook for pybit
 pyBit uses message queues to create a distributed, cross-platform
 buildd toolkit using a collection of buildds, using source from
 various VCS clients. pyBit is intended to support rapidly evolving
 software collections and can support multiple VCS frontends and
 multiple build backends.
 .
 This package provides a Subversion post commit hook to check for
 interesting changes in the repository and post a directory back
 to the controller using curl.
 .
 Currently, only Subversion is supported. The svn hook
 does not depend on the rest of pyBit or on Python.
