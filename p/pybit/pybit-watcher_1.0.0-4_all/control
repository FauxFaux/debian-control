Description: watches incoming directories for reprepro
 pyBit uses message queues to create a distributed, cross-platform
 buildd toolkit using a collection of buildds, using source from
 various VCS clients. pyBit is intended to support rapidly evolving
 software collections and can support multiple VCS frontends and
 multiple build backends.
 .
 This package provides a watcher which runs as a daemon and monitors a
 directory for changes files then runs the appropriate reprepro rule.
 .
 This allows pybit clients to upload without waiting for the packages
 to be processed by reprepro.
