Description: buildd toolkit based on message queues (web frontend)
 pyBit uses message queues to create a distributed, cross-platform
 buildd toolkit using a collection of buildds, using source from
 various VCS clients. pyBit is intended to support rapidly evolving
 software collections and can support multiple VCS frontends and
 multiple build backends.
 .
 This package provides a reporting and custom-build request
 interface for the status database and the controller agent for
 PyBit. The static web pages do need to be served from the same
 machine as is running the pybit-web application.
 .
 A single RabbitMQ server is also required, it can be installed on
 any machine which is visible to the controller and all clients.
