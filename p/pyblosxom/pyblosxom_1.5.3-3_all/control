Description: lightweight file-based weblog system written in Python
 Pyblosxom is a blog which allows you to keep an online journal. It acts as an
 extension for a web server such as Apache and can be run as a CGI script or a
 WSGI application. Another common purpose of Pyblosxom is to statically compile
 your website into HTML/XML files.
 .
 It is very easy to set up and use. Entries are stored in simple text files and
 can be categorized using directories. Pyblosxom has a plugin framework
 enabling you to augment and enhance Pyblosxom's default behaviour as well as a
 template engine to make it easy to design your own themes with a minimum of
 development knowledge.
 .
 Pyblosxom also supports RSS 2.0 and Atom syndication feeds.
