Description: Certification Authority written in Python
 pyca is a set of Python scripts written Michael Str√∂der. They provide an
 almost fully fledged  Certification Authority.
 Support for issueing email and authentication certificates works fine.
 .
 Most notably spooling of requests and certificates between the public and
 the private parts of the CA remains to be written.
 .
 Other than that the documentation and scripts provided are of good quality
 and may facilitate using and understanding the CA capabilities of OpenSSL.
 .
 The required webserver must provide CGI support.
