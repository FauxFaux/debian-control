Description: tool to find common bugs in Python source code
 PyChecker is a tool for finding common bugs in Python source code.
 It finds problems that are typically caught by a compiler for less
 dynamic languages, like C and C++. Because of the dynamic nature of Python,
 some warnings may be incorrect; however, spurious warnings should be
 fairly infrequent.
