Description: tool for fitting correlation curves on a logarithmic plot
 PyCorrFit is a general-purpose FCS evaluation software that,
 amongst other formats, supports the established Zeiss ConfoCor3 ~.fcs
 file format. PyCorrFit comes with several built-in model functions,
 covering a wide range of applications in standard confocal FCS.
 In addition, it contains equations dealing with different excitation
 geometries like total internal reflection (TIR).
