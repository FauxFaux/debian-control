Description: cryptographic Python library (documentation)
 PyCryptodome is a self-contained Python package of low-level
 cryptographic primitives.
 .
 PyCryptodome is a fork of PyCrypto. It brings several enhancements
 with respect to the last official version of PyCrypto (2.6.1),
 for instance:
 .
   * Authenticated encryption modes (GCM, CCM, EAX, SIV, OCB)
   * Accelerated AES on Intel platforms via AES-NI
   * First class support for PyPy
   * Elliptic curves cryptography (NIST P-256 curve only)
   * Better and more compact API (`nonce` and `iv` attributes for ciphers,
     automatic generation of random nonces and IVs, simplified CTR cipher mode,
     and more)
   * SHA-3 (including SHAKE XOFs) and BLAKE2 hash algorithms
   * Salsa20 and ChaCha20 stream ciphers
   * scrypt and HKDF
   * Deterministic (EC)DSA
   * Password-protected PKCS#8 key containers
   * Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme
   * Random numbers get sourced directly from the OS (and not from a CSPRNG in
     userspace)
   * Simplified install process, including better support for Windows
   * Cleaner RSA and DSA key generation (largely based on FIPS 186-4)
   * Major clean ups and simplification of the code base
 .
 PyCryptodome is not a wrapper to a separate C library like *OpenSSL*.
 To the largest possible extent, algorithms are implemented in pure Python.
 Only the pieces that are extremely critical to performance (e.g. block ciphers)
 are implemented as C extensions.
 .
 This is the documentation package.
