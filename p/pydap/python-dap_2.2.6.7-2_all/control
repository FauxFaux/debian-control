Description: DAP (Data Access Protocol) client and server
 This is a Python implementation of the Data Access Protocol, a scientific
 protocol for data access developed by the OPeNDAP team
 (http://opendap.org). This implementation is developed from scratch, following
 the latest specification of the protocol (DAP 2.0 Draft Community Standard
 2005/04/27) and based on experience with OPeNDAP servers on the wild.
 .
 Using this module one can access hundreds of scientific datasets from Python
 programs, accessing data in an efficient, transparent and pythonic way. Arrays
 are manipulated like normal multi-dimensional arrays (like numpy.array, e.g.),
 with the fundamental difference that data is downloaded on-the-fly when a
 variable is sliced.  Sequential data can be filtered on the server side before
 being downloaded, saving bandwidth and time.
 .
 The module also implements a DAP server, allowing datasets from a multitude of
 formats (netCDF, Matlab, CSV, GrADS/GRIB files, SQL RDBMS) to be served on the
 internet. The server specifies a plugin API for supporting new data formats in
 an easy way. The DAP server is implemented as a WSGI application (see PEP 333),
 running on a variety of servers, and can be combined with WSGI middleware to
 support authentication, gzip compression and much more.
