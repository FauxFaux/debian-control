Description: deterministically generate identicons in Python 3
 Pydenticon is a small utility library that can be used for deterministically
 generating identicons based on the hash of provided data.
 .
 The implementation is a port of the Sigil identicon implementation.
 .
 Pydenticon provides a couple of extensions of its own when compared to the
 original Sigil implementation, like:
 .
 * Ability to supply custom digest algorithms (allowing for larger identicons if
   digest provides enough entropy).
 * Ability to specify a rectangle for identicon size.
 .
 This package is for Python 3.
