Description: Python API to interact with EOS network devices - docs
 The Python Client for eAPI (pyeapi) is a native Python library
 wrapper around Arista EOS eAPI.  It provides a set of Python language
 bindings for configuring Arista EOS nodes. It can be used either on a
 local node (running EOS) or on a remote node.
 .
 This library also provides an API layer for building native Python
 objects to interact with the destination nodes. The API layer is a
 convenient implementation for working with the EOS configuration and
 is extensible for developing custom implementations. For example, it
 allows one to list VLAN or configure a BGP session.
 .
 This package contains the documentation.
