Description: Compute positions of the planets and stars with Python 2
 PyEphem provides an ephem Python package for performing high-precision
 astronomy computations. The underlying numeric routines are coded in C and
 are the same ones that drive the popular XEphem astronomy application, whose
 author, Elwood Charles Downey, generously gave permission for their use in
 PyEphem.
 .
 The name ephem is short for the word ephemeris, which is the
 traditional term for a table giving the position of a planet, asteroid, or
 comet for a series of dates.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 version of the package.
