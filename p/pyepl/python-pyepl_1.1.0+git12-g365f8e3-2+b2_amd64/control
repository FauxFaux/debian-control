Description: module for coding psychology experiments in Python
 PyEPL is a stimuli delivery and response registration toolkit to be
 used for generating psychology (as well as neuroscience, marketing
 research, and other) experiments.
 .
 It provides
  - presentation: both visual and auditory stimuli
  - responses registration: both manual (keyboard/joystick) and
    sound (microphone) time-stamped
  - sync-pulsing: synchronizing your behavioral task with external
    acquisition hardware
  - flexibility of encoding various experiments due to the use of
    Python as a description language
  - fast execution of critical points due to the calls to linked
    compiled libraries
 .
 This toolbox is here to be an alternative for a widely used
 commercial product E'(E-Prime)
 .
 This package provides PyEPL for supported versions of Python.
