Description: Python ENVISAT Product Reader API (common documentation)
 PyEPR provides Python bindings for the ENVISAT Product Reader C API
 (EPR API) for reading satellite data from ENVISAT ESA (European Space
 Agency) mission.
 .
 PyEPR, as well as the EPR API for C, supports ENVISAT MERIS, AATSR
 Level 1B and Level 2 and also ASAR data products. It provides access
 to the data either on a geophysical (decoded, ready-to-use pixel
 samples) or on a raw data layer. The raw data access makes it possible
 to read any data field contained in a product file.
 .
 This is the common documentation package.
