Description: documentation for the Pyevolve genetic algorithm framework
 Pyevolve was developed to be a complete genetic algorithm framework written in
 pure Python. It provides an easy-to-use API, implementing the most common
 features of GA, including various selectors and scaling schemes. It is also
 easily extendable, allowing users to create new representations and genetic
 operators. Various methods of interactive and non-interactive visualization
 are supported.
 .
 This package contains the documentation for Pyevolve in HTML form, and some
 examples.
