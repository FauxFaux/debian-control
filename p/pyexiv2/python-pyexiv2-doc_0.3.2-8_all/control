Description: Documentation for Python binding to Exiv2
 pyexiv2 is a Python binding to Exiv2, the C++ library for manipulation
 of EXIF and IPTC image metadata. It is a Python module that allows your
 Python scripts to read and write metadata (EXIF, IPTC, XMP, thumbnail)
 embedded in image files (JPEG, TIFF, ...).
 .
 It is designed as a high level interface to the functionalities offered
 by exiv2 (and is built on top of it). Using Python's built-in data
 types and standard modules, it provides easy manipulation of image
 metadata.
