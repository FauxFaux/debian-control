Description: Pythonic wrapper around FFTW - Python 2
 Pythonic wrapper around FFTW, the speedy FFT library. The ultimate
 aim is to present a unified interface for all the possible transforms
 that FFTW can perform.
 .
 Both the complex DFT and the real DFT are supported, as well as
 arbitrary axes of abitrary shaped and strided arrays, which makes it
 almost feature equivalent to standard and real FFT functions of
 numpy.fft (indeed, it supports the clongdouble dtype which numpy.fft
 does not).
 .
 pyFFTW is BSD-licensed and should not be confused with python-fftw, a
 GPL-licensed python module with the same aim of providing python
 bindings to FFTW3. Or python-gpyfft, which provides bindings to the
 OpenCL FFT library clFFT.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2 bindings.
