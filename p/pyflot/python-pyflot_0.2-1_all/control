Description: interface from Python to libjs-flot
 PyFlot makes it easy to generate flot graphs. Its primary goal
 is to allow one to specify data inputs and options in a Python
 application and generate the appropriate JSON. Common uses of this
 are rendering into a template as flot() arguments or as the payload of
 an XHR response. PyFlot takes care of all the annoying details of
 converting types to match up with how flot expects them.
