Description: documentation for PyFR
 PyFR is an open-source Python based framework for solving advection-diffusion
 type problems on streaming architectures using the Flux Reconstruction
 approach of Huynh. The framework is designed to solve a range of governing
 systems on mixed unstructured grids containing various element types. It is
 also designed to target a range of hardware platforms via use of an in-built
 domain specific language derived from the Mako templating engine.
