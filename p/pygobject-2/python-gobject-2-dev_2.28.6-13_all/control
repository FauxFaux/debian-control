Description: development headers for the static GObject Python bindings
 GObject is an abstraction layer that allows programming with an object
 paradigm that is compatible with many languages. It is a part of Glib,
 the core library used to build GTK+ and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains the development headers needed to build
 static Python bindings relying on pygobject. Note that this is obsolete, new
 libraries and applications should use the dynamic gobject-introspection
 bindings (which are provided with the python-gobject package).
