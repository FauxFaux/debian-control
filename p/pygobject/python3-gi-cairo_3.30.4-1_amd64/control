Description: Python 3 Cairo bindings for the GObject library
 GObject is an abstraction layer that allows programming with an object
 paradigm that is compatible with many languages. It is a part of Glib,
 the core library used to build GTK+ and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 Cairo bindings for GObject. It is mostly
 used by other bindings to map their GObjects to Python objects.
