 PyHamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects, allowing you to
 declaratively define "match" rules. There are a number of situations where
 matchers are invaluable, such as UI validation, or data filtering, but it is in
 the area of writing flexible tests that matchers are most commonly used. This
 tutorial shows you how to use PyHamcrest for unit testing.

 When writing tests it is sometimes difficult to get the balance right between
 overspecifying the test (and making it brittle to changes), and not specifying
 enough (making the test less valuable since it continues to pass even when the
 thing being tested is broken). Having a tool that allows you to pick out
