Description: Python implementation of java.util.Properties
 This module is designed to be a Python equivalent to the java.util.Properties
 class. Currently, the basic input/output methods are supported, and there are
 plans to add the XML input/output methods found in J2SE 5.0.
 .
 Fundamentally, this module is designed so that users can easily parse and
 manipulate Java Properties files - that's it. There's a fair number of
 Pythonistas who work in multi-language shops, and constantly writing your own
 parsing mechanism is just painful. Not to mention Java guys are notoriously
 unwilling to use anything which is cross-language for configuration, unless
 it's XML, which is a form of self-punishment. :)
 .
 This package provides the Python 3.x module.
