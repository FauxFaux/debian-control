Description: Libravatar module for Python 2
 Module to make use of the federated Libravatar.org avatar hosting service
 from within Python applications.
 .
 Libravatar is a free service for hosting profile images tied to an email
 address or an OpenID. Inspired by the elegant solution pioneered by
 Gravatar, Libravatar takes a federated approach to the problem and allows
 domain owners to specify the server that should host images for their
 organisation.
 .
 This package provides Python 2 module bindings only.
