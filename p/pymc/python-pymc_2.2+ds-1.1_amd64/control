Description: Bayesian statistical models and fitting algorithms
 PyMC is a Python module that implements Bayesian statistical models
 and fitting algorithms, including Markov chain Monte Carlo. Its
 flexibility and extensibility make it applicable to a large suite of
 problems. Along with core sampling functionality, PyMC includes
 methods for summarizing output, plotting, goodness-of-fit and
 convergence diagnostics.
