Description: Domain Keys Identified Mail Milter for Sendmail and Postfix
 A simple Python mail filter for creating and verifying Domain Keys Identified
 Mail (DKIM) signatures.  While not as featureful as some other
 implementations, like opendkim, because it is written in Python, it is a
 good choice for experimentation and customization.
