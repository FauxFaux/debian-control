Description: full Modbus protocol implementation for Python 2
 Pymodbus is a full Modbus protocol implementation.
 It is currently supports the following :
 .
 Client Features:
  * Can perform single get/set on discrete and registers
  * Can perform multiple get/set on discrete and registers
  * Working on diagnostic/file/pipe/setting/info requests
  * Can fully scrape a host to be cloned
 .
 Server Features:
  * Can function as a fully implemented TCP/ASCII modbus server
  * Full server control context
  * Working on serial communication
  * Working on functioning as a RTU
  * Can mimic a server based on the supplied input data
 .
 For asynchronous communication, you need python-twisted-core.
 For serial communication, you need python-serial.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2.x module.
