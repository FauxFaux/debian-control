Description: Molecular Graphics System
 PyMOL is a molecular graphics system targeted at medium to large
 biomolecules like proteins. It can generate high-quality publication-ready
 molecular graphics images and animations.
 .
 Features include:
  * Visualization of molecules, molecular trajectories and surfaces
    of crystallography data or orbitals
  * Molecular builder and sculptor
  * Internal raytracer and movie generator
  * Fully extensible and scriptable via a Python interface
 .
 File formats PyMOL can read include PDB, XYZ, CIF, MDL Molfile, ChemDraw,
 CCP4 maps, XPLOR maps and Gaussian cube maps.
