Description: Engine for symbolic geometric calculus for Python (development files)
 Pynac (which stands for "Python is Not a CAS") is a fork of GiNaC that
 replaces the dependency of GiNaC on CLN (Class Library for Numbers, C++) by
 a dependency on Python.
 .
 This is the library for symbolic geometric calculus in Python,
 as used in SAGE (http://www.sagemath.org)
 .
 This package contains the development files for the library.
