Description: Python bindings for the NFFT3 library - Python 3
 This package provides Python bindings to the NFFT library, useful for
 performing Fourier transforms on non-uniformly sampled data with efficient
 speed. The bindings were generated using Cython and abstract the creation
 and execution of NFFT plans out using classes.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3 version of the bindings.
