Description: flexible and componentized presentation program
 Pyntor is a small, flexible and componentized presentation program. It
 is built upon Python and the SDL library (via pygame). Pyntor features
 a wiki-like presentation component, a HTML page component
 (Pyromaniac), and several more. Standard features like PDF/HTML
 export, page selection and interactivity are available, as are
 advanced features such as full-text search in the presentation slides.
 .
 Due to the minimal size and maximum configurability, Pyntor is a nice
 alternative to conventional presentation programs.
