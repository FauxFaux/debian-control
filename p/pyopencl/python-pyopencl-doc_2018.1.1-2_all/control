Description: module to access OpenCL parallel computation API (documentation)
 PyOpenCL lets you access the OpenCL parallel computation API from
 Python. Here's what sets PyOpenCL apart:
  * Object cleanup tied to lifetime of objects. This idiom, often called
    RAII in C++, makes it much easier to write correct, leak- and
    crash-free code.
  * Completeness. PyOpenCL puts the full power of OpenCL’s API at your
    disposal, if you wish.
  * Convenience. While PyOpenCL's primary focus is to make all of OpenCL
    accessible, it tries hard to make your life less complicated as it
    does so--without taking any shortcuts.
  * Automatic Error Checking. All OpenCL errors are automatically
    translated into Python exceptions.
  * Speed. PyOpenCL’s base layer is written in C++, so all the niceties
    above are virtually free.
  * Helpful, complete documentation and a wiki.
  * Liberal licensing (MIT).
