Description: PyORBit: development files
 It aims to take advantage of new features found in ORBit2 to make
 language bindings more efficient.  This includes:
   - Use of ORBit2 type libraries to generate stubs
   - use of the ORBit_small_invoke_stub() call for operation
     invocation, which allows for short circuited invocation on local
     objects.
 .
 Where it makes sense, this binding tries to stay compatible with the
 Python language mapping, which can be found on the OMG web site:
     http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/02-09-07
 .
 This package contains development files necessary to develop extensions
 for the module using the C language.
