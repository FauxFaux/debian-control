Description: CUPS PostScript Printer Driver's compressor and generator
 pyppd is a CUPS PPD generator. It holds an compressed archive of PPDs, which
 can be listed and retrieved only when needed by CUPS, saving disk space.
 .
 This tool is mostly useful as build-dependency for printing driver packages.
 For this use, it provides a Debian-specific dh_pyppd Debhelper addon that
 handles the pyppd launch and the cleanup after it.
