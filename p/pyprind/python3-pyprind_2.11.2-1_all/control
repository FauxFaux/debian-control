Description: Python Progress Bar and Percent Indicator Utility
 The PyPrind (Python Progress Indicator) module provides a progress
 bar and a percentage indicator object that let you track the progress
 of a loop structure or other iterative computation.  Typical
 applications include the processing of large data sets to provide an
 intuitive estimate at runtime about the progress of the computation.
