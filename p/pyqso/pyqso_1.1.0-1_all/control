Description: logging tool for amateur radio operators
 PyQSO is a logging tool for amateur radio operators. It provides a simple
 graphical interface through which users can manage information about the
 contacts/QSOs they make with other operators on the air. All information is
 stored in a light-weight SQL database. Other key features include:
 .
  * Customisable interface (e.g. only show callsign and frequency information).
  * Import and export logs in ADIF format.
  * Perform callsign lookups and auto-fill data fields using the qrz.com
    database.
  * Sort the logs by individual fields.
  * Print a hard-copy of logs, or print to PDF.
  * Connect to Telnet-based DX clusters.
  * Progress tracker for the DXCC award.
  * Grey line plotter.
  * Filter out QSOs based on the callsign field (e.g. only display contacts
    with callsigns beginning with “M6”).
  * Remove duplicate QSOs.
  * Basic support for the Hamlib library.
