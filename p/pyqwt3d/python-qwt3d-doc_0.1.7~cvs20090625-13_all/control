 PyQwt3D is a set of Python bindings for the QwtPlot3D C++ class
 library which extends the Qt framework with widgets to visualize
 3-dimensional data. This package contains documentation and
 examples for both Qt3 and Qt4. The  examples show how easy it is
 to make a 3D plot and how to save a 3D plot to an image or an
 (E)PS/PDF file.
