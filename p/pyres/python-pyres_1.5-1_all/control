Description: Python module to provide a Resque-like job queue
 Pyres - a Resque clone
 .
 Resque is a great implementation of a job queue by the people at
 github. It's written in ruby, which is great, but I primarily work in
 python. So I took on the task of porting over the code to python and
 PyRes was the result
 .
 Project Goals
 .
 Because of some differences between ruby and python, there are a
 couple of places where I chose speed over correctness. The goal will
 be to eventually take the application and make it more pythonic
 without sacrificing the awesome functionality found in resque. At the
 same time, I hope to stay within the bounds of the original api and
 web interface.
