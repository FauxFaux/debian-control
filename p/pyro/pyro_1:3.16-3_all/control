Description: distributed object system for Python
 Pyro (PYthon Remote Object) is an easy to use and powerful distributed object
 system for Python. In a distributed object system, clients send requests to
 distant servers, which owns the remote objects. Pyro simplifies a lot the
 creation of clients and servers, and has among its features:
  - dynamic and static proxies for all remote method invocations,
  - a naming service which keeps record of the location of objects,
  - mobile objects support: clients and servers can pass objects around,
  - exceptions that occur in the remote object is raised on the client too,
  - multithreaded server support to handle multiple requests simultaneously.
 .
 This package contains the core Pyro library and the command line tools.
 .
 Some graphical tools are available in the pyro-gui package.
 The documentation is available in the pyro-doc package.
 A lot of examples are available in the pyro-examples package.
