Description: Very fast firewall configuration tool
 Pyroman is a firewall tool written in Python for complex networks,
 but it can of course also handle simple single-host-single-link setups.
 .
 Interesting features:
  * Fast, due to use of iptables-restore for mass setting of rules
  * Rollback to previous firewall configuration on errors
  * Safety options to prevent mistakes in configuration (success confirmation
    prompt and/or scripted external verification)
  * Detailed error reporting
  * Lots of verification checks done before execution
  * Powerful yet clean configuration files (in Python and/or XML)
  * Designed for multiple hosts, firewalls, networks
  * Consistent firewalls for IPv4 and IPv6
 .
 Pyroman is inspired by Shorewall and FireHOL, but tries to improve upon them
 with respect to performance and ease of configuration.
 .
 Pyroman currently only configures iptables/netfilter firewalls, it does
 not include configuration utilities for setting up VPN or traffic shaping.
