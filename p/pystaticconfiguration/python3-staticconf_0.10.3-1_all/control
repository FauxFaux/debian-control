Description: Python library for loading and reading configuration (Python 3)
 This package contains PyStaticConfiguration, a Python library for loading,
 validating and reading configuration from many heterogeneous formats.
 Configuration is split into two phases.
   * Configuration Loading: configuration is read from files or Python objects,
     flattened, and merged into a container called a `namespace`. Namespaces
     are used to separate unrelated configuration groups. If configuration is
     changed frequently, it can also be reloaded easily with very little change
     to the existing code.
   * Configuration Reading: a configuration value is looked up in the
     `namespace`. It is validating and converted to the requested type.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
