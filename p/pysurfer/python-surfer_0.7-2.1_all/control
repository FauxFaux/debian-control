Description: visualize Freesurfer's data in Python
 This is a Python package for visualization and interaction with cortical
 surface representations of neuroimaging data from Freesurfer. It
 extends Mayavi’s powerful visualization engine with a high-level interface for
 working with MRI and MEG data.
 .
 PySurfer offers both a command-line interface designed to broadly replicate
 Freesurfer’s Tksurfer program as well as a Python library for writing scripts
 to efficiently explore complex datasets.
Python-Version: 2.7
