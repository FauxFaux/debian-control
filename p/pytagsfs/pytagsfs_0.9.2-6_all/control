Description: maps media files to an arbitrary directory structure
 pytagsfs is a FUSE filesystem that arranges media files in a virtual directory
 structure based on the file tags.
 .
 A set of audio files could be mapped to a new directory structure organizing
 them hierarchically by album, genre, release date, etc.
 .
 File tags can be changed by moving and renaming virtual files and directories.
 The virtual files can be modified, opened and played just like regular files.
