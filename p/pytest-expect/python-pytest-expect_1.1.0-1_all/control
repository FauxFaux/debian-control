Description: py.test plugin to store test expectations
 A py.test plugin that stores test expectations by saving the set of failing
 tests, allowing them to be marked as xfail when running them in future. The
 tests expectations are stored such that they can be distributed alongside the
 tests. However, note that test expectations can only be reliably shared between
 Python 2 and Python 3 if they only use ASCII characters in their node ids: this
 likely isnâ€™t a limitation if tests are using the normal Python format, as
 Python 2 only allows ASCII characters in identifiers.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 version of pytest-expect
