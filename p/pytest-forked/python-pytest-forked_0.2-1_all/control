Description: py.test plugin for running tests in isolated forked subprocesses
 The pytest-forked plugin extends py.test by adding an option to run tests in
 isolated forked subprocesses. This is useful if you have tests involving C or
 C++ libraries that might crash the process. To use the plugin, simply use the
 --forked argument when invoking py.test.
