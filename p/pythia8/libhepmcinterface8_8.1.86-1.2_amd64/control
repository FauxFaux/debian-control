Description: HepMC interface for PYTHIA8 (obsolete)
 PYTHIA is a program for the generation of high-energy physics events, i.e.
 for the description of collisions at high energies between elementary
 particles such as e+, e-, p and pbar in various combinations. It contains
 theory and models for a number of physics aspects, including hard and soft
 interactions, parton distributions, initial- and final-state parton showers,
 multiple interactions, fragmentation and decay.
 .
 This is a transitional dummy package, HepMC interface has been moved into
 the package 'libpythia8'.
