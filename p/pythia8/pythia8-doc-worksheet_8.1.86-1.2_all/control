Description: Worksheet Documentation of PYTHIA8
 PYTHIA is a program for the generation of high-energy physics events, i.e.
 for the description of collisions at high energies between elementary
 particles such as e+, e-, p and pbar in various combinations. It contains
 theory and models for a number of physics aspects, including hard and soft
 interactions, parton distributions, initial- and final-state parton showers,
 multiple interactions, fragmentation and decay.
 .
 The Worksheet of PYTHIA8 teachs you the basics of how to use the PYTHIA 8.1
 event generator to study various physics aspects.
