Description: Colossal Cave Adventure game
 Explore Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in treasure and
 gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never seen again.
 .
 Colossal Cave Adventure (originally named “ADVENT” or “Adventure”) is
 the seminal text adventure game, written by Will Crowther and Don
 Woods.
 .
 This is a re-implementation of the “350-point” version, using the
 same game content from the PDP-10 source code of the late 1970s.
 .
 It uses the original text exactly, and emits responses slow enough to
 read as the contemporary terminal interfaces did.
