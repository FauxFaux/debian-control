Description: Artificial Intelligence Markup Language interpreter for Python
 PyAIML is an interpreter for AIML, the Artificial Intelligence Markup
 Language, implemented as a 100% pure standard Python package.
 .
 The package is fully compliant with the AIML 1.0.1 standard: no less,
 but also no more.  PyAIML's focus is (and will remain) bare-bones AIML
 interpreting. That means no support for obscure communication protocols,
 no advanced non-standard features, and no user interface to speak of.
