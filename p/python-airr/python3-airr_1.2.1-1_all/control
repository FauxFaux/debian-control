Description: Data Representation Standard library for antibody and TCR sequences
 This package provides a library by the AIRR community to for describing,
 reporting, storing, and sharing adaptive immune receptor repertoire
 (AIRR) data, such as sequences of antibodies and T cell receptors
 (TCRs). Some specific efforts include:
  * The MiAIRR standard for describing minimal information about AIRR
    datasets, including sample collection and data processing information.
  * Data representations (file format) specifications for storing large
    amounts of annotated AIRR data.
  * APIs for exposing a common interface to repositories/databases
    containing AIRR data.
  * A community standard for software tools which will allow conforming
    tools to gain community recognition.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
