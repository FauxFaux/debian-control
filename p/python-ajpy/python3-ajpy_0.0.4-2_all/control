Description: Python module to craft AJP requests
 AJPy is a small Python module that allows one to craft and serialize AJP
 packets in order to communicate with AJP connectors from a Python
 application. This pentesting oriented library can be used to test the
 resistance of AJP connectors (e.g. Apache Tomcat), but also for a variety of
 server tests.
