Description: OpenStack Alarming as a Service - Python 2.7 client
 Aodh provides alarming for OpenStack. The alarming component of Aodh, first
 delivered in the Havana version, allows you to set alarms based on threshold
 evaluation for a collection of samples. An alarm can be set on a single meter,
 or on a combination. For example, you may want to trigger an alarm when the
 memory consumption reaches 70% on a given instance if the instance has been up
 for more than 10 min.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.7 module.
