Description: another Python SQLite 3 wrapper (debug extension)
 APSW (Another Python SQLite Wrapper) is an SQLite 3 wrapper that
 provides the thinnest layer over SQLite 3 possible. Everything you
 can do from the C API to SQLite 3, you can do from Python. Although
 APSW's API looks vaguely similar to Python's DB-API, it is not
 compliant with that API and instead works the way SQLite 3 does.
 .
 This package contains the extension built for the Python debug interpreter.
