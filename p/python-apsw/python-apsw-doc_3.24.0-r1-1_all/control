Description: documentation for python-apsw
 APSW (Another Python SQLite Wrapper) is an SQLite 3 wrapper that
 provides the thinnest layer over SQLite 3 possible. Everything you
 can do from the C API to SQLite 3, you can do from Python. Although
 APSW's API looks vaguely similar to Python's DB-API, it is not
 compliant with that API and instead works the way SQLite 3 does.
 .
 This package contains the documentation.
