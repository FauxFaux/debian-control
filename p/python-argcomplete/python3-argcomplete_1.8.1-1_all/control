Description: bash tab completion for argparse (for Python 3)
 Argcomplete provides easy, extensible command line tab completion of
 arguments for your Python script.
 .
 It makes two assumptions:
 .
  * You're using bash as your shell
  * You're using argparse to manage your command line arguments/options
 .
 Argcomplete is particularly useful if your program has lots of
 options or subparsers, and if your program can dynamically suggest
 completions for your argument/option values (for example, if the user
 is browsing resources over the network).
 .
 This package provides the module for Python 3.x.
