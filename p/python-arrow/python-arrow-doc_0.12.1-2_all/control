Description: Python library to manipulate dates, times, timestamps: documentation
 A Python library that offers a sensible, human-friendly approach to creating,
 manipulating, formatting and converting dates, times, and timestamps.
 It implements and updates the datetime type, plugging gaps in functionality,
 and provides a module API that supports many common creation scenarios.
 Arrow replaces a number of modules: datetime, time, calendar, dateutil, pytz.
 This is a documentation package.
