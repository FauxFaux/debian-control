Description: Python 3 library for the Advanced Scientific Data Format
 ASDF (Advanced Scientific Data Format) is a proposed
 next generation interchange format for scientific data. ASDF aims to
 exist in the same middle ground that made FITS so successful, by
 being a hybrid text and binary format: containing human editable
 metadata for interchange, and raw binary data that is fast to load
 and use. Unlike FITS, the metadata is highly structured and is
 designed up-front for extensibility.
 .
 This is the Python 3 package.
