Description: Redis-py backend for ASGI, with built-in sharding (Python3 version)
 An ASGI channel layer that uses Redis as its backing store, and supports both a
 single-server and sharded configurations, as well as group support.
 .
 A "local and remote" mode is also supported, where the Redis channel layer
 works in conjunction with a machine-local channel layer (asgi_ipc) in order to
 route all normal channels over the local layer, while routing all single-reader
 and process-specific channels over the Redis layer.
 .
 "Sentinel" mode is also supported, where the Redis channel layer will connect
 to a redis sentinel cluster to find the present Redis master before writing or
 reading data.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the library.
