Description: Atomic file writes - PyPy
 It uses a temporary file in the same directory as the given path. This ensures
 that the temporary file resides on the same filesystem.
 The temporary file will then be atomically moved to the target location: On
 POSIX, it will use rename if files should be overwritten, otherwise a
 combination of link and unlink.
 .
 This package contains the PyPy.
