Description: Python object database
 Divmod Axiom is an object database, or alternatively, an
 object-relational mapper, implemented on top of Python.
 .
 Its primary goal is to provide an object-oriented layer with the key
 aspects of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), i.e. polymorphism and
 message dispatch, without hindering the power of an RDBMS (Relational
 DataBase Management System).
 .
 Axiom is a live database, not only an SQL generation tool: it includes
 an implementation of a scheduler service, external file references,
 automatic upgrades, robust failure handling, and Twisted integration.
 .
 Axiom is tightly integrated with Twisted, and can store, start, and
 stop Twisted services directly from the database using the included
 'axiomatic' command-line tool.
 .
 Note: Axiom currently supports only SQLite and does NOT have any
 features for dealing with concurrency.
