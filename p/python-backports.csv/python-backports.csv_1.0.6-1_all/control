Description: Backport of the Python 3 CSV module for Python 2
 The API of the csv module in Python 2 is drastically different from the csv
 module in Python 3. This is due, for the most part, to the difference
 between str in Python 2 and Python 3.
 .
 The semantics of Python 3's version are more useful because they support
 unicode natively, while Python 2's csv does not.
