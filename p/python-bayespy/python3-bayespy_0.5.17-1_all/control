Description: variational Bayesian inference tools for Python
 BayesPy provides tools for Bayesian inference with Python. The user constructs
 a model as a Bayesian network, observes data and runs posterior inference. The
 goal is to provide a tool which is efficient, flexible and extendable enough
 for expert use but also accessible for more casual users.
 .
 This package provides the modules for Python 3
