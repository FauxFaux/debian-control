Description: Thin, practical wrapper around terminal capabilities in Python3
 Blessed is a thin, practical wrapper around terminal capabilities in
 Python. It provides:
 .
  * Styles, color, and maybe a little positioning without necessarily
    clearing the whole screen first.
  * Works great with standard Python string formatting.
  * Provides up-to-the-moment terminal height and width, so you can
    respond to terminal size changes.
  * Avoids making a mess if the output gets piped to a non-terminal:
    outputs to any file-like object such as StringIO, files, or pipes.
  * Uses the terminfo(5) database so it works with any terminal type and
    supports any terminal capability: No more C-like calls to tigetstr
    and tparm.
  * Keeps a minimum of internal state, so you can feel free to mix and
    match with calls to curses or whatever other terminal libraries you
    like.
  * Provides plenty of context managers to safely express terminal modes,
    automatically restoring the terminal to a safe state on exit.
  * Act intelligently when somebody redirects your output to a file,
    omitting all of the terminal sequences such as styling, colors, or
    positioning.  Dead-simple keyboard handling: safely decoding unicode
    input in your system's preferred locale and supports
    application/arrow keys.
  * Allows the printable length of strings containing sequences to be
    determined.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
