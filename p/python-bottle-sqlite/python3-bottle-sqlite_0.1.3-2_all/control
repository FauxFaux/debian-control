Description: SQLite3 integration for Bottle - Python 3.x
 Bottle-sqlite is a plugin that integrates SQLite3 with your Bottle
 application. It automatically connects to a database at the beginning of a
 request, passes the database handle to the route callback and closes the
 connection afterwards.
 .
 To automatically detect routes that need a database connection, the plugin
 searches for route callbacks that require a `db` keyword argument
 (configurable) and skips routes that do not. This removes any overhead for
 routes that don't need a database connection.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3.x module.
