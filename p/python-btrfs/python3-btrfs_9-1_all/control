Description: python module to inspect btrfs filesystems
 Currently, the primary goal of this module is to be able to inspect the
 internals of an existing filesystem for educational purposes.
 .
 A second goal is to provide a nicer way for automating administration tasks
 and writing monitoring scripts by being able to just programmatically access
 the needed information, instead of having to spend most of the time on parsing
 human readable output from other btrfs tools.
