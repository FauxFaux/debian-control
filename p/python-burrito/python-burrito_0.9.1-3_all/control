Description: Python 2 framework for wrapping and controlling command-line applications
 burrito, canonically pronounced boar-eee-toe, is a Python framework for
 wrapping and controlling command-line applications.
 .
 This tool allows developers to wrap command-line applications, just as burritos
 wrap delicious foods. Both hide the potentially unsightly details.
 .
 burrito is derived from the application controller framework code, which was
 originally added to PyCogent and later moved to scikit-bio.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2 modules.
