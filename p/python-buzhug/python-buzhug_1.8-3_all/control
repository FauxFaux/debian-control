Description: pure-Python database engine, using a Pythonic, no-SQL syntax
 Buzhug is a fast, pure-Python database engine, using a syntax that Python
 programmers should find very intuitive.
 .
 The data is stored and accessed on disk (it is not an in-memory database);
 the implementation has been designed to make all operations, and especially
 selection, as fast as possible with an interpreted language.
 .
 The database is implemented as a Python iterator, yielding objects whose
 attributes are the fields defined when the base is created ; therefore,
 requests can be expressed as list comprehensions or generator expressions,
 instead of SQL queries.
Python-Version: 2.7
