Description: Handle CAN (Controller Area Network) descriptions - cmdline utilities
 Canmatrix implements a "Python CAN Matrix Object" which describes the
 CAN-communication itself and some auxiliary objects (Boardunits, Frames,
 Signals, Values, ...)
 Canmatrix also includes two Tools (canconvert and cancompare) for
 converting and comparing CAN databases. There are also some extract and merge
 options for dealing with CAN databases.
