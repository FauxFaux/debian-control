Description: AMQP messaging queue framework
 AMQP is the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol, an open standard protocol
 for message orientation, queuing, routing, reliability and security.
 .
 The aim of carrot is to make messaging in Python as easy as possible by
 providing a high-level interface for producing and consuming messages.
 At the same time it is a goal to re-use what is already available as much
 as possible.
 .
 carrot has pluggable messaging back-ends, so it is possible to support
 several messaging systems. Currently, there is support for AMQP (py-amqplib)
 and STOMP (python-stomp). There is also a in-memory backend for testing
 purposes that uses the Python queue module.
