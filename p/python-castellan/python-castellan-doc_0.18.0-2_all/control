Description: generic key manager interface for OpenStack - doc
 The Castellan module provides a generic key manager interface so that
 OpenStack projects can use Barbican, but also have the flexibilty to choose an
 alternative Key Manager as needed. This is helpful during development, for
 example, where a simple implementation of the Key Manager Interface can be
 used instead of having to spin up a Barbican instance.
