Description: Python3 Implementation of RFC 7049. Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)
 CBOR is comparable to JSON, has a superset of JSON’s ability, but serializes
 to a binary format which is smaller and faster to generate and parse.
 .
 The two primary functions are cbor.loads() and cbor.dumps(). This library
 includes a C implementation which runs 3-5 times faster than the Python
 standard library’s C-accelerated implementanion of JSON. This is also includes
 a 100% Python implementation
