Description: CLI Application Framework (Documentation)
 Cement is an advanced CLI Application Framework for Python. Its goal is to
 introduce a standard, and feature-full platform for both simple and complex
 command line applications as well as support rapid development needs without
 sacrificing quality. Cement is flexible, and itâ€™s use cases span from the
 simplicity of a micro-framework to the complexity of a mega-framework.
 .
 Features include:
  * Core pieces of the framework are customizable via handlers/interfaces
  * Extension handler interface to easily extend framework functionality
  * Config handler supports parsing multiple config files into one config
  * Argument handler parses command line arguments and merges with config
  * Log handler supports console and file logging
  * Plugin handler provides an interface to easily extend your application
  * Hook support adds a bit of magic to apps and also ties into framework
  * Handler system connects implementation classes with Interfaces
  * Output handler interface renders return dictionaries to console
  * Cache handler interface adds caching support for improved performance
  * Controller handler supports sub-commands, and nested controllers
 .
