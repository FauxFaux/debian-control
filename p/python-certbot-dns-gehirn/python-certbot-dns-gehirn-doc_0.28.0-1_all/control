Description: Documentation for the Gehirn DNS plugin for Certbot
 The objective of Certbot, Let's Encrypt, and the ACME (Automated

 to set up an HTTPS server and have it automatically obtain a
 browser-trusted certificate, without any human intervention. This is
 accomplished by running a certificate management agent on the web
 server.
 .
 This package contains the documentation for the Gehirn DNS plugin to
 the main application.
