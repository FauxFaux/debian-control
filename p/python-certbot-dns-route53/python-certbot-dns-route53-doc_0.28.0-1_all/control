Description: Documentation for the Route53 DNS plugin for Certbot
 The objective of Certbot, Let's Encrypt, and the ACME (Automated
 Certificate Management Environment) protocol is to make it possible
 to set up an HTTPS server and have it automatically obtain a
 browser-trusted certificate, without any human intervention. This is
 accomplished by running a certificate management agent on the web
 server.
 .
 This package contains the documentation for the Route53 DNS plugin to
 the main application.
