Description: root certificates for validating SSL certs and verifying TLS hosts
 Certifi is a carefully curated collection of Root Certificates for
 validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying
 the identity of TLS hosts. It has been extracted from the Requests
 project.
 .
 The version of certifi in this Debian package is patched to return
 the location of Debian-provided CA certificates, instead of those
 packaged by upstream.
