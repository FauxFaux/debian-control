Description: interactive plotting application toolkit
 Chaco is a Python plotting application toolkit and a part of
 Enthought Tool Suite. It is meant to facilitate writing plotting
 applications of all levels of complexity, from simple scripts with
 hard-coded data to large plotting programs with complex data
 interrelationships and a multitude of interactive tools. While Chaco
 generates nice static plots for publication and presentation
 purposes, its components are all designed to be work well for
 interactive data visualization.
