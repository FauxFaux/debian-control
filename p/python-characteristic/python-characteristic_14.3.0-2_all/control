Description: helper for implementing attribute-related object protocols (Python 2)
 characteristic is Python package with class decorators that ease the chores
 of implementing the most common attribute-related object protocols.
 .
 You just specify the attributes to work with and characteristic gives you:
 .
   - a nice human-readable __repr__,
   - a complete set of comparison methods,
   - and a kwargs-based initializer (that cooperates with your existing one)
 .
 without writing dull boilerplate code again and again.
