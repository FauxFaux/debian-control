Description: Logging integration for Click - Python 3.x
 Partly because Python’s logging module aims to be so generic, it doesn’t come
 with sensible defaults for CLI applications. At some point you might also want
 to expose more logging levels through more options, at which point the
 boilerplate code grows even more.
 This is where click-log comes in.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x module.
