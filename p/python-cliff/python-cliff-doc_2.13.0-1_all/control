Description: command line interface formulation framework documentation
 Cliff is a framework for building command line programs. It uses plugins to
 define sub-commands, output formatters, and other extensions.
 .
 The cliff framework is meant to be used to create multi-level commands such as
 Subversion and git, where the main program handles some basic argument parsing
 and then invokes a sub-command to do the work.
 .
 This is the documentation of python-cliff.
