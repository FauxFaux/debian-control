Description: framework for genomic biology
 PyCogent is a software library for genomic biology. It is a fully
 integrated and thoroughly tested framework for:
  * controlling third-party applications,
  * devising workflows; querying databases,
  * conducting novel probabilistic analyses of biological sequence
    evolution, and
  * generating publication quality graphics.
 It is distinguished by many unique built-in capabilities (such as true codon
 alignment) and the frequent addition of entirely new methods for the analysis
 of genomic data.
