Description: formatter to use with the logging module of Python 3
 python-colorlog allows colors to be placed in the format string, which is
 mostly useful when paired with a StreamHandler that is outputting to a
 terminal. This is accomplished by adding a set of terminal color codes to the
 record before it is used to format the string.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version.
