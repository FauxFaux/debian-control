Description: Abstracts common color math operations (Python 3 version)
 python-colormath is a simple Python module that spares the user from directly
 dealing with color math. Some features include: Support for a wide range of
 color spaces. A good chunk of the CIE spaces, RGB, HSL/HSV, CMY/CMYK, and many
 more. Conversions between the various color spaces. For example, XYZ to sRGB,
 Spectral to XYZ, CIE Lab to Adobe RGB. Calculation of color difference. All
 CIE Delta E functions, plus CMC. Chromatic adaptations (changing illuminants).
 RGB to hex and vice-versa. 16-bit RGB support.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the library.
