Description: Python library for building configuration shells - Python 3
 The configshell-fb package is a Python library that provides a
 framework for building simple but nice CLI-based applications.
 .
 The configshell-fb package is a fork of the "configshell" code
 written by RisingTide Systems. The "-fb" differentiates between the
 original and this version. Please ensure to use either all "fb"
 versions of the targetcli components -- targetcli, rtslib, and
 configshell, or stick with all non-fb versions, since they are no
 longer strictly compatible.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 module.
