Description: code coverage tool for Python 2 PyPy
 Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs.
 It monitors your program, noting which parts of the code have been
 executed, then analyzes the source to identify code that could have
 been executed but was not.
 .
 Coverage measurement is typically used to gauge the effectiveness of
 tests. It can show which parts of your code are being exercised by
 tests, and which are not.
 .
 This package installs the Python 2 ‘coverage’ library built for PyPy, and the
 ‘pypy-coverage’ program to perform and report coverage tests.
