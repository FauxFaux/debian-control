Description: Control pipeline recipes from the European Southern Observatory
 This module can list, configure and execute CPL-based recipes from Python3.
 The input, calibration and output data can be specified as FITS files
 or as astropy fits objects in memory.
 .
 The Common Pipeline Library (CPL) comprises a set of ISO-C libraries that
 provide a comprehensive, efficient and robust software toolkit. It forms a
 basis for the creation of automated astronomical data-reduction tasks.
 .
 One of the features provided by the CPL is the ability to create
 data-reduction algorithms that run as plugins (dynamic libraries). These are
 called "recipes" and are one of the main aspects of the CPL data-reduction
 development environment.
