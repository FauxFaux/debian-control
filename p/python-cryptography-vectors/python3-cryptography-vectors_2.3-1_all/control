Description: Test vectors for python-cryptography (Python 3)
 The test vectors for the cryptography library are rather large; thus, they are
 broken out into their own package so that users who do not need to run the
 tests do not need to download and install them.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of cryptography_vectors.
