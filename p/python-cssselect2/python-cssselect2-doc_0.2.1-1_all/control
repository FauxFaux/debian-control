Description: implementation of CSS3 Selectors (Documentation)
 cssselect2 is a straightforward implementation of CSS3 Selectors for markup
 documents (HTML, XML, etc.) that can be read by ElementTree-like parsers
 (including cElementTree, lxml, html5lib, etc.)
 .
 Unlike cssselect, it does not translate selectors to XPath and therefore does
 not have all the correctness corner cases that are hard or impossible to fix in
 cssselect.
 .
 This package contains the documentation.
