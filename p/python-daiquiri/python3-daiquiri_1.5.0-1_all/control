Description: Python library to easily setup basic logging functionality
 The daiquiri library provides an easy way to configure logging. It also
 provides some custom formatters and handlers.
 .
 Its promise is to setup a complete standard Python logging system with just
 one function call. Nothing more, nothing less. The interesting features are:
 .
  * Logs to stderr by default.
  * Uses colors if logging to a terminal.
  * File-based logging.
  * Uses program name as the name of the logging file (so providing just a
    directory for logging will work).
  * syslog & journald support.
  * JSON output.
  * Arbitrary key/value context information providing.
  * Capture the warnings emitted by the warnings module.
  * Native logging of any exception.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version of the package.
