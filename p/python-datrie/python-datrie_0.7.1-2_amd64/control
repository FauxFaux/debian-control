Description: Super-fast, efficiently stored Trie for Python
 trie variable is a dict-like object that can have unicode keys of certain
 ranges and Python objects as values.
 .
 In addition to implementing the mapping interface, tries facilitate finding
 the items for a given prefix, and vice versa, finding the items whose keys are
 prefixes of a given string. As a common special case, finding the
 longest-prefix item is also supported.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 2.
