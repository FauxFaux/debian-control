Description: Small framework for asynchronous programming (Python 2)
 The defer module provides an easy way to write asynchrouns Python programs.
 It is greatly inspired by Twisted's defer, but hasn't got any external
 dependencies.
 .
 Furthermore it features decorators to write asynchronous D-Bus servers and
 clients.
 .
 At first defer was part of aptdaemon, but moved to a separate project in
 August of 2010.
