Description: DendroPy Phylogenetic Computing Library (Python 3)
 DendroPy is a Python library for phylogenetic computing. It provides
 classes and functions for the simulation, processing, and manipulation
 of phylogenetic trees and character matrices, and supports the reading
 and writing of phylogenetic data in a range of formats, such as NEXUS,
 NEWICK, NeXML, Phylip, FASTA, etc. Application scripts for performing
 some useful phylogenetic operations, such as data conversion and tree
 posterior distribution summarization, are also distributed and installed
 as part of the library. DendroPy can thus function as a stand-alone
 library for phylogenetics, a component of more complex multi-library
 phyloinformatic pipelines, or as a scripting “glue” that assembles and
 drives such pipelines.
 .
 This package provides python3 modules.
