Description: Phylogenetic Tree Summarization and Annotation
 SumTrees is a program to summarize non-parameteric bootstrap or
 Bayesian posterior probability support for splits or clades on
 phylogenetic trees.
 .
 The basis of the support assessment is typically given by a set of
 non-parametric bootstrap replicate tree samples produced by programs
 such as GARLI or RAxML, or by a set of MCMC tree samples produced by
 programs such as Mr. Bayes or BEAST. The proportion of trees out of the
 samples in which a particular split is found is taken to be the degree
 of support for that split as indicated by the samples. The samples that
 are the basis of the support can be distributed across multiple files,
 and a burn-in option allows for an initial number of trees in each file
 to be excluded from the analysis if they are not considered to be drawn
 from the true support distribution.
