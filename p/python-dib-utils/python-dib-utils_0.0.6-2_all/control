Description: Standalone tools related to diskimage-builder - Python 2.x
 These tools were originally part of the diskimage-builder project, but they
 have uses outside of that project as well. Because disk space is at a premium
 in base cloud images, pulling in all of diskimage-builder and its dependencies
 just to use something like dib-run-parts is not desirable. This project allows
 consumers to use the tools while pulling in only one small package with few/no
 additional dependencies.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x module.
