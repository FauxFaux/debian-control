Description: robust algorithms for synchronizing plain text (Python 2 module)
 The Diff Match and Patch libraries offer robust algorithms to perform the
 operations required for synchronizing plain text.
 .
  * Diff: Compare two blocks of plain text and efficiently return a list of
    differences.
  * Match: Given a search string, find its best fuzzy match in a block of plain
    text. Weighted for both accuracy and location.
  * Patch: Apply a list of patches onto plain text. Use best-effort to apply
    patch even when the underlying text doesn't match.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2 version of the module.
