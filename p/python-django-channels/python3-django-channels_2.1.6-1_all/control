Description: Developer-friendly asynchrony for Django (Python3 version)
 Channels is a project to make Django able to handle more than just plain HTTP
 requests, including WebSockets and HTTP2, as well as the ability to run code
 after a response has been sent for things like thumbnailing or background
 calculation.
 .
 Itâ€™s an easy-to-understand extension of the Django view model, and easy to
 integrate and deploy.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the library.
