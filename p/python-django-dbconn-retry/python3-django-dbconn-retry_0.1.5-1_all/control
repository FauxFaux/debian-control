Description: reconnect on a failed database (Python3 version)
 This library monkeypatches django.db.backends.base.BaseDatabaseWrapper so that
 when a database operation fails because the underlying TCP connection was
 already closed, it first tried to reconnect, instead of immediately raising an
 OperationException.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the library.
