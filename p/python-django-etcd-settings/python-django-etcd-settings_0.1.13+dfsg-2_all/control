Description: config manager for Django apps based on ETCD (Python2 version)
 This application allows you to extend the Django settings as configured in the
 settings.py file with:
 .
  * Environment dependent values
  * Values in different config sets, identified by name, which can be selected
    on a 'per request' basis using the X-DYNAMIC-SETTINGS HTTP header
 .
 Both the added configuration values and config sets would live at ETCD,
 which will be continuously monitored by this library in order to
 transparently update your app settings upon changes.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 version of the library.
