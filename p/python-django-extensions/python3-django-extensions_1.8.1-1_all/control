Description: Useful extensions for Django projects (Python 3 version)
 This is a collection of useful third-party tools for projects that use the
 Django web development framework. It provides the management commands:
 .
  * runserver_plus - a "runserver" that uses the interactive Werkzeug debugger
  * runprofileserver - starts runserver with profiling tools enabled
  * shell_plus - similar to the built-in "shell" but autoloads all models
  * graph_models - creates a GraphViz dot file of your model arrangement
  * describe_form - generate template form definitions for a model
  * export_emails - export the addresses of your users in many formats
  * print_user_for_session - print the user information from a session key
  * create_jobs/runjob/runjobs - manage scheduled maintenance jobs
  * (plus many more)
 .
 python-django-extensions also includes a number of custom fields and abstract
 models, including ones that manage created and updated times automatically.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the library.
