Description: set of high-level abstractions for Django forms - Python 3.x
 Django's formtools is a set of high-level abstractions for Django forms.
 Currently for form previews and multi-step forms.
 .
 This code used to live in Django proper: in django.contrib.formtools. But it
 was separated into a standalone package in Django 1.8 to keep the framework's
 core clean.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x module.
