Description: Automated image processing for Django (Documentation)
 ImageKit is a Django app for processing images. Need a thumbnail? A
 black-and-white version of a user-uploaded image? ImageKit will make them for
 you. If you need to programmatically generate one image from another, you need
 ImageKit.
 .
 ImageKit comes with a bunch of image processors for common tasks like resizing
 and cropping, but you can also create your own.
 .
 This package contains the documentation.
