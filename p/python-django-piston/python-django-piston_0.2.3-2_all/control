Description: Django mini-framework creating RESTful APIs
 Piston is a relatively small Django application that lets you
 create application programming interfaces (API) for your sites.
 .
 It has several unique features:
 .
    * Ties into Django's internal mechanisms.
    * Supports OAuth out of the box (as well as Basic/Digest or custom auth).
    * Doesn't require tying to models, allowing arbitrary resources.
    * Speaks JSON, YAML, Python Pickle & XML (and HATEOAS).
    * Ships with a convenient reusable library in Python.
    * Respects and encourages proper use of HTTP (status codes, ...).
    * Has built in (optional) form validation (via Django), throttling, etc.
    * Supports streaming, with a small memory footprint.
    * Stays out of your way.
