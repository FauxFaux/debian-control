Description: User-registration application for Django (Python 2)
 This is a fairly simple user-registration application for Django,
 designed to make allowing user signups as painless as possible.
 .
 Its main feature over Django's standard user-registration application is
 the support of email confirmation.
 .
 This application enables a fairly common workflow for user signups:
  1. User signs up for an account.
  2. User gets emailed an activation link.
  3. User clicks the activation link before it expires.
  4. User becomes a happy and productive contributor to your site.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 version of the library.
