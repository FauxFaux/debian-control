Description: Eases the translation process of your Django projects
 A Django application that eases the translation process of your Django
 projects.
 .
 Because it doesn't export any models, Rosetta doesn't create any tables
 in your project's database. Rosetta can be installed and uninstalled by
 simply adding and removing a single entry in your project's INSTALLED_APPS
 and a single line in your main urls.py file.
 .
 Features:
  * Database independent
  * Reads and writes your project's gettext catalogs (po and mo files)
  * Installed and uninstalled in under a minute
  * Uses Django's admin interface CSS
  * Translation suggestions via Google AJAX Language API
 .
 Acknowledgments:
  * Rosetta uses the excellent polib library to parse and handle Po files.
