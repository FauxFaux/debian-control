Description: object-level permissions for Django (Python3 version)
 rules is a tiny but powerful app providing object-level permissions to Django,
 without requiring a database. At its core, it is a generic framework for
 building rule-based systems, similar to decision trees. It can also be used as
 a standalone library in other contexts and frameworks.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the library.
