Description: caching front-end based on the Dogpile lock - Python 3.x
 A caching API built around the concept of a "dogpile lock", which allows
 continued access to an expiring data value while a single thread generates a
 new value.
 .
 dogpile.cache builds on the dogpile.core locking system
 (see http://pypi.python.org/pypi/dogpile.core), which implements the idea of
 "allow one creator to write while others read" in the abstract. Overall,
 dogpile.cache is intended as a replacement to the Beaker (see
 http://beaker.groovie.org) caching system, the internals of which are written
 by the same author. All the ideas of Beaker which "work" are re-implemented in
 dogpile.cache in a more efficient and succinct manner, and all the cruft
 (Beaker's internals were first written in 2005) relegated to the trash heap.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3.x module.
