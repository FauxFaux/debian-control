Description: Python 2 implementation of the Double Ratchet algorithm
 This python library offers an implementation of the Double Ratchet
 algorithm as specified here.
 .
 The goal is to provide a configurable and independent implementation of
 the algorithm, while keeping the structure close to the specification
 and providing recommended settings.
 .
 This library was developed as part of python-omemo, a pretty cool
 end-to-end encryption protocol.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2.7 module.
