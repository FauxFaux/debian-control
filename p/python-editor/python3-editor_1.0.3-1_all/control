Description: programmatically open an editor, capture the result - Python 3.x
 python-editor is a library that provides the editor module for
 programmatically interfacing with your system's $EDITOR. The user can then
 enter a commit message for example.
 .
 Editor first looks for the  environment variable.  If set, it uses
 the value as-is, without fallbacks. If no $EDITOR is set, editor will search
 through a list of known editors, and use the first one that exists on the
 system. For example, on Linux, editor will look for the following editors in
 order:
  * vim
  * emacs
  * nano
 .
 When calling the edit() function, editor will open the editor in a
 subprocess, inheriting the parent process's stdin, stdout
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x module.
