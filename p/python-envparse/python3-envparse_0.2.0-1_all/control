Description: environment variable parsing (Python 3)
 This package contains a simple utility to parse environment variables.
 os.environ is a great choice to start off with but over time you'll find
 yourself duplicating quite a bit of code around handling raw environment
 variables. envparse aims to eliminate this duplicated, often inconsistent
 parsing code and instead provide a single, easy-to-use wrapper.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
