Description: Regular expression acceleration in Python3
 esmre is a Python module that can be used to speed up the execution of a large
 collection of regular expressions. It works by building a index of compulsory
 substrings from a collection of regular expressions, which it uses to quickly
 exclude those expressions which trivially do not match each input.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version of the package.
