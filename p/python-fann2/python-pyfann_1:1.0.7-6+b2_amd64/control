Description: deprecated Python bindings for FANN
 Fast Artificial Neural Network Library is a free open source neural network
 library, which implements multilayer artificial neural networks in C with
 support for both fully connected and sparsely connected networks.
 .
 This package provides the Python bindings for FANN under their former name
 "pyfann". However, these are deprecated, and you should migrate your code
 to use the bindings from python-fann2 instead.
