Description: Quantitative X-Ray Fluorescence Analysis Support Library - (Common)
 This software library implements formulas to calculate, given an
 experimental setup, the expected x-ray fluorescence intensities. The
 library accounts for secondary and tertiary excitation, K, L and M
 shell emission lines and de-excitation cascade effects. The basic
 implementation is written in C++ and a Python binding is provided.
