Description: Python 3 library to read from and write to FITS files
 Fitsio provides an easy to use object-oriented API including
 providing a Numpy interface to FITS files read from CFITSIO. It
 allows direct access to the columns of a FITS binary table which can
 be useful for reading large fits files. Compared to astropy.io.fits,
 this package is closer to the underlying cfitsio library.
 .
 Fitsio also exposes a microlanguage (implemented in CFITSIO) for
 making efficient SQL-like queries of tables (single tables only
 thoughâ€“no joins or anything like that).
 .
 This is the Python 3 package.
