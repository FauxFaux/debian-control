Description: PyUnit extension for defining test fixtures outside of test cases - Python 3.x
 A PyUnit extension for defining test fixtures outside of test cases. Each
 fixture encapsulates creating, reusing and freeing some state - be that a
 temporary directory on disk, SQL server connection, or just a particular
 object graph. This is extremely useful for testing and general resource
 management.
 .
 Fixtures ships with the base class, unittest glue and a number of precanned
 concrete fixtures.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3.x module.
