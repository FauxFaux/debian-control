Description: Plugin for nose or py.test that automatically reruns flaky tests (PyPy)
 Flaky is a plugin for nose or py.test that automatically reruns flaky tests.
 .
 Ideally, tests reliably pass or fail, but sometimes test fixtures must rely on
 components that aren't 100% reliable. With flaky, instead of removing those
 tests or marking them to @skip, they can be automatically retried.
 .
 This package contains the PyPy version of flaky.
