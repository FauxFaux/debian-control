Description: Python fluid dynamics and engineering design library
 Fluids is open-source software for engineers and technicians working in
 the fields of chemical, mechanical, or civil engineering. It includes
 modules for piping, fittings, pumps, tanks, compressible flow,
 open-channel flow, and more.
 .
 The fluids library depends on the SciPy library to provide numerical
 constants, interpolation, integration, and numerical solving functionality.
