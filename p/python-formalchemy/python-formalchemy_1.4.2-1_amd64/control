Description: HTML input form fields from your SQLAlchemy mapped classes
 FormAlchemy greatly speeds development with SQLAlchemy mapped classes (models)
 in a HTML forms environment.
 .
 FormAlchemy eliminates boilerplate by autogenerating HTML input fields from a
 given model. FormAlchemy will try to figure out what kind of HTML code should
 be returned by introspecting the model's properties and generate ready-to-use
 HTML code that will fit the developer's application.
 .
 Of course, FormAlchemy can't figure out everything, i.e, the developer might
 want to display only a few columns from the given model. Thus, FormAlchemy is
 also highly customizable.
