Description: simple Python interface to FUSE (Python 2)
 fusepy is a Python module that provides a simple interface to FUSE and
 MacFUSE. It's just one file and is implemented using ctypes.
 Due to a name clash with the existing API-incompatible python-fuse package,
 the importable module name for fusepy in Debian is 'fusepy' instead of
 upstream's 'fuse'.
 .
 This package installs the Python 2 version.
