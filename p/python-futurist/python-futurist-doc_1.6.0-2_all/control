Description: useful additions to futures, from the future - doc
 Code from the future, delivered to you in the now. For example:
  * A futurist.GreenThreadPoolExecutor using eventlet green thread pools. It
    provides a standard executor API/interface and it also gathers execution
    statistics.
  * A futurist.ProcessPoolExecutor derivative that gathers execution
    statistics.
  * A futurist.SynchronousExecutor that doesnâ€™t run concurrently. It has the
    same executor API/interface and it also gathers execution statistics.
  * A futurist.ThreadPoolExecutor derivative that gathers execution statistics.
  * A futurist.periodics.PeriodicWorker that can use the previously mentioned
    executors to run asynchronous work periodically in parallel or
    synchronously.
  * etc.
 .
