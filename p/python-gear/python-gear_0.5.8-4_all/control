Description: Pure Python Async Gear Protocol Library - Python 2.x
 python-gear is a pure-Python asynchronous library to interface with Gearman.
 .
 It provides interfaces to build a client or worker, and access to the
 administrative protocol. The design approach is to keep it simple, with a
 relatively thin abstration of the Gearman protocol itself. It should be easy
 to use to build a client or worker that operates either synchronously or
 asynchronously.
 .
 The module also provides a simple Gearman server for use as a convenience in
 unit tests. The server is not designed for production use under load.
 .
 Installing the suggested python-statsd package would add support for reporting
 to statsd a frontend to Graphite a stats collection and graphing server.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x module.
