Description: Python3 tools for geographic data
 GeoPandas is a project to add support for geographic data to
 pandas objects.  It currently implements
 `GeoSeries` and `GeoDataFrame` types which are subclasses of
 `pandas.Series` and `pandas.DataFrame` respectively.  GeoPandas
 objects can act on shapely  geometry objects and perform geometric operations.
 .
 GeoPandas geometry operations are cartesian.  The coordinate reference
 system (crs) can be stored as an attribute on an object, and is
 automatically set when loading from a file.  Objects may be
 transformed to new coordinate systems with the `to_crs()` method.
 There is currently no enforcement of like coordinates for operations,
 but that may change in the future.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the library.
