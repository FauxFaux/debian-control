Description: Interpolation of geographic tiepoints in Python
 Python-geotiepoints is a Python module that interpolates (and extrapolates
 if needed) geographical tiepoints into a larger geographical grid.
 This is useful when the full resolution lon/lat grid is needed while only
 a lower resolution grid of tiepoints was provided.
 .
 Some helper functions are provided to accommodate for satellite data, but
 the package should be generic enough to be used for any kind of data.
 .
 In addition python-geotiepoints provides a fast multilinear interpolation
 of regular gridded data using Cython.
