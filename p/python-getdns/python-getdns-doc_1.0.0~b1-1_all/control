Description: modern asynchronous DNS API (documentation)
 getdns is a modern asynchronous DNS API.  It implements DNS entry
 points from a design developed and vetted by application developers,
 in an API specification edited by Paul Hoffman.  With the development
 of this API, we intend to offer application developers a modernized
 and flexible way to access DNS security (DNSSEC) and other powerful
 new DNS features; a particular hope is to inspire application
 developers towards innovative security solutions in their
 applications.

 This package contains documentation for the python bindings.
