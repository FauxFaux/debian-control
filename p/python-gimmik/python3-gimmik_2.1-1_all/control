Description: generator of matrix multiplication kernels (Python 3)
 GiMMiK is a Python based kernel generator for matrix multiplication kernels
 for various accelerator platforms. For small operator matrices the generated
 kernels are capable of outperfoming the state-of-the-art general matrix
 multiplication routines such as cuBLAS GEMM or clBLAS GEMM.
 .
 This package provides the library for Python 3.
