Description: OpenStack Image Service store library - common files
 The Glance project provides services for discovering, registering, and
 retrieving virtual machine images over the cloud. They may be stand-alone
 services, or may be used to deliver images from object stores, such as
 OpenStack's Swift service, to Nova's compute nodes.
 .
 This package contains shared configuration files for the Glance's stores.
