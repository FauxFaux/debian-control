Description: Client library for Openstack glance server - doc
 The Glance project provides services for discovering, registering, and
 retrieving virtual machine images over the cloud. They may be stand-alone
 services, or may be used to deliver images from object stores, such as
 OpenStack's Swift service, to Nova's compute nodes.
 .
 This is a client for the Glance which uses the OpenStack Image API. There's a
 Python API (the "glanceclient" module), and a command-line script ("glance").
 .
 This package provides the documentation and man page.
