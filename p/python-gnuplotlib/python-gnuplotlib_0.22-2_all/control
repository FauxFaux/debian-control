Description: Gnuplot-based plotter for numpy
 gnuplotlib allows numpy data to be plotted using Gnuplot as a backend. As much
 as was possible, this module acts as a passive pass-through to Gnuplot, thus
 making available the full power and flexibility of the Gnuplot backend.

 This is the package for Python2
