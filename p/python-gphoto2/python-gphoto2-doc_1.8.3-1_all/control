Description: Python interface to libgphoto2 (common documentation)
 Python-gphoto2 is a comprehensive Python interface (or binding) to
 libgphoto2. It is built using SWIG to automatically generate the
 interface code. This gives direct access to nearly all the libgphoto2
 functions, but sometimes in a rather un-Pythonic manner.
 .
 This is the common documentation package.
