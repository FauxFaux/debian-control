Description: library for working with graphs in Python (Python3)
 This software provides a suitable data structure for representing graphs and a
 whole set of important algorithms.
 .
 Provided features and algorithms:
 .
  * Support for directed, undirected, weighted and non-weighted graphs
  * Support for hypergraphs
  * Canonical operations
  * XML import and export
  * DOT-Language output (for usage with Graphviz)
  * Random graph generation
 .
  * Accessibility (transitive closure)
  * Breadth-first search
  * Critical path algorithm
  * Cut-vertex and cut-edge identification
  * Cycle detection
  * Depth-first search
  * Heuristic search (A* algorithm)
  * Identification of connected components
  * Minimum spanning tree (Prim's algorithm)
  * Mutual-accessibility (strongly connected components)
  * Shortest path search (Dijkstra's algorithm)
  * Topological sorting
  * Transitive edge identification
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of pygraph.
