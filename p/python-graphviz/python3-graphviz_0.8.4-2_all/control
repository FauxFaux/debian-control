Description: Simple Python 3 interface for Graphviz
 This package facilitates the creation and rendering of graph descriptions in
 the DOT language of the Graphviz graph drawing software from Python.
 .
 Create a graph object, assemble the graph by adding nodes and edges, and
 retrieve its DOT source code string. Save the source code to a file and render
 it with the Graphviz installation of your system.
 .
 Use the ``view`` option/method to directly inspect the resulting (PDF, PNG,
 SVG, etc.) file with its default application. Graphs can also be rendered
 and displayed within Jupyter notebooks.
 .
 This contains the Python 3 version.
