Description: redis protocol reader for Python using hiredis
 This package provides a Python extension that wraps the protocol parsing
 code in Hiredis. It is targeted at speeding up parsing multi bulk replies from
 redis-server.
 .
 Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database, a
 persistent key-value database with support for atomically manipulating and
 querying data structures such as lists and sets.
 .
 Note that it is not a stand-alone redis client library and requires other
 code to perform low-level I/O with redis.
