Description: HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF)
 This module implements the HMAC Key Derivation function, defined at
 http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-krawczyk-hkdf-01
 .
 There are two interfaces: a functional interface, with separate
 extract and expand functions as defined in the draft RFC, and a
 wrapper class for these functions.
