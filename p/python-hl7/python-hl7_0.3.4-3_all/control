Description: Python library for parsing HL7 messages
 HL7 is a communication protocol and message format for health care data.
 It is the de-facto standard for transmitting data between clinical
 information systems and between clinical devices. The version 2.x series,
 which is often is a pipe delimited format is currently the most widely
 accepted version of HL7 (version 3.0 is an XML-based format).
 python-hl7 currently only parses HL7 version 2.x messages into an easy
 to access, list-based, data structure.
