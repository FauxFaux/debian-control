Description: HTTP client mock - Python 3.x
 Once upon a time a Python developer wanted to use a RESTful API, everything
 was fine but until the day he needed to test the code that hits the RESTful
 API: what if the API server is down? What if its content has changed ?
 .
 Don't worry, HTTPretty is here for you.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3.x module.
