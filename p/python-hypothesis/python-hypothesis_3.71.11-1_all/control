Description: advanced Quickcheck style testing library for Python 2
 Hypothesis is a library for testing your Python code against a much
 larger range of examples than you would ever want to write by
 hand. It's based on the Haskell library, Quickcheck, and is designed
 to integrate seamlessly into your existing Python unit testing work
 flow.
 .
 Hypothesis is both extremely practical and also advances the state of
 the art of unit testing by some way. It's easy to use, stable, and
 extremely powerful. If you're not using Hypothesis to test your
 project then you're missing out.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 module.
