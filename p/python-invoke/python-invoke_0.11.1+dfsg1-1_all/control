Description: Pythonic task execution - Python 2.x
 Invoke is a Python (2.6+ and 3.2+) task execution tool and library, drawing
 inspiration from various sources to arrive at a powerful and clean feature
 set.
 .
 Like Ruby's Rake tool and Invoke's own predecessor Fabric 1.x, it provides a
 clean, high level API for running shell commands and defining/organizing task
 functions from a tasks.py file.
 .
 From GNU Make, it inherits an emphasis on minimal boilerplate for common
 patterns and the ability to run multiple tasks in a single invocation.
 .
 Following the lead of most Unix CLI applications, it offers a traditional
 flag-based style of command-line parsing, deriving flag names and value types
 from task signatures.
 .
 Like many of its predecessors, it offers advanced features as well:
 namespacing, task aliasing, before/after hooks, parallel execution and more.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x module.
