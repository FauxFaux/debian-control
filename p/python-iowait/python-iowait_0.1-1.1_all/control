Description: Platform-independent module for I/O completion events
 Different operating systems provide different ways to wait for I/O completion
 events: there's select(), poll(), epoll() and kqueue(). For cross-platform
 applications it can be a pain to support all this system functions, especially
 because each one provides a different interface.
 .
 IOWait solves this problem by providing a unified interface and using always
 the best and faster function available in the platform. Its only limitation is
 that, on Windows, it only works for sockets.
Python-Version: 2.6, 2.7
