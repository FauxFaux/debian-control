Description: Backport of Python 3 ipaddress module (PyPy)
 This module is a backport of the stdlib "ipaddress" module from Python 3. The
 "ipaddress" module is in turn based off of the "ipaddr" module available in
 the "python-ipaddr" but there are some important API differences; make sure
 you are using the right module.
 .
 This package contains the PyPy module.
