Description: Various helpers to pass trusted data to untrusted environment - doc
 itsdangerous provides a module that is a port of the django signing
 module.  It's not directly copied but some changes were applied to
 make it work better on its own.
 .
 itsdangerous allows web applications to use a key only it knows to
 cryptographically sign data and hand it over to someone else (e.g. a
 user).  When it gets the data back it can easily ensure that nobody
 tampered with it.
 .
 This package provides the documentation.
