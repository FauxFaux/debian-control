Description: autocompletion tool for Python
 Jedi is an autocompletion tool for Python. It works. With and without syntax
 errors. Sometimes it sucks, but that's normal in dynamic languages. But it
 sucks less than other tools. It understands almost all of the basic Python
 syntax elements including many builtins.
