Description: Binding the worlds of Java and Python (for Python 3)
 JPype is an effort to allow Python programs full access to java class
 libraries. This is achieved not through re-implementing Python, as
 Jython/JPython has done, but rather through interfacing at the native
 level in both Virtual Machines.
 .
 Eventually, it should be possible to replace Java with Python in many,
 though not all, situations. JSP, Servlets, RMI servers and IDE plugins
 are good candidates.
 .
 This package for Python 3.
