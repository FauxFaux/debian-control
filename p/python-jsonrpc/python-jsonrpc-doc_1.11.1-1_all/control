Description: documentation for json-rpc
 JSON-RPC is a stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol.
 Primarily this specification defines several data structures and the rules
 around their processing. It is transport agnostic in that the concepts can be
 used within the same process, over sockets, over http, or in many various
 message passing environments. It uses JSON (RFC 4627) as data format.
 .
 This package provides the documentation.
