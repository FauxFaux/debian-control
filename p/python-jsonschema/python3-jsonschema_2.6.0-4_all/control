Description: An(other) implementation of JSON Schema (Draft 3 and 4) - Python 3.x
 JSON Schema is a specification for a JSON-based format for defining
 the structure of JSON data. JSON Schema provides a contract for what
 JSON data is required for a given application and how it can be
 modified, much like what XML Schema provides for XML. JSON Schema is
 intended to provide validation, documentation, and interaction control
 of JSON data.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x module.
