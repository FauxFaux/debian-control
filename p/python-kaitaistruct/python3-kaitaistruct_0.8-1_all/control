Description: Kaitai Struct declarative parser generator for binary data (python3)
 This library implements Kaitai Struct API for Python.
 .
 Kaitai Struct is a declarative language used for describe various
 binary data structures, laid out in files or in memory: i.e. binary
 file formats, network stream packet formats, etc.
 .
 It is similar to Python's construct and Construct3, but it is
 language-agnostic. The format description is done in YAML-based .ksy
 format, which then can be compiled into a wide range of target
 languages.
 .
 This is the Python3 package.
