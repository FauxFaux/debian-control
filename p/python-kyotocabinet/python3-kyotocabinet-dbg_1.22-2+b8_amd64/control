Description: Straightforward implementation of DBM - Python 3 debuggin symbols
 Kyoto Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The
 database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of
 a key and a value. Every key and value is serial bytes with variable
 length. Both binary data and character string can be used as a key and
 a value. Each key must be unique within a database. There is neither
 concept of data tables nor data types. Records are organized in
 hash table or B+ tree.
 .
 This package provides the debugging symbols for the Python 3 interface to
 Kyoto Cabinet.
