Description: Mozilla Web localization framework (Python 2)
 L20n is a localization framework developed by Mozilla for the Web. It
 allows localizers to put small bits of logic into localization resources
 to codify the grammar of the language.
 .
 L20n's framework removes the need for developers to thoroughly understand
 the specifics of a natural language and provides an opportunity for
 localizers to create better translations.
 .
 This package includes the l20n modules for Python 2.
