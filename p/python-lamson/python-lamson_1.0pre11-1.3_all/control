Description: A pure Python SMTP server
 Lamson is a pure Python SMTP server designed to create robust and
 complex mail applications in the style of modern web frameworks such as
 Django. Unlike traditional SMTP servers like Postfix or Sendmail,
 Lamson has all the features of a web application stack (ORM, templates,
 routing, handlers, state machines, Python) without needing to configure
 alias files, run newaliases, or juggle tons of tiny fragile processes.
 Lamson also plays well with other web frameworks and Python libraries.
