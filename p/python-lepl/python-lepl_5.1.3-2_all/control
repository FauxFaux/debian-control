Description: recursive descent parser library
 A recursive descent parser for Python 2.6+ (including 3!). Lepl is powerful,
 simple to use, and easy to extend: grammars are written directly as Python
 code, using a syntax similar to BNF; new matchers can be simple functions.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.
