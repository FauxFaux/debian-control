Description: extension for computing string similarities and edit distances(debug extension)
 The Levenshtein module computes Levenshtein distances, similarity ratios,
 generalized medians and set medians of Unicode or non-Unicode strings.
 Because it's implemented in C, it's much faster than the corresponding
 Python library functions and methods.
 .
 The Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of single-character
 insertions, deletions, and substitutions to transform one string into
 another.
 .
 It is useful for spell checking, or fuzzy matching of gettext messages.
 .
 This package contains the extensions built for the Python debug interpreter.
