Description: Python 3 wrapper for libevdev
 This is a Python wrapper around libevdev, a wrapper library for evdev
 devices. It provides a simpler API around evdev and takes advantage
 of libevdevâ€™s advanced event handling, providing
 .
  * access to the state of the device (not just the events)
  * correct handling of fake multitouch devices
  * synchronisation of slots and per-slot state
  * transparent generation of missing tracking ids
  * per-context event handling
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
