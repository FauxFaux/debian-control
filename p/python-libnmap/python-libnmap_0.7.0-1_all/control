Description: Python 2 NMAP library
 This package contains a Python library enabling Python developers to
 manipulate nmap process and data:
    * automate or schedule nmap scans on a regular basis
    * manipulate nmap scans results to do reporting
    * compare and diff nmap scans to generate graphs
    * batch process scan reports
    * ...
 The lib currently offers the following modules:
    * process: enables you to launch nmap scans
    * parse: enables you to parse nmap reports or scan results (only XML so
      far) from a file, a string,…
    * report: enables you to manipulate a parsed scan result and de/serialize
      scan results in a json format
    * diff: enables you to see what changed between two scans
    * common: contains basic nmap objects like NmapHost and NmapService. It is
      to note that each object can be “diff()ed” with another similar object.
    * plugins: enables you to support datastores for your scan results directly
      in the “NmapReport” object. from report module:
        * mongodb: insert/get/getAll/delete
        * sqlalchemy: insert/get/getAll/delete
        * aws s3: insert/get/getAll/delete (not supported for Python3 since boto
          is not supporting py3)
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 2.
