Description: Python 3 bindings for the libtrace API
 python-libtrace (plt) is a Python module that allows you to work with
 packet trace data using WAND's libtrace library.
 .
 It's intended to provide a clean, simple, Python-like way of working
 with libtrace, rather than a simple translation of the libtrace calls
 from C into Python. For example for the protocol header decodes, the
 field names from the RFCs are used rather than libtrace's names.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 bindings.
