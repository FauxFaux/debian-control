Description: Python bindings for the low-level FUSE API (documentation)
 Python-llfuse is a set of Python bindings for the low level FUSE API.
 This package provides the documentation for both the Python 2 and
 Python 3 extension (packages python-llfuse and python3-llfuse).
 .
 FUSE (Filesystem in USErspace) is a simple interface for userspace
 programs to export a virtual filesystem to the Linux kernel. FUSE
 also aims to provide a secure method for non privileged users to
 create and mount their own filesystem implementations.
