Description: file locking library for Python — Python 3 library
 The ‘lockfile’ library exports a ‘LockFile’ class which provides a
 simple API for locking files.
 .
 The appropriate implementation for ‘LockFile’ is chosen automatically
 based on the OS capabilities for an atomic filesystem operation.
 These implementations are also available for explicit use as
 ‘LinkLockFile’ and ‘MkdirLockFile’.
 .
 Other back ends are possible with the same semantics. Examples
 included are:
  * ‘SQLiteLockFile’, using records in an SQLite database.
  * ‘PIDLockFile’, using the semantics of a Unix PID file.
 .
 Unlike other Python locking libraries (the Windows ‘msvcrt.locking’
 function, the Unix ‘fcntl.flock’, ‘fcntl.lockf’, and the deprecated
 ‘posixfile’ module), the API is identical across both Unix (including
 GNU/Linux and MacOS) and Windows platforms.
 .
 This package installs the Python 3 library.
