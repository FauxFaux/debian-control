Description: handlers for the Python standard library's logging package - Python 2.x
 The logutils package provides a set of handlers for the Python standard
 library's logging package.
 .
 Some of these handlers are out-of-scope for the standard library, and so they
 are packaged here. Others are updated versions which have appeared in recent
 Python releases, but are usable with older versions of Python and so are
 packaged here.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x module.
