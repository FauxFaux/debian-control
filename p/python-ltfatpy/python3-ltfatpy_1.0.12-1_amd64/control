Description: Large Time-Frequency Toolbox (LTFAT) in Python
 The ltfatpy package is a partial Python port of the Large Time/Frequency
 Analysis Toolbox (LTFAT), a MATLABÂ®/Octave toolbox for working with
 time-frequency analysis and synthesis.
 .
 It is intended both as an educational and a computational tool.
 .
 The package provides a large number of linear transforms including Gabor
 transforms along with routines for constructing windows (filter prototypes)
 and routines for manipulating coefficients.
 .
 This package provides the modules for Python 3.
