Description: Python wrapper around LuaJIT or Lua (Python3 version)
 Lupa integrates the runtimes of Lua or LuaJIT2 into CPython. It is a partial
 rewrite of LunaticPython in Cython with some additional features such as proper
 coroutine support.
 .
 Features:
  * separate Lua runtime states through a LuaRuntime class
  * Python coroutine wrapper for Lua coroutines
  * iteration support for Python objects in Lua and Lua objects in Python
  * proper encoding and decoding of strings (configurable per runtime, UTF-8 by
    default)
  * frees the GIL and supports threading in separate runtimes when calling into
    Lua
  * written for LuaJIT2, but also works with the normal Lua interpreter
  * easy to hack on and extend as it is written in Cython, not C
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the library.
