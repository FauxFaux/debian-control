Description: Python interface to the lz4 compression library (Python 3)
 This package provides bindings for the liblz4 compression library.
 .
 LZ4 is a very fast lossless compression algorithm, providing compression
 speed at 400 MB/s per core, scalable with multi-cores CPU. It also
 features an extremely fast decoder, with speed in multiple GB/s per core,
 typically reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems.
 .
 This package is for Python 3.
