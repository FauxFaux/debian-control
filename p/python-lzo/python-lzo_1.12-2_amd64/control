Description: Python bindings for the LZO data compression library
 This module provides Python bindings for the LZO data compression library.
 .
 LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
 It offers pretty fast compression and *very* fast decompression.
 Decompression requires no memory.
 .
 In addition there are slower compression levels achieving a quite
 competitive compression ratio while still decompressing at
 this very high speed.
