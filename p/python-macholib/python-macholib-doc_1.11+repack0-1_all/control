Description: module for Mach-O header analysis and editing (API documentation)
 This module can be used to analyze and edit Mach-O headers, the executable
 format used by Mac OS X.
 It's typically used as a dependency analysis tool, and also to rewrite dylib
 references in Mach-O headers to be @executable_path relative.
 Though this tool targets a platform specific file format, it is pure Python
 code that is platform and endian independent.
 .
 This package provides the documentation.
