Description: Fast and complete implementation of Markdown in Python3
 Markdown is a text-to-HTML filter; it translates an easy-to-read /
 easy-to-write structured text format into HTML. Markdownâ€™s text format is most
 similar to that of plain text email, and supports features such as headers,
 emphasis, code blocks, blockquotes, and links.
 .
 This is a fast and complete Python3 implementation of the Markdown spec.
