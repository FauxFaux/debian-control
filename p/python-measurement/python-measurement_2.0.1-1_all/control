Description: unit-aware measurement objects (Python2 version)
 Easily use and manipulate unit-aware measurement objects in Python.
 .
 django.contrib.gis.measure has these wonderful Distance objects that can be
 used not only for storing a unit-aware distance measurement, but also for
 converting between different units and adding/subtracting these objects from
 one another.
 .
 This module not only provides those Distance and Area measurement objects
 (courtesy of Django), but also other measurements including Weight, Volume, and
 Temperature.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 version of the library.
