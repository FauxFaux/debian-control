Description: stateful programmatic web browsing
 A library for browsing the web in Python. Mechanize acts like a browser
 allowing you to do web scraping, functional testing of web sites and
 things no one has thought of yet.
 .
 Among other things, mechanize:
  * Follows links
  * Fills in HTML forms
  * Automatically observes robots.txt
  * Has a browser history
 .
 It was modelled after the Perl module WWW::Mechanize.
