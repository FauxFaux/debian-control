Description: Implementation of Bitcoin BIP-0039 (Python 2)
 This BIP describes the implementation of a mnemonic code or mnemonic sentence.
 A group of easy to remember words for the generation of deterministic wallets.

 It consists of two parts: generating the mnenomic, and converting it into a
 binary seed. This seed can be later used to generate deterministic wallets
 using BIP-0032 or similar methods.
