Description: announcement (signal/event) system for Python 3
 Morris is a simple Python library for creating notification mechanism similar
 to Qt signals or C# events. Application developers can create signals with a
 simple decorator (@signal), send signals by calling the decorated method or
 function, connect to and disconnect from signals with signal.connect() and
 signal.disconnect().
 .
 Morris comes with support for writing high-level unit tests using the
 SignalTestCase.{watchSignal,assertSignalFired,assertSignalNotFired}() methods.
 Appropriate ordering constraints on multiple signals can be tested using the
 SignalTestCase.assertSignalOrdering() method.
 .
 This package contains version of the library for Python 3
