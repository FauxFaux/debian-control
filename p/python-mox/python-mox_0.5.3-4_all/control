Description: mock object framework for Python
 Mox is a mock object framework for Python that simplifies the writing of
 unittests.
 .
 Mox will make mock objects for you, so you don't have to create your
 own. It mocks the public/protected interfaces of Python objects. You set
 up your mock objects expected behavior using a domain specific language
 (DSL), which makes it easy to use, understand, and refactor.
 .
 It is based on EasyMock, a Java mock object framework.
