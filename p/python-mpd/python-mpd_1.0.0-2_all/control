Description: Python MPD client library
 Fast MPD (Music Player Daemon) client library written in pure Python.
 It was written to be a replacement for python-mpdclient which is a bit
 outdated and does not perform good in many situations.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of python-mpd2, a fork of the original
 python-mpd.
