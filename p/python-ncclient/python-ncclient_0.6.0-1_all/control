Description: Python library for NETCONF clients (Python 2)
 ncclient is a Python library that facilitates client-side scripting
 and application development around the NETCONF protocol.
 .
 NETCONF (Network Configuration Protocol) provides mechanisms to install,
 manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices. Its operations
 are realized on top of a simple remote procedure call (RPC) layer.
 .
 The NETCONF protocol uses an Extensible Markup Language (XML) based data
 encoding for the configuration data as well as the protocol messages.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2 version of the library.
