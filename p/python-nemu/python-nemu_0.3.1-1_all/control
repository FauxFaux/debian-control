Description: lightweight network emulator embedded in a small python library
 Nemu (Netwok EMUlator) is a small Python library to create emulated networks
 and run and test programs in them.
 .
 Different programs, or copies of the same program, can run in different
 emulated nodes, using only the emulated network to communicate, without ever
 noticing they all run in the same computer.
 .
 Nemu provides a very simple interface to create nodes, connect them arbitrarily
 with virtual interfaces, configure IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and routes, and
 start programs in the nodes. The virtual interfaces also support emulation of
 delays, loss, and reordering of packets, and bandwidth limitations.
 .
 More advanced configurations, like setting up netfilter (iptables) rules,
 starting VPN tunnels, routing daemons, etc, are simply supported by executing
 the appropriate commands in the emulated nodes, exactly as if they were
 executed in real machines in a real network.
 .
 You can even start interactive sessions by opening xterms on different nodes,
 Nemu has special support for forwarding X sessions to the emulated nodes.
Python-Version: 2.7
