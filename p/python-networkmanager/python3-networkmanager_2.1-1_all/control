Description: Python 3 interface to the NetworkManager D-Bus interface
 python-networkmanager wraps NetworkManager's D-Bus interface so you can be
 less verbose when talking to NetworkManager from Python. All interfaces have
 been wrapped in classes, properties are exposed as Python properties and
 function calls are forwarded to the correct interface.
