Description: Python interface and tools for Neuroshare
 The Neuroshare API is a standardized interface to access electrophysiology
 data stored in various different file formats. To do so, it uses format-
 specific shared libraries.
 .
 This package provides a high-level Python interface to the Neuroshare API
 that focuses on convenience for the user and enables access to all available
 metadata and data. The data is returned in NumPy arrays, which provides a
 quick route to further examination and analysis.
 .
 In addition, this package contains the ns2hdf converter tool that converts
 neuroshare-compatible files into the HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format, ver. 5)
 file format.
 .
 This package contains HTML documentation files for python-neuroshare.
