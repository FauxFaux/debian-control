Description: Python 2 / 3 compatibility, like six, but favouring Python 3
 When thou writeth Python, thou shalt write Python 3 and, just for a
 while, ensure that the thing worketh on Python 2.7 and, possibly, even
 2.6.
 .
 Just before Python 2 is finally phased out, thine codebase shall look
 more like 3 than like 2.
 .
 nine facilitates this new point of view. You can write code that is
 as 3ish as possible while still supporting 2.6. Very comfortable for
 writing new projects.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 bindings only.
