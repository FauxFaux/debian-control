Description: test configuration plugin for nosetests
 nose-testconfig is a plugin to the nose test framework which provides a
 faculty for passing test-specific (or test-run specific) configuration data to
 the tests being executed.
 .
 Currently configuration files in the following formats are supported:
   * YAML (via python-yaml)
   * INI (via ConfigParser)
   * Pure Python (via Exec)
   * JSON
 .
 The plugin is meant to be flexible, ergo the support of exec'ing arbitrary
 Python files as configuration files with no checks. The default format is
 assumed to be ConfigParser ini-style format.
 .
 The plugin provides a method of overriding certain parameters from the command
 line (assuming that the main "config" object is a dict) and can easily have
 additional parsers added to it.
 .
 A configuration file may not be provided. In this case, the config object is an
 empty dict. Any command line "overriding" parameters will be added to the dict.
