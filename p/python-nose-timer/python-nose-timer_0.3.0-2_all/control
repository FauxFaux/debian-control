Description: timer plugin for nosetests - Python 2.x
 A timer plugin for nosetests that answers the question: how much time does
 every test take? Run nosetests with the --with-timer flag, and you will see
 a list of the tests and the time spent by each one (in seconds):
 .
  myapp.tests.ABigTestCase.test_the_world_is_running: 56.0010s
  myapp.tests.ABigTestCase.test_the_rest_of_the_galaxy_is_running: 2356.0010s
 .
 It is also possible to list the 10 slowest tests this way:
 .
  nosetests --with-timer --timer-top-n 10
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x module.
