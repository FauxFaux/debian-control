Description: desktop notifications API for Python
 notify2 provides a Python interface to the Freedesktop notifications system,
 which allows programs to display information to the user in an unobtrusive way.
 Notifications are sent over DBus to a notification daemon, which is responsible
 for presenting them to the user.
 .
 notify2 is intended as a replacement for pynotify (package python-notify), and
 its interface is largely copied from there, although it isn't a complete clone.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.
