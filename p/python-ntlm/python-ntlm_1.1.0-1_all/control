Description: Python library that provides NTLM support
 Python library that provides NTLM support, including an authentication handler
 for urllib2 (includes python-ntlm-fixed patch). This package allows Python
 clients running on any operating system to provide NTLM authentication to a
 supporting server. python-ntlm is probably most useful on platforms that are
 not Windows, since on Windows it is possible to take advantage of
 platform-specific NTLM support.
