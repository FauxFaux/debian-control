Description: Convert numbers to words in multiple languages (Python 3)
 This package contains a Python library that converts numbers like ``42`` to
 words like ``forty-two``.  It supports multiple languages and can even
 generate ordinal numbers like ``forty-second`` (although this last feature is
 a bit buggy for some languages at the moment).
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
