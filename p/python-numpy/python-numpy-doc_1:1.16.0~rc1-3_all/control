Description: NumPy documentation
 Numpy contains a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated
 (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran
 code, and useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number
 capabilities.
 .
 Numpy replaces the python-numeric and python-numarray modules which
 are now deprecated and shouldn't be used except to support older
 software.
 .
 This package contains documentation for Numpy and f2py.
