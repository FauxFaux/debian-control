Description: ofxhome.com financial institution lookup REST client (Python 2.7)
 ofxhome is a REST client for the web service provided by ofxhome.com.
 .
 ofxhome.com provides a way to discover the Open Financial Exchange
 (OFX) URLs and financial institution IDs for banks and other
 financial institutions.
 .
 ofxhome is a sort of "DNS" for financial institution OFX URLs and
 IDs.
 .
 This client by itself is not all that useful unless you are coupling
 it with software that needs this lookup capability.
 .
 This package is for Python 2.7.
