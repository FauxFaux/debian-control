Description: Python 2 implementation of the OMEMO protocol
 This python library offers an open implementation of the OMEMO Multi-End
 Message and Object Encryption protocol as specified here.
 .
 Goals of this implementation are:
 .
  * Do not use libsignal but offer a solid alternative to it
  * Stay away from GPL (not possible until we move away from libsignals
    wireformat)
  * Be flexible to changes that might happen to the OMEMO protocol
  * Keep the structure close to the spec
  * Provide the parts of the protocol (X3DH, Double Ratchet) as own
    repositories
 .
 This package provides the Python 2.7 module.
