Description: low level library to parse OpenFlow messages
 If you want to read an OpenFlow packet from an open socket or send a message
 to an OpenFlow switch, this is your best friend. The main features are:
 high performance, latest specification compliance, short learning curve and
 free software license.
 .
 This library is part of Kytos project, a collaborative project between
 SPRACE (from SÃ£o Paulo State University, Unesp) and Caltech (California
 Institute of Technology). python-openflow was developed to be used with
 Kytos controller, but feel free to use this simple and intuitive library
 in another project with another controller.
