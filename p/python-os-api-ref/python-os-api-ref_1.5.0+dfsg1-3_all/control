Description: Sphinx Extensions to support API reference sites in OpenStack - Python 2.7
 This project is a collection of sphinx stanzas that assist in building an API
 Reference site for an OpenStack project in RST. RST is great for unstructured
 English, but displaying semi structured (and repetitive) data in tables is
 not it's strength. This provides tooling to insert semi-structured data
 describing request and response parameters, and turn those into nice tables.
 .
 The project also includes a set of styling (and javascript) that is expected
 to layer on top of an oslosphinx theme base. This provides a nice set of
 collapsing sections for REST methods and javascript controls to expand /
 collapse all sections.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.7 module.
