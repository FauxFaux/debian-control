Description: lib for consuming OpenStack sevice-types-authority data - Python 2.7
 This package provides a Python library for consuming OpenStack
 sevice-types-authority data
 .
 The OpenStack Service Types Authority contains information about official
 OpenStack services and their historical service-type aliases.
 .
 The data is in JSON and the latest data should always be used. This simple
 library exists to allow for easy consumption of the data, along with a
 built-in version of the data to use in case network access is for some reason
 not possible and local caching of the fetched data.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.7 module.
