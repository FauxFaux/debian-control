Description: mostly transparent proxy class for Python 3
 Padme, named after the Star Wars (tm) character, is a library for creating
 proxy objects out of any other Python object.
 .
 The resulting object is as close to mimicking the original as possible. Some
 things are impossible to fake in CPython so those are highlighted below. All
 other operations are silently forwarded to the original.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x version of the library
