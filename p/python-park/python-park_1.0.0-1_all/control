Description: persistent key-value API for Python with ordered traversal of keys
 Park is a persistent key-value API for Python with ordered traversal of
 keys. Both keys and values are binary safe. It's similar in use to
 LevelDB, but has no dependencies outside the Python standard library.
 It is meant to be extremely easy to use and can scale to a few
 gigabytes of data.
