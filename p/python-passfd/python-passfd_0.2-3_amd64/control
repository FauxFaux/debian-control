Description: Python functions to pass file descriptors across UNIX domain
 This simple extension provides two functions to pass and receive file
 descriptors across UNIX domain sockets, using the BSD-4.3+ sendmsg() and
 recvmsg() interfaces.
 .
 Direct bindings to sendmsg and recvmsg are not provided, as the API does
 not map nicely into Python.
 .
 Please note that this only supports BSD-4.3+ style file descriptor
 passing, and was only tested on Linux.
Python-Version: 2.7
