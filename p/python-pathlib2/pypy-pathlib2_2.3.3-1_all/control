Description: Backport of the "pathlib" stdlib module (PyPy)
 The old pathlib module on bitbucket is in bugfix-only mode. The goal of
 pathlib2 is to provide a backport of standard pathlib module which tracks
 the standard library module, so all the newest features of the standard
 pathlib can be used also on older Python versions.
 .
 This package is (obviously) for PyPy.
