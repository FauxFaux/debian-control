Description: utility library for gitignore style pattern matching of file paths (Python 3)
 pathspec is a utility library for pattern matching of file paths.
 So far this only includes Git's wildmatch pattern matching which itself is
 derived from Rsync's wildmatch. Git uses wildmatch for its gitignore files.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
