Description: Easy build, distribution and deployment scripting in Python
 Paver is a Python-based build/distribution/deployment scripting tool along
 the lines of Make or Rake. What makes Paver unique is its integration with
 commonly used Python libraries. Common tasks that were easy before remain
 easy. More importantly, dealing with your applications specific needs and
 requirements is also easy
 .
 It is not designed to handle the dependency tracking requirements of, for
 example, a C program. It is designed to help out with all of your other
 repetitive tasks (run documentation generators, moving files about,
 downloading things), all with the convenience of Python's syntax and massive
 library of code.
