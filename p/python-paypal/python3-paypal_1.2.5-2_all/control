Description: PayPal API implementation (Python 3)
 This package implements Paypal's Website Payments Pro NVP API in Python.
 This currently includes Direct Payments (Credit card payments without a PayPal
 Account) and PayPal Express Checkout (Payment via a PayPal account).
 .
 python-paypal does no real validation, doesn't hold hands, and is generally
 only going to handle authentication, http-level stuff, and serializing
 a list of keyword arguments passed to the API methods. You'll need to
 read the official PayPal documentation for what key/values to pass:
 https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
