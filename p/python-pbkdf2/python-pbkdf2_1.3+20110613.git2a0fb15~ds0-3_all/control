Description: Python RSA PKCS#5 v2.0 module (Python 2)
 This module implements the password-based key derivation
 function, PBKDF2, specified in RSA PKCS#5 v2.0.
 .
 PKCS#5 v2.0 Password-Based Key Derivation is a key derivation
 function which is part of the RSA Public Key Cryptography
 Standards series. The provided implementation takes a password
 or a passphrase and a salt value (and optionally a iteration
 count, a digest module, and a MAC module) and provides a file-like
 object from which an arbitrarly-sized key can be read.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.
