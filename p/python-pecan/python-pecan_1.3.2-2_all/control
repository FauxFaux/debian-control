Description: WSGI object-dispatching web framework - Python 2.x
 The Pecan Python module is a WSGI object-dispatching web framework designed to
 be lean and fast with few dependencies. Pecan comes bundled with a lightweight
 WSGI development server based on Python's wsgiref.simpleserver. Pecan
 applications also come with an interactive Python shell which can be used to
 execute expressions in an environment very similar to the one your application
 runs in (using the "pecan shell" command).
 .
 WSGI is the "Web Server Gateway Interface". It defines a simple and universal
 interface between web servers and web applications or frameworks for the
 Python programming language.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x module.
