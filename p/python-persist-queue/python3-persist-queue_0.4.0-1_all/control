Description: thread-safe disk based persistent queue
 persist-queue implements a file-based queue and a serial of
 sqlite3-based queues. The goals is to achieve following
 requirements:
 .
  * Disk-based: each queued item should be stored in disk in
    case of any crash.
  * Thread-safe: can be used by multi-threaded producers and
    multi-threaded consumers.
  * Recoverable: Items can be read after process restart.
  * Green-compatible: can be used in greenlet or eventlet
    environment.
