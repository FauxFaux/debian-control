Description: PGP packet parser library (Python 3)
 python-pgpdump is a Python library for parsing PGP packets as specified in
 RFC2440 and RFC4880. It is derived from pgpdump, a C program published at:
 http://www.mew.org/~kazu/proj/pgpdump/ The intent is to support what people
 actually have to do with PGP packets 95% of the time. This module does not
 aim to be a complete PGP parser, as it currently does not decode every PGP
 packet type. Currently supported things include:
 .
  * Signature packets
  * Public key packets
  * ASCII-armor decoding and CRC check
 .
 A single codebase with dependencies on only the standard Python library is
 compatible across Python 2.7, Python 3.2, and PyPy 1.8.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version of the package.
