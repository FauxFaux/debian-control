Description: picklable reimplementation of Python's itertools for Python 3
 Picklable-itertools is a reimplementation of the Python standard
 library's "itertools", in Python, using picklable iterator objects.

 It is intended as a drop-in replacement in cases where functionality
 from itertools is needed, but serializability has to be maintained.
 .
 This package provides the picklable_itertools Python module for
 Python 3.x.
