Description: AMQP client library for Python 3
 Pika is a pure-Python implementation of the AMQP-0-9-1 protocol that tries to
 stay fairly independent of the underlying network support library. Pika was
 developed primarily for use with RabitMQ, but also works with other
 AMQP-0-9-1 brokers.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version of the library.
