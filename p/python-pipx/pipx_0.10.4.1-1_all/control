Description: execute binaries from Python packages in isolated environments
 pipx allows you to...
 .
  * Run the latest version of a CLI application from a package
    in a temporary virtual environment,
    leaving your system untouched after it finishes.
  * Install packages to isolated virtual environments,
    while globally exposing their CLI applications
    so you can run them from anywhere.
  * Easily list, upgrade, and uninstall packages
    that were installed with pipx.
 .
 pipx runs with regular user permissions,
 never calling "sudo pip install".
