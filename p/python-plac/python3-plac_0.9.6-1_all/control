Description: Smartest command line arguments parser in the world
 Technically plac is just a simple wrapper over argparse which hides most
 of its complexity by using a declarative interface: the argument parser
 is inferred rather than written down by imperatively.
 .
 plac is targetting especially unsophisticated users, programmers,
 sys-admins, scientists and in general people writing throw-away scripts
 for themselves, choosing the command-line isurprisingly scalable upwards,
 even without using the underlying argparse.
