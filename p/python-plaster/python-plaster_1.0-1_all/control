Description: Python multi-format configuration file loader interface - Python 2.x module
 plaster is a loader interface around arbitrary config file formats. It exists
 to define a common API for applications to use when they wish to load
 configuration settings.
 .
 The library itself does not aim to handle anything except a basic API that
 applications may use to find and load configuration settings. Any specific
 constraints should be implemented in a pluggable loader which can be registered
 via an entrypoint.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2 version of the module.
