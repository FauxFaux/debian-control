Description: Library to enforce positional or key-word arguments - doc
 The Positional Python module provides a decorator which enforces only some
 args may be passed positionally. The idea and some of the code was taken from
 the oauth2 client of the google-api client. The decorator makes it easy to
 support Python 3 style key-word only parameters.
