Description: extends Nose with certain TestNG like features - Python 2.x
 Proboscis is a Python test framework that extends Python's built-in unittest
 module and Nose with features from TestNG.
 .
 TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing
 some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use.
 .
 Features:
  * Uses decorators instead of naming conventions.
  * Allows for TestNG style test methods, in which a class is initialized once,
    as an alternative to using class fields.
  * Allows for explicit test dependencies and skipping of dependent tests on
    failures.
  * Runs xUnit style clases if desired or needed for backwards compatibility.
  * Uses Nose if available (but doesn't require it), and works with many of
    its plugins.
  * Runs in IronPython and Jython (although if you're targeting the JVM you
    should consider using TestNG instead).
 .
 This package provides the Python 2.x module.
