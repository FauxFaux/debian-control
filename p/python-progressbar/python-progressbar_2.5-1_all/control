Description: text progress bar library for Python
 A text progress bar is typically used to display the progress of a long
 running operation, providing a visual cue that processing is underway.
 .
 The ProgressBar class manages the current progress, and the format of the line
 is given by a number of widgets. A widget is an object that may display
 differently depending on the state of the progress bar. There are three types
 of widgets:
   - a string, which always shows itself
   - a ProgressBarWidget, which may return a different value every time its
     update method is called
   - a ProgressBarWidgetHFill, which is like ProgressBarWidget, except it
     expands to fill the remaining width of the line.
