Description: Python 2 client for the Prometheus monitoring system
 This library provides an API for exporting metrics from a Python application.
 It provides classes for the metric types, and an HTTP server to expose the
 metrics to Prometheus.
 .
 When using Linux, the process CPU, RAM, file descriptor usage and start time
 will also be exported.
 .
 Along with the HTTP server to expose metrics, you can also write the metrics
 to a text file to be exported by the prometheus-node-exporter, or push them to
 the prometheus-pushgateway.
 .
 This library also includes support for re-exporting Graphite metrics to
 Prometheus, custom collectors to proxy metrics for other systems and a parser
 for the Prometheus text format.
