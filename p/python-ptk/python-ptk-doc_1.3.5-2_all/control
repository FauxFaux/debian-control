Description: parser for Python with support for asynchronous input (documentation)
 PTK implements LR(1) parsing in Python. Compared to compiled tools
 like Bison, it attempts to spare programmer's time. Python sources
 describe both the grammar and the callbacks, avoiding code
 generation.  Various inputs are accepted: Python 3 asynchronous
 streams, PyZipFile archives, Twisted Deferred objects.
