Description: documentation for pydap
 Pydap is an implementation of the Opendap/DODS protocol, written from scratch.
 You can use Pydap to access scientific data on the internet without having to
 download it; instead, you work with special array and iterable objects that
 download data on-the-fly as necessary, saving bandwidth and time. The module
 also comes with a robust-but-lightweight Opendap server, implemented as a WSGI
 application.
 .
 This package provides the documentation.
