Description: lightweight parallel task engine for Python
 pyFlow is a tool to manage tasks in the context of a task dependency
 graph. It has some similarities to make. pyFlow is not a program â€“ it is
 a Python module, and workflows are defined using pyFlow by writing
 regular Python code with the pyFlow API.
