Description: Python library implementing a trie data structure (common documentation)
 Trie data structure, also known as radix or prefix tree, is a tree
 associating keys to values where all the descendants of a node have
 a common prefix (associated with that node).
 .
 The trie module contains Trie, CharTrie and StringTrie classes each
 implementing a mutable mapping interface, i.e. dict interface. As
 such, in most circumstances, Trie could be used as a drop-in
 replacement for a dict, but the prefix nature of the data structure
 is trie's real strength.
 .
 The module also contains PrefixSet class which uses a trie to store
 a set of prefixes such that a key is contained in the set if it or
 its prefix is stored in the set.
 .
 This is the common documentation package.
