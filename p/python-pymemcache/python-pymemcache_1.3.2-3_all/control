 the following features:
  * Complete implementation of the memcached text protocol.
  * Configurable timeouts for socket connect and send/recv calls.
  * Access to the "noreply" flag, which can significantly increase the speed of
    writes.

    misses.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x module.
