 the following features:
  * Complete implementation of the memcached text protocol.
  * Configurable timeouts for socket connect and send/recv calls.
  * Access to the "noreply" flag, which can significantly increase the speed of
    writes.

  * The (optional) ability to treat network and memcached errors as cache
    misses.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x module.
