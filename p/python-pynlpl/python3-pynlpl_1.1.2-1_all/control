Description: PyNLPl is a library for Natural Language Processing (Python 3 version)
 PyNLPl, pronounced as 'pineapple', is a Python library for Natural Language
 Processing. It contains various modules useful for common, and less common,
 NLP tasks. PyNLPl can be used for basic tasks such as the extraction of
 n-grams and frequency lists, and to build simple language models. It also
 contains complex data types and algorithms. Moreover, it includes parsers for
 file formats common in NLP (e.g. FoLiA/Giza/Moses/ARPA/Timbl/CQL) and clients
 to interface with various NLP specific servers. PyNLPl most notably features a
 very extensive library for working with FoLiA XML (Format for Linguistic
 Annotation).
 .
 This is the Python 3 version.
