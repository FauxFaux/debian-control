Description: unified API for parsing NZB files from NNTP (Usenet) servers
 pynzb is a unified API for parsing NZB files, with several concrete
 implementations included.
 .
 NZB is an XML-based file format for retrieving posts from NNTP (Usenet)
 servers.  Since NZB is XML-based, it's relatively easy to build one-off
 parsers to parse NZB files.  This project is an attempt to consolidate those
 many one-off NZB parsers into one simple interface.
 .
 This package includes three implementations (listed in order of
 compatibility): one based on expat, another based on ElementTree, and a final
 implementation based on lxml.  The expat version should work on all versions
 of Python > 2.0.  The ElementTree implementation will work on Python > 2.5.
 The lxml version will work as long as lxml is installed.
 .
 Simply import nzb_parser from the pynzb package.  It's an instantiated
 version of the fastest available parser that your system can support.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3 module.
