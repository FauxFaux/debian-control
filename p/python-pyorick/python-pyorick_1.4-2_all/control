Description: Python 2 module to execute Yorick code
 The pyorick package starts Yorick as a subprocess and provides an
 interface between Python and Yorick interpreted code.
 .
 Features:
  + exec or eval arbitrary Yorick code strings
  + get or set Yorick variables
  + call Yorick functions or subroutines with Python arguments
  + get or set slices of large Yorick arrays
  + terminal mode to interact with Yorick by keyboard through Python
 .
 Most of the data is exchanged via binary pipes between the two
 interpreters. Yorick runs in a request-reply mode. Python prints
 anything Yorick sends to stdout or stderr except prompts.
 .
 This package contains the module for Python 2.
