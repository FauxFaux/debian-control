 Quick overview of using One Time Passwords on your phone
 --------------------------------------------------------
 .
  * OTPs involve a shared secret, stored both on the phone and the server
  * OTPs can be generated on a phone without internet connectivity
  * OTPs should always be used as a second factor of authentication(if your
    phone is lost, you account is still secured with a password)
  * Google Authenticator allows you to store multiple OTP secrets and provision
    those using a QR Code(no more typing in the secret)
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of pyotp.
