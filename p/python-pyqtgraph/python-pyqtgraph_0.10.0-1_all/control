Description: Scientific Graphics and GUI Library for Python 2
 PyQtGraph is a pure-python graphics and GUI library built on PyQt4 and numpy.
 It is intended for use in mathematics / scientific / engineering applications.
 Despite being written entirely in Python, the library is very fast due to its
 heavy leverage of numpy for number crunching and Qt's GraphicsView framework
 for fast display.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.
