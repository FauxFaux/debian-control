Description: python interface to SQLite 3
 pysqlite is an interface to the SQLite database server for
 Python. It aims to be fully compliant with Python database
 API version 2.0 while also exploiting the unique features of
 SQLite.
 .
 pysqlite 1.1.x is built against SQLite 3 but uses the same API as
 pysqlite 1.0.x (for SQLite 2, packaged as python-sqlite). Newer
 interfaces to SQLite 3 can be found in the package python-pysqlite2
 and python-apsw.
