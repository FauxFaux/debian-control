Description: Documentation for python-pysqlite2
 pysqlite is a DB-API 2.0-compliant database interface for SQLite.
 .
 SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a
 relatively small C library. It is a public domain project created
 by D. Richard Hipp. Unlike the usual client-server paradigm, the
 SQLite engine is not a standalone process with which the program
 communicates, but is linked in and thus becomes an integral part
 of the program. The library implements most of SQL-92 standard,
 including transactions, triggers and most of complex queries.
 .
 This package only contains the documentation.
