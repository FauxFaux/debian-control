Description: helper scripts for Variant Call Format (VCF) parser
 The Variant Call Format (VCF) specifies the format of a text file used
 in bioinformatics for storing gene sequence variations. The format has
 been developed with the advent of large-scale genotyping and DNA
 sequencing projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project.
 .
 The intent of this module is to mimic the ``csv`` module in the Python
 stdlib, as opposed to more flexible serialization formats like JSON or
 YAML. ``vcf`` will attempt to parse the content of each record based on
 the data types specified in the meta-information lines -- specifically
 the ##INFO and
 ##FORMAT lines. If these lines are missing or incomplete, it will check
 against the reserved types mentioned in the spec. Failing that, it will
 just return strings.
 .
 This package provides helper scripts using python3-pyvcf.
