Description: implementation of the PEP 3156 event-loop with Qt
 Implementation of asyncio event loop that uses the Qt Event loop,
 as proposed in PEP 3156.
 .
 PEP 3156 is a proposal for asynchronous I/O in Python 3,
 starting at Python 3.3.
 The proposal includes a pluggable event loop, transport
 and protocol abstractions similar to those in Twisted,
 and a higher-level scheduler.
 .
 Qt is a cross-platform application framework
 that is used for developing application software.
