Description: Library for computation of physical quantities with units, based on numpy
 Quantities is designed to handle arithmetic and
 conversions of physical quantities, which have a magnitude, dimensionality
 specified by various units, and possibly an uncertainty.
 Quantities builds on the popular numpy library and is
 designed to work with numpy ufuncs, many of which are already
 supported.
