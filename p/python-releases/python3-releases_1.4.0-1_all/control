Description: Sphinx extension for changelog manipulation (Python 3)
 Releases is a Sphinx extension designed to help you keep a source control
 friendly, merge friendly changelog file & turn it into useful, human readable
 HTML output.
 .
 Specifically:
 .
   * The source format (kept in your Sphinx tree as ``changelog.rst``) is a
     stream-like timeline that plays well with source control & only requires
     one entry per change (even for changes that exist in multiple release
     lines).
   * The output (when you have the extension installed and run your Sphinx
     build command) is a traditional looking changelog page with a section for
     every release; multi-release issues are copied automatically into each
     release.
   * By default, feature and support issues are only displayed under feature
     releases, and bugs are only displayed under bugfix releases. This can be
     overridden on a per-issue basis.
 .
 This package contains the python3.x version of the library
