Description: Python encoding library similar to bittorrent's bencode
 For complex, heterogeneous data structures with many small elements,
 r-encodings take significantly less space than b-encodings.
 This version of rencode is a complete rewrite in Cython in order to
 increase performance over the pure Python module written by Petru Paler,
 Connelly Barnes et al.
