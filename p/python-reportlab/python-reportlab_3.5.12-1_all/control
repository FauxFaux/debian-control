Description: ReportLab library to create PDF documents using Python
 ReportLab is a library that lets you directly create documents in
 Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF) using the Python programming language.
 .
 ReportLab library creates PDF based on graphics commands without
 intervening steps. It's therefore extremely fast, and flexible (since
 you're using a full-blown programming language).
 .
 Sample use cases are:
   * Dynamic PDF generation on the web
   * High-volume corporate reporting and database publishing
   * As embeddable print engine for other applications, including a
     'report language' so that users can customize their own reports.
   * As 'build system' for complex documents with charts, tables and text
     such as management accounts, statistical reports and scientific papers
   * from XML to PDF in one step
Python-Version: 2.7
