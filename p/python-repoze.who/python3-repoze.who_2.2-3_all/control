Description: ident and auth framework for Python WSGI applications - Python 3.x
 repoze.who is an identification and authentication framework for
 arbitrary Python WSGI applications; it acts as WSGI middleware.
 .
 repoze.who is inspired by Zope 2's Pluggable Authentication Service
 (PAS), but is not dependent on Zope in any way; it is useful for any
 WSGI application.
 .
 It provides no facility for authorization (ensuring whether a user
 can or cannot perform the operation implied by the request). This is
 considered to be the domain of the WSGI application.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x module.
