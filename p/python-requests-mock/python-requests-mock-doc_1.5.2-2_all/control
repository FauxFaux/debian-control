Description: mock out responses from the requests package - doc
 requests-mock provides a building block to stub out the HTTP requests_
 portions of your testing code. Everything in requests_ eventually goes through
 an adapter to do the transport work. requests-mock creates a custom adapter
 that allows you to predefine responses when certain URIs are called. There are
 then a number of methods provided to get the adapter used.
