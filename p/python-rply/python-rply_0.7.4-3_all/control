Description: pure Python based parser that also works with RPython (Python 2)
 This package provides a pure Python based parser generator, that also
 works with RPython. It is a more-or-less direct port of David
 Bazzley's awesome PLY, with a new public API, and RPython support.
 .
 This package provides Python 2 bindings only.
