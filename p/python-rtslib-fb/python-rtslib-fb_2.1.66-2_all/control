Description: object API for managing the Linux LIO kernel target - Python 2.x
 The rtslib-fb package is an object-based Python library for configuring the
 LIO generic SCSI target, present in 3.x Linux kernel versions.
 .
 The rtslib-fb package is a fork of the "rtslib" code written by RisingTide
 Systems. The "-fb" differentiates between the original and this version.
 Ensure to use either all "fb" versions of the targetcli components --
 targetcli, rtslib, and configshell, or stick with all non-fb versions,
 since they are no longer strictly compatible.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x module.
