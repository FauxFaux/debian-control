Description: documentation for python-ruffus computation pipeline library
 Ruffus is designed to allow scientific and other analyses to be automated
 with the minimum of fuss and the least effort.
 .
  * Lightweight: Suitable for the simplest of tasks
  * Scalable: Handles even fiendishly complicated pipelines which would cause
    make or scons to go cross-eyed and recursive.
  * Standard Python: No "clever magic", no pre-processing.
  * Unintrusive: Unambitious, lightweight syntax which tries to do this one
    small thing well.
 .
 This package provides modules documentation.
