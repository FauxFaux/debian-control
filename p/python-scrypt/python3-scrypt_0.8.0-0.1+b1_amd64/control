Description: bindings for the scrypt key derivation function library - Python 3.x
 This is a set of Python bindings for the scrypt key derivation function.
 .
 Scrypt is useful when encrypting password as it is possible to specify a
 minimum amount of time to use when encrypting and decrypting. If, for
 example, a password takes 0.05 seconds to verify, a user won't notice the
 slight delay when signing in, but doing a brute force search of several
 billion passwords will take a considerable amount of time. This is in
 contrast to more traditional hash functions such as MD5 or the SHA family
 which can be implemented extremely fast on cheap hardware.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3.x module.
