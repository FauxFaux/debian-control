Description: implementing the SemVer scheme - Python 3.x
 This small Python library provides a few tools to handle SemVer in Python. It
 follows strictly the 2.0.0 version of the SemVer scheme. semantic_version can
 also support versions which wouldn't match the semantic version scheme by
 converting a version such as 0.1.2.3.4 into 0.1.2+3.4.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x module.
