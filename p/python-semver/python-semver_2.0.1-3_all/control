Description: helps to compare semantic versioning - Python 2.x
 This Python module helps to compare versions as noted at http://semver.org/.
 The system is like this: given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment
 the:
  * MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
  * MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible
    manner,
  * PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
 .
 Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as
 extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x module.
