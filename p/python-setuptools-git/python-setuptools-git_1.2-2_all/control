Description: plugin for setuptools that enables git integration
 This is a plugin for setup tools that enables Git integration.  Once
 installed, Setuptools can be told to include in a module distribution
 all the files tracked by git.  This is an alternative to explicit
 inclusion specifications with MANIFEST.in.
 .
 This package was formerly known as gitlsfiles.  The name change is the
 result of an effort by the setuptools plugin developers to provide a
 uniform naming convention.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.
Python-Version: 2.7
