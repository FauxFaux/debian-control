Description: Python subprocess interface
 sh (previously pbs) is a full-fledged subprocess replacement for Python 2.6 -
 3.2 that allows you to call any program as if it were a function:
 .
   from sh import ifconfig
   print ifconfig("eth0")
 .
 sh is not a collection of system commands implemented in Python.
 .
 This package provides Python 2 module bindings only.
