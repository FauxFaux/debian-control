Description: SOAP Support for Python
 This package contains the SOAPpy Python module, which implements a high-
 level interface to Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) functions from
 Python. It includes functionality for acting as a SOAP server, client,
 or proxy, and includes both building and parsing functions. It has been
 tested against a wide array of other SOAP clients and servers, and is a very
 robust and well-rounded implementation of the SOAP protocol.
 .
 SOAPpy is not actively supported by upstream anymore - please do not
 consider to use it in new projects! All functions were merged into ZSI,
 which is available in the python-zsi package, use it instead.
