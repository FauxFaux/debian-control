Description: Python 3.x wrapper for the ssdeep piecewise hashing tool
 This is a straightforward Python wrapper for ssdeep by Jesse Kornblum,
 which is a library for computing context triggered piecewise hashes (CTPH).
 Also called fuzzy hashes, CTPH can match inputs that have homologies.
 Such inputs have sequences of identical bytes in the same order, although
 bytes in between these sequences may be different in both content and length.
 .
 This package contains the extension built for Python 3.x.
