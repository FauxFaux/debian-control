Description: Streaming ETL - Geospatial ETL framework for Python 2
 Stetl, streaming ETL, pronounced "staedl", is a lightweight ETL-framework
 for the conversion of rich (as GML) geospatial data conversion.
 .
 It basically glues together existing parsing and transformation tools
 like GDAL/OGR (ogr2ogr) and XSLT. By using native tools like libxml and
 libxslt (via Python lxml) Stetl is speed-optimized.
 .
 Stetl has a similar design as Spring (Java) and other modern frameworks
 based on IoC (Inversion of Control). A configuration file (in Python
 config format) specifies your chain of ETL steps. This chain is formed
 by a series of Python modules/objects and their parameters. These are
 symbolically specified in the config file. You just invoke etl.py the
 main program with a config file. The config file specifies the input
 modules (e.g. PostGIS), transformers (e.g. XSLT) and outputs (e.g. a GML
 file or even WFS-T a geospatial protocol to publish GML to a server).
 .
 This package contains the module for Python 2.
