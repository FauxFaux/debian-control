Description: utility belt for automated testing - Python 2.x
 Sure is a library for Python that leverages a DSL for writing assertions. In
 CPython it monkey-patches the object type, adding some methods and properties
 purely for test purposes. Any Python code written after "import sure" gains
 testing superpowers.
 .
 This package contains the module for Python 2.x.
