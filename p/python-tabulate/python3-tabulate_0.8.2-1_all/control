Description: pretty-print tabular data in Python3
 Pretty-print tabular data in Python, a library and a command-line utility.
 The main use cases of the library are:
 .
  * printing small tables without hassle: just one function call, formatting is
    guided by the data itself
  * authoring tabular data for lightweight plain-text markup: multiple output
    formats suitable for further editing or transformation
  * readable presentation of mixed textual and numeric data: smart column
    alignment, configurable number formatting, alignment by a decimal point
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3, and the cli tool.
