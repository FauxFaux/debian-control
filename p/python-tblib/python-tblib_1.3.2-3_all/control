Description: Python 2 traceback fiddling library
 This library allows pickling tracebacks so that they can be passed across
 process boundaries.  The traceback objects that come out are stripped of
 some attributes such as variables, but it is at least possible to raise
 exceptions with those tracebacks or print them.
