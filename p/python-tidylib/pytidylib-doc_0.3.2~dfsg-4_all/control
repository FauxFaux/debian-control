Description: Python wrapper for HTML Tidy (tidylib) documentation
 PyTidyLib is a Python package that wraps the HTML Tidy library. This allows
 you, from Python code, to “fix” invalid (X)HTML markup. Some of the library’s
 many capabilities include:
 .
  * Clean up unclosed tags and unescaped characters such as ampersands
  * Output HTML 4 or XHTML, strict or transitional, and add missing doctypes
  * Convert named entities to numeric entities, which can then be used in XML
    documents without an HTML doctype.
  * Clean up HTML from programs such as Word (to an extent)
  * Indent the output, including proper (i.e. no) indenting for pre elements,
    which some (X)HTML indenting code overlooks.
 .
 This package contains the built HTML and PDF documentation for PyTidyLib.
