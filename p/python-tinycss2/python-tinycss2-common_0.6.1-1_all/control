Description: Low-level CSS parser (test data)
 tinycss2 is a rewrite of tinycss with a simpler API, based on the more recent
 CSS Syntax Level 3 specification.
 .
 tinycss2 is low-level in that it doesnâ€™t parse all of CSS: it doesn't know
 about the syntax of any specific properties or at-rules. Instead, it provides a
 set of functions that can be composed to support exactly the parts of CSS
 you're interested in, including new or non-standard rules or properties,
 without modifying tinycss or having a complex hook/plugin system.
 .
 In many cases, parts of the parsed values (such as the content of a AtRule) is
 given as component values that can be parsed further with other functions.
 .
 This package contains the test data of the library.
