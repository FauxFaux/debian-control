Description: small, modular RPC library — Python 2
 ‘tinyrpc’ is a library for making and handling RPC calls in Python.
 .
 Its initial scope is handling JSON-RPC, although it aims to be very
 well-documented and modular to make it easy to add support for
 further protocols.
 .
 A feature is support of multiple transports (or none at all) and
 providing clever syntactic sugar for writing dispatchers.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 2.
