Description: library for Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language - Python 2.7
 This package provides a Python module which parses and emits TOML. TOML aims
 to be a minimal configuration file format that's easy to read due to obvious
 semantics. TOML is designed to map unambiguously to a hash table. TOML should
 be easy to parse into data structures in a wide variety of languages.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.7 module.
