Description: library for XML/JSON RPC using the Tornado framework
 This library is an implementation of both the JSON-RPC and the XML-RPC
 specification (server-side) for the Tornado web framework. It supports the
 basic features of both, as well as the MultiCall / Batch support for both
 specifications. The JSON-RPC handler supports both the original 1.0
 specification, as well as the new (proposed) 2.0 spec, which includes batch
 submission, keyword arguments, etc.
 .
 There is also a base library that other RPC protocols could use to quickly get
 tied into Tornado.
