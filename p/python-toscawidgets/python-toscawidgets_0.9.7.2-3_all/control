Description: Python framework for building reusable web components
 ToscaWidgets is a system for creating re-usable web components, such
 as a popup calendar or a rich text editor.
 .
 In general, components consist of an HTML template, static resources
 (JavaScript, CSS, Images, etc.) and server-side code. ToscaWidgets
 allow these to be packaged into a "widget", that a web developer can
 then easily use in their application.
 .
 This package also provides some contributions for ToscaWidgets, in
 particular:
 .
  * tw.forms - web widgets for building and validating forms
