Description: library for communicating with TREZOR Bitcoin HW wallet (Python 2)
 No matter how unprotected your computer or internet connection might be,

 TREZOR is an isolated environment for offline transaction signing and using
 a small display you can visually verify the transaction contents. That's why
 all operations using TREZOR are entirely safe.
