Description: Pure Python implementation of the trie data structure (Python 3)
 A trie is an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a mapping where
 the keys are sequences, usually strings over an alphabet.
 In addition to implementing the mapping interface, tries allow finding the
 items for a given prefix, and vice versa, finding the items whose keys are
 prefixes of a given key.
 .
 This is the Python 3 package.
