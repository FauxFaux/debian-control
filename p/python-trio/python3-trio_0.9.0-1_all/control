Description: Python async I/O library
 Trio is a Python async I/O library like Twisted or the asyncio standard
 library, but with an API rethink following lessons learned from asyncio and
 Dave Beazley's Curio. The author claims that the resulting design is radically
 simpler than older competitors like asyncio and Twisted, yet just as capable.
 .
 This project is young and still somewhat experimental. The API has not yet
 been declared stable. If you need more mature or with a more stable API,
 then Python's asyncio library, or the older Twisted, are probably better bets.
