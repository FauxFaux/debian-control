Description: Converter of Report Markup Language (RML) file to PDF
 Tiny RML2PDF is a tool to easily create PDF document without programming. It
 can be used as a Python library or as a standalone binary. It converts a RML,
 an XML dialect that lets you define the precise appearance of a printed
 document, to a PDF. You can use your existing tools to generate an input file
 that exactly describes the layout of a printed document, and RML2PDF converts
 it into PDF. RML is a much more powerful and flexible alternative to XSL:FO.
