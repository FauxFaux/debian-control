Description: terminal progress bar and status output for Python
 ttystatus is a Python library for showing progress reporting and status
 updates on terminals, for (Unix) command line programs. Output is
 automatically adapted to the width of the terminal: truncated if it does
 not fit, and re-sized if the terminal size changes.
 .
 Output is provided via widgets. Each widgets formats some data into
 a suitable form for output. It gets the data either via its initializer,
 or from key/value pairs maintained by the master object. The values are
 set by the user. Every time a value is updated, widgets get updated
 (although the terminal is only updated every so often to give user time
 to actually read the output).
 .
 The output from ttystatus goes to the terminal (`/dev/tty`) and is
 restricted to a single line.
