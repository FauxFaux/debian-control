Description: compatibility API between asyncio/Twisted/Trollius - doc
 Txaio is a helper library for writing code that runs unmodified on both
 Twisted and asyncio.
 .
 This is like six , but for wrapping over differences between Twisted and
 asyncio so one can write code that runs unmodified on both (aka "source code
 compatibility"). In other words: users can choose if they want asyncio or
 Twisted as a dependency.
 .
 This package contains the documentation.
