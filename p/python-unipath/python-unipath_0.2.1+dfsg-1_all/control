Description: object-oriented approach to file/pathname manipulations
 Unipath is a package for doing pathname calculations and filesystem
 access in an object-oriented manner, an alternative to functions in
 os.path, shutilm glob, and even some functions in os.* It's based on
 Jason Orendorff's path.py but does not adhere as strictly to the
 underlying functions' syntax, in order to provide more user
 convenience and higher-level functionality.
