Description: utility class for manipulating URLs.
 URLObject is a utility class for manipulating URLs. The latest
 incarnation of this library builds upon the ideas of its
 predecessor, but aims for a clearer API, focusing on proper
 method names over operator overrides. It's also being developed
 from the ground up in a test-driven manner, and has full
 Sphinx documentation.
