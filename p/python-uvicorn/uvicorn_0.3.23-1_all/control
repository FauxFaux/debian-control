Description: ASGI server implementation, using uvloop and httptools
 Uvicorn is a fast ASGI server, built on uvloop and httptools. It currently
 supports HTTP/1.1 and WebSockets.
 .
 Uvicorn is designed with particular attention to connection and resource
 management, in order to provide a robust server implementation. It aims to
 ensure graceful behavior to either server or client errors, and resilience to
 poor client behavior or denial of service attacks.
