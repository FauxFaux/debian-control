Description: library for deferring decorator actions
 Venusian is a library which allows framework authors to defer decorator
 actions. Instead of taking actions when a function (or class) decorator is
 executed at import time, you can defer the action usually taken by the
 decorator until a separate "scan" phase.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version.
