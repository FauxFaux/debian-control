Description: Collection of web-related functions (Python 2)
 Python module with simple, reusable functions to work with URLs, HTML,
 forms, and HTTP, that arenâ€™t found in the Python standard library.
 .
 This module is used to, for example:
  - remove comments, or tags from HTML snippets
  - extract base url from HTML snippets
  - translate entities on HTML strings
  - encoding mulitpart/form-data
  - convert raw HTTP headers to dicts and vice-versa
  - construct HTTP auth header
  - RFC-compliant url joining
  - sanitize urls (like browsers do)
  - extract arguments from urls
 .
 The code of w3lib was originally part of the Scrapy framework but was later
 stripped out of Scrapy, with the aim of make it more reusable and to provide
 a useful library of web functions without depending on Scrapy.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.
