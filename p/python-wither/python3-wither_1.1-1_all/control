Description: XML/HTML Generation DSL (Python 3)
 Wither is a library designed to make XML generation under Python as
 simple and as nicely formatted as Python code.
 .
 Wither is implemented as a thin stateless wrapper around etree.Element
 objects and works by making use of the ‘with’ keyword in Python to build
 a nested tree of etree objects that can be processed with standard
 tools/techniques
 .
 by using Python as a DSL you can automatically ensure that all tags are
 properly closed and also execute arbitrary Python code to build things
 such as lists or to embed widgets
 .
 This package provides the Python 3 version of Wither.
