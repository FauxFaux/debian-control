Description: Python 2 implementation of the X3DH key agreement protocol
 This python library offers an implementation of the Extended Triple
 Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol (X3DH) as specified here.
 .
 The goal is to provide a configurable and independent implementation of
 the protocol, while keeping the structure close to the specification.
 .
 This library was developed as part of python-omemo, a pretty cool
 end-to-end encryption protocol.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2.7 module.
