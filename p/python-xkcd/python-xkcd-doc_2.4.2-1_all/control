Description: Python library for accessing xkcd.com (common documentation)
 This is a Python library for accessing and retrieving links to comics from the
 xkcd webcomic by Randall Munroe. It is NOT endorsed or made by him, it’s an
 entirely independent project.
 .
 It makes use of the JSON interface to Randall’s site to retrieve comic data.
 .
 One can create comic objects manually using Comic(number), or can use the
 helper functions provided- getLatestComic(), getRandomComic(), and getComic()-
 to do this. Once you have a Comic object, you can access data from it using
 various provided methods.
 .
 This is the common documentation package.
