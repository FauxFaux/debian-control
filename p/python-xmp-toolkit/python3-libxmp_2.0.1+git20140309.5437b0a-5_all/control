Description: Python3 library for XMP metadata
 Python XMP Toolkit is a library for working with XMP metadata, as well as
 reading/writing XMP metadata stored in many different file formats.
 .
 XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform) facilitates embedding metadata in files
 using a subset of RDF. Most notably XMP supports embedding metadata in PDF and
 many image formats, though it is designed to support nearly any file type.
 .
 This package provides Python3 bindings.
