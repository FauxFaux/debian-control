Description: Angular JS Cookies XStatic support - Python 3.x
 XStatic is a Python web development tool for handling required static data

 a lightweight infrastructure to manage them via Python modules that your app
 can depend on in a portable, virtualenv-friendly way instead of using embedded
 copies.
