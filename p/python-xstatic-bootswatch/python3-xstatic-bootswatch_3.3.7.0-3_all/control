Description: Bootswatch XStatic support - Python 3.x
 XStatic is a Python web development tool for handling required static data
 files from external projects, such as CSS, images, and JavaScript. It provides
 a lightweight infrastructure to manage them via Python modules that your app
 can depend on in a portable, virtualenv-friendly way instead of using embedded
 copies.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x module support for the Bootswatch.
 See the description of the libjs-bootswatch package.
