Description: implements the saveAs() FileSaver interface - XStatic support
 XStatic is a Python web development tool for handling required static data
 files from external projects, such as CSS, images, and JavaScript. It provides
 a lightweight infrastructure to manage them via Python modules that your app
 can depend on in a portable, virtualenv-friendly way instead of using embedded
 copies.
 .
 FileSaver.js implements the saveAs() FileSaver interface in browsers that do
 not natively support it.
 .
 FileSaver.js is the solution to saving files on the client-side, and is
 perfect for webapps that need to generate files, or for saving sensitive
 information that shouldn't be sent to an external server.
