Description: JavaScript yaml implementation - XStatic support
 XStatic is a Python web development tool for handling required static data
 files from external projects, such as CSS, images, and JavaScript. It provides
 a lightweight infrastructure to manage them via Python modules that your app
 can depend on in a portable, virtualenv-friendly way instead of using embedded
 copies.
 .
 Js-YAML is an implementation of YAML, a human-friendly data serialization
 language. Started as PyYAML port, it was completely rewritten from scratch.
 Now it's very fast, and supports 1.2 spec.
