Description: Magic-Search XStatic support - Python 3.x
 XStatic is a Python web development tool for handling required static data
 files from external projects, such as CSS, images, and JavaScript. It provides
 a lightweight infrastructure to manage them via Python modules that your app
 can depend on in a portable, virtualenv-friendly way instead of using embedded
 copies.
 .
 MagicSearch is an AngularJS directive that provides a UI for both faceted
 filtering and as-you-type filtering. It is intended for filtering tables, such
 as an AngularJS smart-table, but it can be used in any situation where you can
 provide it with facets/options and consume its events.
 .
 MagicSearch was initially developed by David Kavanagh for Eucalyptus.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x module.
