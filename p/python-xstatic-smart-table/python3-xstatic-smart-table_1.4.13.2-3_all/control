Description: AngularJS smart-table (XStatic packaging standard) - Python 3.x
 XStatic is a Python web development tool for handling required static data
 files from external projects, such as CSS, images, and JavaScript. It provides
 a lightweight infrastructure to manage them via Python modules that your app
 can depend on in a portable, virtualenv-friendly way instead of using embedded
 copies.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x module for supporting the smart-table
 javascript library.
