Description: provides a set of testing utilities for the kazoo library - Python 3.x
 Zake is a Python package that works to provide a nice set of testing utilities
 for the kazoo library.
 .
 It includes the following functionality:
  * Storage access (for viewing what was saved/created).
  * Kazoo *mostly* compatible client API.
  * Sync/transaction/create/get/delete... commands.
  * Listener support.
  * And more...
 .
 It simplifies testing by providing a client that has a similar API as the
 kazoo client so that your tests (or applications/libraries that use kazoo) do
 not require a real zookeeper server to be  tested with (since this is not
 available in all testing environments).
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x module.
