Description: OpenStack Zaqar Queueing API, client and library - Python 2.7
 Zaqar is a multi-tenant cloud messaging service for web developers. It
 combines the ideas pioneered by Amazon's SQS product with additional semantics
 to support event broadcasting.
 .
 The service features a fully RESTful API, which developers can use to send
 messages between various components of their SaaS and mobile applications, by
 using a variety of communication patterns. Underlying this API is an efficient
 messaging engine designed with scalability and security in mind.
 .
 Other OpenStack components can integrate with Zaqar to surface events to end
 users and to communicate with guest agents that run in the "over-cloud" layer.
 Cloud operators can leverage Zaqar to provide equivalents of SQS and SNS to
 their customers.
 .
 By installing python-zaqarclient you get programmatic access to the Zaqar v1.0
 API library. Plus, it installs a plugin to python-openstackclient that allows
 you to perform simple queue operations.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.7 module.
