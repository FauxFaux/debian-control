Description: Use Python doctest with other languages
 doctest (and recently manuel) provide hooks for using custom doctest
 parsers. zc.customdoctests helps to leverage this to support other
 languages, such as JavaScript (with python-spidermonkey):
 .
     js> function double (x) {
     ...     return x*2;
     ... }
     js> double(2)
     4
 .
 And with python-manuel, it facilitates doctests that mix multiple languages,
 such as Python, JavaScript, and sh.
