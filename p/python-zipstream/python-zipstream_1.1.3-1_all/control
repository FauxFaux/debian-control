Description: Zipfile generator
 Zipstream.py is a zip archive generator based on python 3.3's zipfile.py.
 .
 It was created to generate a zip file generator for streaming (ie web apps).
 This is beneficial for when you want to provide a downloadable archive of a
 large collection of regular files, which would be infeasible to generate the
 archive prior to downloading.
