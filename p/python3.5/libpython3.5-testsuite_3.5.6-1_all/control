Description: Testsuite for the Python standard library (v3.5)
 The complete testsuite for the Python standard library.  Note that
 a subset is found in the libpython3.5-stdlib package, which should
 be enough for other packages to use (please do not build-depend
 on this package, but file a bug report to include additional
 testsuite files in the libpython3.5-stdlib package).
