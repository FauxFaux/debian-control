Description: wxPython-based GUI construction framework (optional development tools)
 PythonCard is a GUI construction framework for building cross-platform desktop
 applications on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, using the Python language.  It
 is based on the wxPython bindings for the wxWidgets toolkit (formerly known
 as wxWindows).
 .
 This package takes the tools that are part of the PythonCard distribution
 (such as codeEditor and resourceEditor) and makes them available to be called
 from the command-line and from the standard Debian menus.  It has been split
 out as a separate package since only developers will need access to the tools
 directly - packages which depend on PythonCard will just import the tool
 modules and use what they need.
