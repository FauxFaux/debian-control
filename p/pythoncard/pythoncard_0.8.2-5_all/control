Description: wxPython-based GUI construction framework (meta-package)
 PythonCard is a GUI construction framework for building cross-platform desktop
 applications on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, using the Python language.  It
 is based on the wxPython bindings for the wxWidgets toolkit (formerly known
 as wxWindows).
 .
 This is a meta-package which is intended to be used by developers who want the
 entire upstream distribution available to them.  Maintainers of other packages
 that rely on PythonCard functionality should consider depending on one or more
 of the related packages (python-pythoncard, pythoncard-tools) as needed instead
 of this meta-package.
