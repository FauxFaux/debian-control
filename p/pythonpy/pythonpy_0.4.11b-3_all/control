Description: 'python -c', with tab completion and shorthand

 command 'py' evaluates a string consisting of any Python expression. It can do
 anything from simple arithmetic to complex operations, importing modules
 automatically. It also comes with tab completion.

 Its usage is not restricted to single expressions only. There's also the
 possibility to pipe data from stdin and to stdout, even generating strings to
 be evaluated by other programs.
