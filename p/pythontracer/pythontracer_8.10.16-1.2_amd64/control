Description: Python programs' execution tracer and profiler
 Lets you see your Python program's execution as a tree of function
 invocations, each tree node exposing the real time, and CPU time (user/sys)
 of that call.
 .
 This project consists of two main components: A Python tracer that can run
 your Python programs (much like "cProfile" and friends). A Gtk+ based GUI
 that can show the trace results.
 .
 It uses a tiny auxiliary library written for it "graphfile" to allow
 append-only writing and reading static DAG's directly from file without
 reading it whole into memory at any stage.
