Description: Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) for Python3
 The Unicode Collation Algorithm is defined in the Unicode Technical
 Report #10 (UTR-10). It defines a customizable method to compare
 two strings which can be used for the implementation of sorting orders
 for Unicode alphabets.
 .
 This library is a Python implementation of the UCA which provides
 special features for the sorting of non-English Unicode strings like
 multi-level comparison, contraction, and expansion.
 .
 This package provides Pyuca for Python 3.
