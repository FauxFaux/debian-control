Description: Python bindings for ViennaCL linear algebra library (for Python 2)
 The Vienna Computing Library (ViennaCL) is a free open-source
 scientific computing library written in C++ and provides CUDA, OpenCL
 and OpenMP computing backends. It enables simple, high-level access
 to the vast computing resources available on parallel architectures
 such as GPUs and is primarily focused on common linear algebra
 operations (BLAS levels 1, 2 and 3) and the solution of large systems
 of equations by means of iterative methods with optional
 preconditioners.
 .
 This package provides the Python 2 bindings for ViennaCL, PyViennaCL,
 letting you harness the computational power of ViennaCL in the
 context of the Python scientific ecosystem.
