Description: Python WBEM Client and Provider Interface
 PyWBEM is a Python library that implements a Web Based Enterprise
 Management (WBEM) client.  It performs WBEM operations using the
 CIM-XML and CIM Operations over HTTP protocols as defined by the
 Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF).  WBEM is used to remotely
 describe and manage distributed computing environments.  It is a peer
 and perhaps successor to the SNMP protocol.
