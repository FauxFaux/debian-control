Description: Python 2 module for generating PostScript graphics
 PyX is a Python 2 module for generating encapsulated PostScript figures using
 an abstraction of PostScript and TeX.
 .
 The module provides access to PostScript features such as paths,
 line-styles, fill patterns, transformations, and clipping. Geometric
 operations on paths such as intersections, transformations, and splitting
 are also supported.
 .
 PyX also allows flexible graph generation with many different graph and
 axis styles.
 .
 Development of this Python 2 version of PyX has ceased. Use the python3-pyx
 package for a version of PyX compatible with Python 3.
