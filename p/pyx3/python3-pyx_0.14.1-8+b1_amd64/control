Description: Python 3 module for generating PostScript graphics
 PyX is a Python 3 module for generating encapsulated PostScript, PDF and SVG
 figures using an abstraction of PostScript and TeX.
 .
 The module provides access to PostScript features such as paths,
 line-styles, fill patterns, transformations, and clipping. Geometric
 operations on paths such as intersections, transformations, and splitting
 are also supported.
 .
 PyX also allows flexible graph generation with many different graph and
 axis styles.
 .
 Use the python-pyx package for a version of PyX compatible with Python 2.
