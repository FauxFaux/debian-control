Description: Python XML Schema Bindings (SAML bindings for Python3)
 PyXB is a pure Python package that generates Python code for classes that
 correspond to data structures defined by XMLSchema. In concept it is similar to
 JAXB for Java and CodeSynthesis XSD for C++.
 .
 The major goals of PyXB are:
  * Provide a generated Python interface that is “Pythonic”, meaning similar to
    one that would have been hand-written:
    + Attributes and elements are Python properties, with name conflicts
      resolved in favor of elements
    + Elements with maxOccurs larger than 1 are stored as Python lists
    + Bindings for type extensions inherit from the binding for the base type
    + Enumeration constraints are exposed as class (constant) variables
  * Support bi-directional conversion (document to Python and back)
  * Allow easy customization of the generated bindings to provide functionality
    along with content
  * Support all XMLSchema features that are in common use, including:
    + complex content models (nested all/choice/sequence)
    + cross-namespace dependencies
    + include and import directives
    + constraints on simple types
  * Validate the documents against their schema
 .
 This package contains the prebuilt Security Assertion Markup Language bindings
 for Python3.
