Description: YAML parser and emitter for Python (debug build)
 Python-yaml is a complete YAML 1.1 parser and emitter for Python.  It can parse
 all examples from the specification. The parsing algorithm is simple enough to
 be a reference for YAML parser implementors. A simple extension API is also
 provided.  The package is built using libyaml for improved speed.
 .
 This package contains the extension built for the Python debug interpreter.
