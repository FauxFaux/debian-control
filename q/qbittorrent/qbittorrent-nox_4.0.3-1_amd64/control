Description: bittorrent client based on libtorrent-rasterbar (without X support)
 BitTorrent client written in C++ and based on libtorrent-rasterbar.
 qBittorrent-nox is a version of qBittorrent (Qt5 application) that does not
 require X and can be controlled via a WebUI, thus is more suitable for headless
 servers. It is a feature rich but lightweight client that is very similar to
 rTorrent. Its main features are:
 .
  * Remote control through a Web user interface
  * Vuze-compatible protocol encryption
  * uTorrent-compatible Peer eXchange (PeX)
  * DHT (trackerless) support
  * UPnP / NAT-PMP port forwarding
  * IPv6 compliant
  * Advanced control over torrent content and trackers
  * IP Filtering (eMule / Peer Guardian filters)
  * Torrents queueing and prioritizing
  * Good localization (~25 languages supported)
  * Unicode support
