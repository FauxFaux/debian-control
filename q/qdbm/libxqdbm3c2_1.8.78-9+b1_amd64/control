Description: QDBM Database Libraries for C++ [runtime]
 QDBM is an embedded database library compatible with GDBM and NDBM.
 It features hash database and B+ tree database and is developed referring
 to GDBM for the purpose of the following three points: higher processing
 speed, smaller size of a database file, and simpler API.
 This is the runtime package for programs that use the QDBM
 database library.  This is only for programs which use the C++ interface.
