Description: Quickly parses declarations and Javadoc from Java source
 qdox quickly parses Java source files looking for key items of
 interest:
  * class and interface definitions
  * member declarations
  * import statements
  * JavaDoc comments
 .
 qdox ignores all other components of Java source, such as actual method
 implementations, to avoid overhead.  qdox returns a simple document
 model containing only the declarations and containing enough
 information to be useful.
