Description: quickly parses declarations and Javadoc from Java source
 QDox quickly parses Java source files looking for key items of
 interest:
  * class and interface definitions
  * member declarations
  * import statements
  * JavaDoc comments
 .
 QDox ignores all other components of Java source, such as actual method
 implementations, to avoid overhead. QDox returns a simple document model
 containing only the declarations and containing enough information to be
 useful.
 .
 This is version 2 of QDox which is backwards incompatible with earlier
 versions.
