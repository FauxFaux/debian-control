Description: QEMU full system emulation binaries
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports
 ARM, CRIS, i386, M68k (ColdFire), MicroBlaze, MIPS, PowerPC, SH4,
 SPARC and x86-64 emulation. By using dynamic translation it achieves
 reasonable speed while being easy to port on new host CPUs.
 .
 This metapackage provides the full system emulation binaries for all supported
 targets, by depending on all per-architecture system emulation packages which
 QEMU supports.
