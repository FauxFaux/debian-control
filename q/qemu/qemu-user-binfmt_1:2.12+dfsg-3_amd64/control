Description: QEMU user mode binfmt registration for qemu-user
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports
 ARM, CRIS, i386, M68k (ColdFire), MicroBlaze, MIPS, PowerPC, SH4,
 SPARC and x86-64 emulation. By using dynamic translation it achieves
 reasonable speed while being easy to port on new host CPUs.
 .
 This package provides binfmt support registration for the user mode
 emulation binaries from qemu-user.  This is an empty package, it does
 not contain any additional files, only registration scripts which run
 at install and remove times.
