Description: QEMU user mode emulation binaries
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports
 ARM, CRIS, i386, M68k (ColdFire), MicroBlaze, MIPS, PowerPC, SH4,
 SPARC and x86-64 emulation. By using dynamic translation it achieves
 reasonable speed while being easy to port on new host CPUs.
 .
 This package provides the user mode emulation binaries. In this mode
 QEMU can launch Linux processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU.
 .
 If qemu-user-binfmt package is also installed, it will register binary
 format handlers from this qemu-user package with the kernel so it will
 be possible to run foreign binaries directly.  However, this might not
 be suitable for using inside foreign chroots, in which case it is
 possible to use qemu-user-static package instead of qemu-user-binmft, --
 qemu-user-static will register statically linked binfmt handlers instead.
