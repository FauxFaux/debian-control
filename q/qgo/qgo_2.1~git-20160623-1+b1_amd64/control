Description: Go client and full featured SGF editor
 qGo is a computerized board on which you can play the game of Go
 against another player, view and edit smart-go files, and connect to
 Go servers on the internet. It can also interface with computer Go
 programs such as GNU Go that speak the Go modem protocol. Have a look
 at the cgoban package if you are interested in a Go client with less
 package dependencies.

 game.
