Description: calculate convex hulls and related structures (development files)
 Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace
 intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site
 Delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It
 runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions.
 .
 This package contains the files necessary for development (headers and
 libraries), as well as the library documentation in HTML format.
