Description: calculate convex hulls and related structures (utilities)
 Qhull computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace
 intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site
 Delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It
 runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions.
 .
 This package contains the qhull executable that gives a pipe interface to
 some of the functionality of the library.  Also included is rbox is a
 useful tool in generating input for Qhull; it generates hypercubes,
 diamonds, cones, circles, simplices, spirals, lattices, and random points.
 .
 Qhull produces graphical output for Geomview.  This helps with
 understanding the output (http://www.geomview.org).
