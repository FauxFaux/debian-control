Description: QASM quantum circuit simulator with realistic noise written in C++
 qasm-simulator-cpp is a quantum circuit simulator written in C++
 that includes a variety of realistic circuit level noise models.
 The simulator may be run as a command line application to
 evaluate quantum programs specified by a Quantum program OBJect
 (QObj). qasm-simulator-cpp was developed by the QISKit team.
 .
 QISKit (Quantum Information Science Kit) is a collection of software developed
 by IBM Research for working with short depth quantum circuits and building
 near term applications and experiments on quantum computers.
