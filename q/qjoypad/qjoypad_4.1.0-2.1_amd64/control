Description: Program for mapping gamepad/joystick events to mouse/keyboard event
 QJoyPad takes input from a gamepad or joystick and translates it into
 key strokes or mouse actions, letting you control any X-Windows program
 with your game controller. This lets you play all those games that for
 some reason don't have joystick support with your joystick.
