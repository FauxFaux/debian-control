Description: Qt-based library that maps JSON data to QVariant objects - development files
 JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
 It can represent integers, real numbers, strings, an ordered sequence of
 values, and a collection of name/value pairs.
 .
 QJson is a Qt-based library that maps JSON data to QVariant objects: JSON
 arrays will be mapped to QVariantList instances, while JSON objects will be
 mapped to QVariantMap.
 .
 These are the development files.
