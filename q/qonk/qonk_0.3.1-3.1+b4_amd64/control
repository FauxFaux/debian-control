Description: Small build-and-conquer strategy game with very simple rules
 The setting of the game is a solar system of planets. Your goal is to
 conquer all of the planets in the game by sending ships there. Planets
 that are under your control generate new ships. Simple AI players are
 playing against you. As you gain more experience throughout the game,
 more AI players have to be kicked out of bigger solar systems.
