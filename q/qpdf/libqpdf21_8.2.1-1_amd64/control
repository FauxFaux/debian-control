Description: runtime library for PDF transformation/inspection software
 QPDF is a program that can be used to linearize (web-optimize),
 encrypt (password-protect), decrypt, and inspect PDF files from the
 command-line.  It does these and other structural, content-preserving
 transformations on PDF files, reading a PDF file as input and
 creating a new one as output.  It also provides many useful
 capabilities to developers of PDF-producing software or for people
 who just want to look at the innards of a PDF file to learn more
 about how they work.
 .
 QPDF understands PDF files that use compressed object streams
 (supported by newer PDF applications) and can convert such files into
 those that can be read with older viewers.  It can also be used for
 checking PDF files for structural errors, inspecting stream contents,
 or extracting objects from PDF files.  QPDF is not PDF content
 creation or viewing software -- it does not have the capability to
 create PDF files from scratch or to display PDF files.
 .
 This package contains the qpdf runtime libraries required to run
 programs that link with the qpdf library.
