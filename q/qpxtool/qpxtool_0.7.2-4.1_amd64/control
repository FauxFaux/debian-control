Description: CD/DVD quality checker
 QPxTool gives you access to all available Quality Checks (Q-Checks) on written
 and blank media, that are available for your drive. This will help you to find
 the right media and the optimized writing speed for your hardware, which will
 increase the chance for a long data lifetime.
 .
 QPxTool depends on the used drive, not all drives are able to read the Q-Checks
 and not all of them are supported by QPxTool. Currently, most newer drives of
 LiteOn, NEC, Pioneer and Plextor are supported.
