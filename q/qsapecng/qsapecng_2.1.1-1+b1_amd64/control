Description: symbolic analyzer and solver of linear analog circuits
 This program consists of two independent parts: the SapecNG framework engine
 and the GUI application QSapecNG.
 .
 QSapecNG is an open source, multi-platform project, continuously enhanced by
 students and researchers of the Department of Electronics and
 Telecommunications (DET) of the University of Florence (Italy). It comes as
 continuation of SapWin for Windows, in order to give to the project a full
 compatibility on other platforms.
 .
 Through SapecNG/QSapecNG users can draw, solve and analyze analog circuits as
 well as manage them. Since version 2.0.0beta1 there is also the full support
 for sub-circuits that can be created, saved, reopened and added as part of
 other circuits.
 .
 SapecNG/QSapecNG is freely available on GitHub
 <https://github.com/skypjack/qsapecng>. A previous version of SapecNG is
 available on GitHub too <https://github.com/skypjack/sapecng>.
