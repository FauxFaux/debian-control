Description: small and fast Bayesian spam filter
 Quick Spam Filter (QSF) is an Open Source email classification filter,
 designed to be small, fast, and accurate, which works to classify incoming
 email as either spam or non-spam.
 .
 QSF's targets are speed, accuracy and simplicity:
  * It is small and is written in C so it starts up quickly, unlike filters
  written in Perl.
  * It understands MIME and HTML, so it can intelligently deal with modern
  spam, unlike older Bayesian filters such as ifile.
  * It runs as an inline filter rather than as a daemon, so it is simple to
  install.
  * It is written to do only one job - decide whether an email is spam or not
  using the content of the message alone - so it is less complex than filters
  such as SpamAssassin. Less complexity means bugs and security problems are
  less likely.
  * As well as words and word pairs, QSF also spots special patterns in email
  such as runs of gibberish, HTML comments embedded in text, and other common
  spam giveaways, and its flexible tokeniser allows more patterns to be added
  as spammers change their tactics.
