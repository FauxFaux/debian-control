Description: Qt Assistant compatibility binary (legacy)
 Qt is a cross-platform C++ application framework. Qt's primary feature
 is its rich set of widgets that provide standard GUI functionality.
 .
 This package contains the Qt Assistant compatibility version, based on
 Assistant Document Profile (.adp) files, and the associated QtAssistantClient
 library, for compatibility with applications providing help in that format.
 .
 New applications should use the new version of Qt Assistant introduced in Qt
 4.4, based on the Qt Help Framework also introduced in Qt 4.4, instead.
