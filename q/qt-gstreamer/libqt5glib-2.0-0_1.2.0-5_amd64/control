Description: C++ bindings library for GLib and GObject with a Qt-style API - Qt 5 build
 This package contains the QtGLib library, a library that provides
 C++ bindings for parts of the GLib and GObject APIs with a Qt-syle API.
 The bindings are designed to be easy to use for C++ programmers that are
 used to the Qt API and also provide easier integration with Qt by using
 Qt's data types where applicable.
 .
 This library serves as a base for building the QtGStreamer bindings library.
 .
 This package is part of the Qt5 version of QtGStreamer.
