Description: Qt 3D development tools
 Qt 3D provides functionality for near-realtime simulation systems with
 support for 2D and 3D rendering in both Qt C++ and Qt Quick applications.
 .
 This package contains development programs to use with Qt 3D.
 .
 At the moment there is only one tool here, qgltf, which can be used to
 import a variety of 3D model formats and export it into fast-to-load,
 optimized glTF assets embedded into Qt resource files.
