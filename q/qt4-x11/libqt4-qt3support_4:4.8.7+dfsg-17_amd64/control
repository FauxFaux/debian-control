Description: Qt 3 compatibility library for Qt 4
 Qt is a cross-platform C++ application framework. Qt's primary feature
 is its rich set of widgets that provide standard GUI functionality.
 .
 The Qt3Support module provides classes that ease porting from Qt 3 to Qt 4.
 .
 It allows applications designed to use deprecated Qt 3 classes and functions
 to work with Qt 4, with help from the qt3to4 porting tool found in the
 libqt4-dev-bin package.
