Description: Qt 4 qmake Makefile generator tool
 Qt is a cross-platform C++ application framework. Qt's primary feature
 is its rich set of widgets that provide standard GUI functionality.
 .
 This package contains Qt 4 qmake (qmake-qt4), a tool that helps simplify
 the build process for development project across different platforms.
 qmake automates the generation of Makefiles so that only a few lines of
 information are needed to create each Makefile. qmake can be used for any
 software project, whether it is written using Qt or not.
 .
 Qt 4 qmake requires a platform and compiler description file which contains
 many default values used to generate appropriate Makefiles.
 .
 This package contains also these platform specifications.
