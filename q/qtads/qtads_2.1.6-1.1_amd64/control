Description: Qt HTML interpreter for TADS
 This package provides an interpreter for TADS game files, using a
 Qt interface.  It can run either TADS 2 games (which have an
 extension of .gam) or TADS 3 games (which have an extension of .t3).
 See http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXtads.html for a
 large collection of available TADS games.
 .
 This interpreter supports HTML-TADS multimedia features.  Other
 features include:
   * Full Unicode support for TADS 3 and HTML TADS games.
   * Full text justification.
   * Support for multiple user configurations, which you can switch
     between at runtime.
 .
 TADS, the Text Adventure Development System, is a system for writing
 and playing interactive fiction games.  This means that the primary
 method for interacting with the game is to type in commands, to which
 the game produces a response in prose -- similar to Infocom's games
 from the 1980's.
