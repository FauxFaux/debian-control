Description: Qt 5 development defaults package
 Qt is a cross-platform C++ application framework. Qt's primary feature
 is its rich set of widgets that provide standard GUI functionality.
 .
 This package sets Qt 5 to be the default Qt version to be used when
 using development binaries like qmake. It provides a default
 configuration for qtchooser, but does not prevent alternative Qt
 installations from being used.
 .
 This package should not be used for building Debian packages. Take a
 look at https://qt-kde-team.pages.debian.net/packagingqtbasedstuff.html for
 more information.
