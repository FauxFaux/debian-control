Description: Qt 5 QML module
 Qt is a cross-platform C++ application framework. Qt's primary feature
 is its rich set of widgets that provide standard GUI functionality.
 .
 The Qt QML module provides a framework for developing applications and
 libraries with the QML language. It defines and implements the language
 and engine infrastructure, and provides an API to enable application
 developers to extend the QML language with custom types and integrate
 QML code with JavaScript and C++.
