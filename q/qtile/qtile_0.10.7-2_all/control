Description: Small, simple, extensible X11 window manager written in Python
 Qtile is:
   * simple, small and extensible. It's easy to write your own layouts,
     widgets and built-in commands.
   * configured entirely in Python.
   * command-line shell that allows all aspects of Qtile to be manipulated and
     inspected.
   * complete remote scriptability - write scripts to set up workspaces,
     manipulate windows, update status bar widgets and more.
   * unit tested. Qtile's scriptability has made thorough unit testing
     possible, making it one of the best-tested window managers around.
