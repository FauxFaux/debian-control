Description: data analysis and scientific plotting
 Qtiplot is a fully fledged plotting software similar to the OriginLab
 Origin software (See http://www.originlab.com for more information
 about Origin).
 .
 It can make two and three dimensional plots of publication quality,
 both from datasets and functions. It can do non-linear fitting and
 multi-peak fitting.
 .
 Some Features:
  * Cross platform: works natively on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux/Unix
    systems
  * Fully Python scriptable
  * OpenGL based 3D plotting
  * Publication quality plots and easy export to various image formats
    (EMF, EPS, PS, PDF, SVG, BMP, JPG, PNG, TIFF, etc ...)
  * Easy integration with LaTeX typesetting system
  * Powerful and versatile spreadsheets with column-logic calculations
    and easy import/export of multiple files
  * One-click access to extensive built-in data analysis routines
  * Advanced statistical analysis: Student's t-Test, ANOVA, chi-square
    test for variance, normality test (Shapiro-Wilk)
  * Linear and nonlinear curve fitting with weighting and estimation
    of statistical errors of the fit-parameters
  * Multi-peak fitting
  * Image analysis tools
  * Templates support: all settings for plots, tables and matrices can
    be saved and restored later on for a fast editing process
  * Project files based on folders, a powerful project explorer with
    built-in drag and drop and searching facilities
  * Full import of Excel workbooks and Open Document Format
    spreadsheets, dBase, SQLite and Microsoft Access databases
