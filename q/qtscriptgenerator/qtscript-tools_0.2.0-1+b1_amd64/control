Description: tools for QtScript developers
 This package contains QtScript Generator and a simple helper program which
 can be used to launch scripts from the command line.
 .
 QtScript Generator is a tool that generates Qt bindings for QtScript. With
 the generated bindings you get access to substantial portions of the Qt API
 from within QtScript. The binary has been renamed to 'qs_generator' in this
 package.
 .
 qs_eval is a simple script interpreter / launcher that imports all the
 bindings. You can use it to run examples found in the libqtscript4-doc
 package.
