Description: Web communication library for Qt - development files
 Qt WebChannel enables peer-to-peer communication between the host (QML/C++

 mechanism is supported out of the box by the two popular web engines, Qt
 WebKit 2 and Qt WebEngine.
 .
 This package contains the development files needed to build Qt 5 applications
