 QuakeSpasm is a Unix-friendly Quake engine based on the SDL port of the
 popular FitzQuake. It includes some new features, important fixes, and aims
 for portability and correctness.

 This engine is typically used via a script that launches it with a particular
 data set, such as the one found in the "quake" package.
