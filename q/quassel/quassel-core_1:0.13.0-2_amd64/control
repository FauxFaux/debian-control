Description: distributed IRC client - core component
 Quassel is a modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client, meaning that
 one or more clients can attach to and detach from the central core. It's
 much like the popular combination of screen and a text-based IRC client
 such as WeeChat or irssi, but graphical.
 .
 This package provides only the core component.
