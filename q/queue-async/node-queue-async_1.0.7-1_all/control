Description: asynchronous helper library for JavaScript - NodeJS
 Yet another asynchronous helper library for JavaScript. Think of it as a
 minimalist version of Async.js that allows fine-tuning over parallelism. Or,
 think of it as a version of TameJs that does not use code generation.
 .
 This package contains the NodeJS module.
