Description: fast and easy to use calculator with support for filing
 Quickcal accepts quick pasting of a large set of numbers, separated with
 newlines or spaces or tabs and performs arithmetic / statistical calculations
 based on the button or keyboard shortcut pressed.
 .
 As in other calculators, basic math can be performed too, with the +,-,*,/,%,^
 operators, in between numbers. Setting the scale allows for more decimals to
 be displayed. Also, about 65 statistical calculations can be performed by
 choosing an option from the more stats list box.
 .
 Filing and viewing support for history and tallying purpose, at the end of the
 day, helpful for shopkeepers and others too.
