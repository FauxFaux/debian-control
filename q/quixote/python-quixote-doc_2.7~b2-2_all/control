Description: Quixote web application framework documentation
 This package contains the documentation and examples for Quixote.
 Quixote is yet another framework for developing Web applications in
 Python. If you view a web site as a program, and web pages as
 subroutines, Quixote just might be the tool for you. If you view a
 web site as a graphic design showcase, and each web page as an
 individual work of art, Quixote is probably not what you're looking for.
 The full list of its design goals is listed in the description to
 python-quixote package.
