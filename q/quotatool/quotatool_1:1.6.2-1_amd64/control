Description: non-interactive command line tool to edit disk quotas
 Quotatool is a utility for manipulating the Linux Diskquota system, which
 sets file system usage caps for users.
 .
 The "edquota" tool in the standard quota package goes through a text
 editor; "quotatool" on the other hand can set disk quotas directly from
 the command line, and is suitable for use in scripts and other
 non-interactive situations.
