Description: advanced interactive crossword construction tool
 Qxw is a program to help you create and publish crosswords,
 from the simplest blocked grid to sophisticated thematic
 puzzles. It can make rectangular-, hexagonal- or
 circular-format grids with blocks, bars or both. It
 has an automatic grid-filling facility that can handle a
 wide range of answer treatments and you can even add your
 own answer treatment methods. Grids can be filled using
 letters, digits, or a mixture of both. Qxw can produce
 output in a range of formats ready for publication.
 .
 Qxw is written in C and has a GUI based on GTK+.
