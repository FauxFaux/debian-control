Description: GNU R interface package for the BIOM file format
 This is an R package for interfacing with the BIOM format. This package
 includes basic tools for reading biom-format files, accessing and
 subsetting data tables from a biom object (which is more complex than a
 single table), as well as limited support for writing a biom-object back
 to a biom-format file. The design of this API is intended to match the
 Python API and other tools included with the biom-format project, but
 with a decidedly "R flavor" that should be familiar to R users. This
 includes S4 classes and methods, as well as extensions of common core
 functions/methods.
