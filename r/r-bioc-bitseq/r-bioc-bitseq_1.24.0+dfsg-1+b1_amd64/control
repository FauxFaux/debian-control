Description: transcript expression inference and analysis for RNA-seq data
 The BitSeq package is targeted for transcript expression
 analysis and differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data
 in two stage process. In the first stage it uses Bayesian
 inference methodology to infer expression of individual
 transcripts from individual RNA-seq experiments. The second
 stage of BitSeq embraces the differential expression analysis
 of transcript expression. Providing expression estimates from
 replicates of multiple conditions, Log-Normal model of the
 estimates is used for inferring the condition mean transcript
 expression and ranking the transcripts based on the likelihood
 of differential expression.
