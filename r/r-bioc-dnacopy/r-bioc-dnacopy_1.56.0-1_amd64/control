Description: R package: DNA copy number data analysis
 Implements the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm to segment DNA
 copy number data and identify genomic regions with abnormal copy number.
 .
 This package is for analyzing array DNA copy number data, which is usually
 (but not always) called array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (array CGH)
 data It implements a methodology for finding change-points in these data which
 are points after which the (log) test over reference ratios have changed
 location. This model is that the change-points correspond to positions where
 the underlying DNA copy number has changed. Therefore, change-points can be
 used to identify regions of gained and lost copy number. Also provided is a
 function for making relevant plots of these data.
