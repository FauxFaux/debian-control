Description: GNU R package to visualise long vector data
 This tool allows one to display very long data vectors in a space-efficient
 manner, by organising it along a 2D Hilbert curve. The user can then
 visually judge the large scale structure and distribution of features
 simultaenously with the rough shape and intensity of individual features.
 .
 In bioinformatics, a typical use case is ChIP-Chip and ChIP-Seq,
 or basically all the kinds of genomic data, that are conventionally
 displayed as quantitative track ("wiggle data") in genome browsers such
 as those provided by Ensembl or UCSC.
