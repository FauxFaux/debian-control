Description: GNU R low-level containers for storing sets of integer ranges
 The IRanges class and its extensions are low-level containers for
 storing sets of integer ranges. A typical use of these containers in
 biology is for representing a set of chromosome regions. More specific
 extensions of the IRanges class will typically allow the storage of
 additional information attached to each chromosome region as well as a
 hierarchical relationship between these regions.
