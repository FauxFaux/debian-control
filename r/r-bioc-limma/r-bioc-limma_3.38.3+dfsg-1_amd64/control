Description: linear models for microarray data
 A Bioconductor package for the analysis of gene expression microarray data,
 especially the use of linear models for analysing designed experiments and the
 assessment of differential expression. The package includes pre-processing
 capabilities for two-colour spotted arrays. The differential expression methods
 apply to all array platforms and treat Affymetrix, single channel and two
 channel experiments in a unified way.
