Description: Integrative network analysis of omics data
 The Mergeomics pipeline serves as a flexible framework for integrating
 multidimensional omics-disease associations, functional genomics,
 canonical pathways and gene-gene interaction networks to generate
 mechanistic hypotheses. It includes two main parts:
 1) Marker set enrichment analysis (MSEA);
 2) Weighted Key Driver Analysis (wKDA).
