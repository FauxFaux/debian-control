Description: Bioconductor resampling-based multiple hypothesis testing
 Non-parametric bootstrap and permutation resampling-based multiple
 testing procedures (including empirical Bayes methods) for controlling
 the family-wise error rate (FWER), generalized family-wise error rate
 (gFWER), tail probability of the proportion of false positives (TPPFP),
 and false discovery rate (FDR). Several choices of bootstrap-based null
 distribution are implemented (centered, centered and scaled,
 quantile-transformed). Single-step and step-wise methods are available.
 Tests based on a variety of t- and F-statistics (including t-statistics
 based on regression parameters from linear and survival models as well
 as those based on correlation parameters) are included. When probing
 hypotheses with t-statistics, users may also select a potentially faster
 null distribution which is multivariate normal with mean zero and
 variance covariance matrix derived from the vector influence function.
 Results are reported in terms of adjusted p-values, confidence regions
 and test statistic cutoffs. The procedures are directly applicable to
 identifying differentially expressed genes in DNA microarray
 experiments.
