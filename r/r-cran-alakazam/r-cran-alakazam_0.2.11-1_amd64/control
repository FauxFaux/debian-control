Description: Immunoglobulin Clonal Lineage and Diversity Analysis
 Alakazam is part of the Immcantation analysis framework for Adaptive
 Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) and provides a set of
 tools to investigate lymphocyte receptor clonal lineages, diversity,
 gene usage, and other repertoire level properties, with a focus on
 high-throughput immunoglobulin (Ig) sequencing.
 .
 Alakazam serves five main purposes:
  * Providing core functionality for other R packages in the Immcantation
    framework. This includes common tasks such as file I/O, basic DNA
    sequence manipulation, and interacting with V(D)J segment and gene
    annotations.
  * Providing an R interface for interacting with the output of the
    pRESTO and Change-O tool suites.
  * Performing lineage reconstruction on clonal populations of Ig
    sequences and analyzing the topology of the resultant lineage trees.
  * Performing clonal abundance and diversity analysis on lymphocyte
    repertoires.
  * Performing physicochemical property analyses of lymphocyte receptor
    sequences.
