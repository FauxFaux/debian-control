Description: GNU R routines for block diagonal symmetric matrices
 Provides an R class for block diagonal symmetric matrices, allowing them to be
 manipulated much like an ordinary matrix, but the total memory use can be much
 smaller.
 .
 Also provides a solver for such matrices, and generalized Cholesky
 decomposition routines for both symmetric and block diagonal symmetric
 matrices.
