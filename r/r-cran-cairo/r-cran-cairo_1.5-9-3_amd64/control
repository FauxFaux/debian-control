Description: GNU R graphics device using cairo graphics library
 GNUR R graphics device using cairo graphics library for creating high-
 quality bitmap (PNG, JPEG, TIFF), vector (PDF, SVG, PostScript) and
 display (X11 and Win32) output
 .
 Cairo graphics device that can be use to create high-quality vector
 (PDF, PostScript and SVG) and bitmap output (PNG,JPEG,TIFF), and high-
 quality rendering in displays (X11 and Win32). Since it uses the same
 back-end for all output, copying across formats is WYSIWYG. Files are
 created without the dependence on X11 or other external programs. This
 device supports alpha channel (semi-transparent drawing) and resulting
 images can contain transparent and semi-transparent regions. It is ideal
 for use in server environments (file output) and as a replacement for
 other devices that don't have Cairo's capabilities such as alpha support
 or anti-aliasing. Backends are modular such that any subset of backends
 is supported.
