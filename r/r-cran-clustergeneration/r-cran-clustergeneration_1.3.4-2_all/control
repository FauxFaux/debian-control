Description: GNU R random cluster generation (with specified degree of separation)
 The GNU R package clusterGeneration provides functions for generating
 random clusters, generating random covariance/correlation matrices,
 calculating a separation index (data and population version) for pairs
 of clusters or cluster distributions, and 1-D and 2-D projection plots
 to visualize clusters.  The package also contains a function to generate
 random clusters based on factorial designs with factors such as degree
 of separation, number of clusters, number of variables, number of noisy
 variables.
