Description: Output analysis and diagnostics for MCMC simulations in R
 This package provides output analysis and diagnostics for Markov Chain
 Monte Carlo simulations and estimations within R.  It also includes some
 graphical analysis routines and a facility for importing output from BUGS
 (Bayes Using Gibbs Sampling), a popular tool for running MCMC simulations.
 .
 The related r-cran-mcmcpack package includes MCMC estimators for some
 common models in the social sciences.
