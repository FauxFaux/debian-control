Description: GNU R package for dynamic linear models and time series regression
 This R package provides a user-friendly interface for fitting dynamic linear
 models and time series regression relationships
 .
 The interface and internals of dynlm are very similar to lm, but currently
 dynlm offers three advantages over the direct use of lm:
  - extended formula processing;
  - preservation of time series attributes;
  - instrumental variables regression (via two-stage least squares).
