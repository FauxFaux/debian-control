Description: GNU R package for delayed-data
 g.data creates and maintains delayed-data packages (DDP's). Data
 stored in a DDP are available on demand, but do not take up memory
 until requested.  You attach a DDP with g.data.attach(), then read from
 it and assign to it in a manner similar to S-Plus, except that you must
 run g.data.save() to actually commit to disk.
