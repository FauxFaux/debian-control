Description: GNU R mesh generation and surface tesselation
 This GNU R package makes the qhull library (www.qhull.org)
 available in R, in a similar manner as in Octave and MATLAB. Qhull
 computes convex hulls, Delaunay triangulations, halfspace
 intersections about a point, Voronoi diagrams, furthest-site
 Delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site Voronoi diagrams. It
 runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions. It implements the
 Quickhull algorithm for computing the convex hull. Qhull does not
 support constrained Delaunay triangulations, or mesh generation of
 non-convex objects, but the package does include some R functions
 that allow for this. Currently the package only gives access to
 Delaunay triangulation and convex hull computation.
