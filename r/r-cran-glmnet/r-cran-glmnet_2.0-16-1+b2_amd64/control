Description: Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized Generalized Linear Models
 Extremely efficient procedures for fitting the entire lasso or elastic-net
 regularization path for linear regression, logistic and multinomial
 regression models, Poisson regression and the Cox model. Two recent
 additions are the multiple-response Gaussian, and the grouped multinomial.
 The algorithm uses cyclical coordinate descent in a path-wise fashion, as
 described in the paper Introduction to Glmnet.
