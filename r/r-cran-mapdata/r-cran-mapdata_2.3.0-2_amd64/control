Description: GNU R support for producing geographic maps (supplemental data)
 This package provides facilities for easily producing high-resolution
 maps based on data sets in the GNU R statistical computing
 environment.  It includes high-resolution map data for the entire
 world, along with maps of China (including provincial boundaries) and
 a higher-resolution map of New Zealand and a number of nearby Pacific
 islands.
 .
 The suggested r-cran-mapproj package adds facilities for
 calculating geographic projections, which are used by mapmakers to
 compensate for the inaccuracies inherent in projecting a spheroid's
 surface onto a two-dimensional plane.
