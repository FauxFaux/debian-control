Description: GNU R support for cartographic projections of map data
 This package provides facilities for easily producing cartographic
 projections of maps based on data sets in the GNU R statistical
 computing environment.  Projections are used by mapmakers to
 compensate for the inaccuracies inherent in projecting a spheroid's
 surface onto a two-dimensional plane.
