Description: GNU R support for producing geographic maps
 This package provides facilities for easily producing maps based on
 data sets in the GNU R statistical computing environment.
 .
 The r-cran-maps package includes map data for the United States
 (including state and county-level maps), New Zealand, and a world
 map; additional maps (including a higher-resolution world map) are
 available in the suggested r-cran-mapdata package.
 .
 The suggested r-cran-mapproj package adds facilities for calculating
 geographic projections, which are used by mapmakers to compensate for
 the inaccuracies inherent in projecting a spheroid's surface onto a
 two-dimensional plane.
