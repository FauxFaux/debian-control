Description: GNU R interface to Unidata netCDF format data files
 High-level R interface to data files written using Unidata's netCDF
 library (version 4 or earlier), which are binary data files that are
 portable across platforms and include metadata information in addition
 to the data sets. Using this package, netCDF files
 (either version 4 or "classic" version 3) can be opened and data sets
 read in easily. It is also easy to create new netCDF dimensions,
 variables, and files, in either version 3 or 4 format, and manipulate
 existing netCDF files.
