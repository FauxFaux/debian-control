Description: GNU R unified interface to parallelization back-ends
 Unified parallelization framework for multiple back-end,
 designed for internal package and interactive usage.
 The main operation is a parallel "map" over lists.
 Supports local, multicore, mpi and BatchJobs mode.
 Allows "tagging" of the parallel operation
 with a level name that can be later selected by the user to
 switch on parallel execution for exactly this operation.
