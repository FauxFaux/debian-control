Description: GNU R package to create simple packages
 This package provides a function kitten() which create cute little
 packages which pass R CMD check. This sets it apart from
 package.skeleton() which it calls, and which leaves imperfect files
 behind. As this is not exactly helpful for beginners, kitten() offers
 an alternative.
