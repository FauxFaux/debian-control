Description: GNU R estimators and tests for panel data econometrics
 This R package intends to make the estimation of linear panel models
 straightforward. It provides functions to estimate a wide variety of models=
 and to make (robust) inference.
 .
 The main functions to estimate models are:
  - plm: panel data estimators using lm on transformed data,
  - pgmm: generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation for panel data,
  - pvcm: variable coefficients models for panel data,
  - pmg: mean groups (MG), demeaned MG and common correlated effects (CCEMG)
    estimators.
 .
 Next to the model estimation functions, the package offers several functions
 for statistical tests related to panel data/models.
 .
 Multiple functions for (robust) variance-covariance matrices are at hand as
 well. The package also provides data sets to demonstrate functions and to
 replicate some text book/paper results.
