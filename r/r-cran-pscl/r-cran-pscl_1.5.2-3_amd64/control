Description: GNU R package for discrete data models
 This package consists of R functions developed at the Political
 Science Computational Laboratory at Stanford University; it currently
 includes models for count data (hurdle regression and zero-inflated
 negative binomial and Poisson models), ordinal probit and logit (also
 available in MASS via polr), and an item-response theory model.  Also
 included are Vuong tests for non-nested hypothesis testing and
 convenience functions for handling roll-call vote matrices.
