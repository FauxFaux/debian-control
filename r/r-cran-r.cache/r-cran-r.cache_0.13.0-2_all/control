Description: R package: Fast and Light-Weight Caching of Objects and Results
 Memoization can be used to speed up repetitive and computational expensive
 function calls. The first time a function that implements memoization is
 called the results are stored in a cache memory. The next time the function is
 called with the same set of parameters, the results are momentarily retrieved
 from the cache avoiding repeating the calculations. With this package, any R
 object can be cached in a key-value storage where the key can be an arbitrary
 set of R objects. The cache memory is persistent (on the file system).
