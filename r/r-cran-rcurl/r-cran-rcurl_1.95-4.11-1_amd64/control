Description: GNU R General network (HTTP/FTP/...) client interface
 The package allows one to compose general HTTP requests and provides
 convenient functions to fetch URIs, get & post forms, etc. and process
 the results returned by the Web server. This provides a great deal of
 control over the HTTP/FTP/... connection and the form of the request
 while providing a higher-level interface than is available just using R
 socket connections. Additionally, the underlying implementation is
 robust and extensive, supporting FTP/FTPS/TFTP (uploads and downloads),
 SSL/HTTPS, telnet, dict, ldap, and also supports cookies, redirects,
 authentication, etc.
