Description: GNU R package for the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX) framework
 This package provides a set of classes and methods to read data and metadata
 documents exchanged through the Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX)
 framework, currently focusing on the SDMX XML standard format (SDMX-ML).
 .
 SDMX is an initiative to foster standards for the exchange of statistical
 information. It is sponsored by several major providers of statistical
 information: the Bank for International Settlements, the European Central
 Bank, Eurostat (the statistical office of the European Union), the
 International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
 and Development (OECD), the United Nations Statistics Division, the United
 Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the World Bank.
 .
 The package can therefore be used to download statistical information from the
 servers of those organizations, and from those of several other institutions.
