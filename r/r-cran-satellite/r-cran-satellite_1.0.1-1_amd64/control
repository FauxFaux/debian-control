Description: GNU R handling and manipulating remote sensing data
 This package provides a broad variety of functions which are useful
 for handling, manipulating, and visualizing satellite-based remote sensing
 data. These operations range from mere data import and layer handling (eg
 subsetting), over Raster* typical data wrangling (eg crop, extend), to more
 sophisticated (pre-)processing tasks typically applied to satellite imagery
 (eg atmospheric and topographic correction). This functionality is
 complemented by a full access to the satellite layers' metadata at any
 stage and the documentation of performed actions in a separate log file.
 Currently available sensors include Landsat 4-5 (TM), 7 (ETM+), and 8
 (OLI/TIRS Combined), and additional compatibility is ensured for the Landsat
 Global Land Survey data set. Moreover, support for Terra and Aqua-MODIS as
 well as PROBA-V is expected to arrive shortly.
