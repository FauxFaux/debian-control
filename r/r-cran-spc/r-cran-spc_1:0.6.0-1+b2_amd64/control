Description: GNU R Statistical Process Control
 Evaluation of control charts by means of the zero-state, steady-state ARL
 (Average Run Length). Setting up control charts for given in-control ARL
 and plotting of the related figures. The control charts under consideration
 are one- and two-sided EWMA and CUSUM charts for monitoring the mean of
 normally distributed independent data. Now, the ARL calculation of
 EWMA-S^2 control charts is added. Other charts and parameters are in
 preparation. Further SPC areas will be covered as well (sampling plans,
 capability indices ...).
