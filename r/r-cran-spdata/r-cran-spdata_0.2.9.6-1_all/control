Description: GNU R datasets for spatial analysis
 Diverse spatial datasets for demonstrating, benchmarking and teaching
 spatial data analysis. It includes R data of class sf (defined by the
 package 'sf'), Spatial ('sp'), and nb ('spdep'). Unlike other spatial
 data packages such as 'rnaturalearth' and 'maps', it also contains data
 stored in a range of file formats including GeoJSON, ESRI Shapefile and
 GeoPackage. Some of the datasets are designed to illustrate specific
 analysis techniques. cycle_hire and cycle_hire_osm, for example, is
 designed to illustrate point pattern analysis techniques.
