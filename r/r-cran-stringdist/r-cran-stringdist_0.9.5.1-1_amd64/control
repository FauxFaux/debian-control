Description: GNU R approximate string matching and string distance functions
 Implements an approximate string matching version of R's native 'match'
 function. Can calculate various string distances based on edits (Damerau-
 Levenshtein, Hamming, Levenshtein, optimal sting alignment), qgrams (q-
 gram, cosine, jaccard distance) or heuristic metrics (Jaro, Jaro-
 Winkler). An implementation of soundex is provided as well. Distances
 can be computed between character vectors while taking proper care of
 encoding or between integer vectors representing generic sequences.
