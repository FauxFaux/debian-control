Description: GNU R character string processing facilities
 Allows for fast, correct, consistent, portable, as well as convenient
 character string/text processing in every locale and any native
 encoding. Owing to the use of the ICU library, the package provides R
 users with platform-independent functions known to Java, Perl, Python,
 PHP, and Ruby programmers. Among available features there are: pattern
 searching (e.g. via regular expressions), random string generation,
 string collation, transliteration, concatenation, date-time formatting
 and parsing, etc.
