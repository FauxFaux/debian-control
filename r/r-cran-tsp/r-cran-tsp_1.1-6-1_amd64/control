Description: GNU R traveling salesperson problem (TSP)
 Basic infrastructure and some algorithms for the traveling
 salesperson problem (also traveling salesman problem; TSP).
 The package provides some simple algorithms and
 an interface to the Concorde TSP solver and its implementation of the
 Chained-Lin-Kernighan heuristic. The code for Concorde
 itself is not included in the package and has to be obtained separately.
