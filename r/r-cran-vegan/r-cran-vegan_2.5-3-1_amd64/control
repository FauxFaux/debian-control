Description: Community Ecology Package for R
 R package for community ecologists. It contains most multivariate analysis
 needed in analysing ecological communities, and tools for diversity analysis.
 Most diversity methods assume that data are counts of individuals.
 .
 These tools are sometimes used outside the field of ecology, for instance to
 study populations of white blood cells or RNA molecules.
