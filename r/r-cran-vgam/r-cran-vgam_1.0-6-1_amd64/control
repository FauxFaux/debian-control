Description: GNU R package for estimating vector generalized additive models
 This package implements a variety of functions for estimating vector
 generalized additive models (VGAMs), as well as vector generalized
 linear models (VGLMs), reduced-rank VGLMs, and quadratic reduced-rank
 VGLMs.
 .
 Specific models that can be fit include a wide variety of
 categorical-response models (with nominal and ordinal dependent
 variables), bivariate binary-response models (bivariate
 logit/probit), and seemingly-unrelated regressions.  The package also
 includes a number of standard and non-standard distribution functions
 of use to statisticians.
