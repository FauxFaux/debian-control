Description: GNU R package for color maps from matplotlib (Lite Version)
 The viridis package provides a port of the new matplotlib color maps
 (viridis (default), magma, plasma and inferno) to R. matplotlib
 <http://matplotlib.org/ is a popular plotting library for
 Python. These color maps are designed in such a way that they will
 analytically be perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in regular form
 and also when converted to black-and-white. They are also designed to
 be perceived by readers with the most common form of color blindness.
