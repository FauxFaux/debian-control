Description: GNU R wavelet routines for 1-, 2- and 3-D signal processing
 Basic wavelet routines for time series (1D), image (2D)
 and array (3D) analysis.  The code provided here is based on
 wavelet methodology developed in Percival and Walden (2000);
 Gencay, Selcuk and Whitcher (2001); the dual-tree complex wavelet
 transform (DTCWT) from Kingsbury (1999, 2001) as implemented by
 Selesnick; and Hilbert wavelet pairs (Selesnick 2001, 2002).  All
 figures in chapters 4-7 of GSW (2001) are reproducible using this
 package and R code available at the book website(s) below.
