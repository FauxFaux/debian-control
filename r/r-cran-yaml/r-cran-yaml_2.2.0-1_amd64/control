Description: Methods to convert R data to YAML and back
 This package implements the LibYAML YAML 1.1 parser and emitter for R.  YAML is
 a human-readable markup language. With it, you can create easily readable
 documents that can be consumed by a variety of programming languages, including
 R.  The r-cran-yaml package has two main functions: yaml.load and as.yaml.  The
 yaml.load function is the YAML parsing function: it accepts a YAML document as
 a string and returns R data structures.  The as.yaml function is an S3 method
 used to convert R objects into YAML strings.
 .
 This package is useful for R programmers dealing with YAML documents.
