Description: GNU R ChIP-seq processing pipeline
 R package for anlaysis of ChIP-seq and other functional sequencing data
  * Assess overall DNA-binding signals in the data and select appropriate
    quality of tag alignment.
  * Discard or restrict positions with abnormally high number of tags.
  * Calculate genome-wide profiles of smoothed tag density and save them
    in WIG files for viewing in other browsers.
  * Calculate genome-wide profiles providing conservative statistical
    estimates of fold enrichment ratios along the genome. These can be
    exported for browser viewing, or thresholded to determine regions of
    significant enrichment/depletion.
  * Determine statistically significant point binding positions
  * Assess whether the set of point binding positions detected at a
    current sequencing depth meets saturation criteria, and if does not,
    estimate what sequencing depth would be required to do so.
