Description: GNU R package for fine-mapping complex diseases
 Happy is an R interface into the HAPPY C package for fine-mapping
 Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) in Heterogenous Stocks (HS). An HS is
 an advanced intercross between (usually eight) founder inbred strains
 of mice. HS are suitable for fine-mapping QTL.  It uses a multipoint
 analysis which offers significant improvements in statistical power to
 detect QTLs over that achieved by single-marker association.
 .
 The happy package is
 an extension of the original C program happy; it uses the C code to
 compute the probability of descent from each of the founders, at each
 locus position, but the happy packager allows a much richer range of
 models to be fit to the data.
 .

 detailed explanation.
