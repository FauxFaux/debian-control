 .
 This driver should only be used for devices not yet supported by the
 in-kernel driver r8169. Please see the README.Debian for instructions how
 to report bugs against r8169 that made it necessary to use r8168-dkms.
 .
 Installation of the r8168-dkms package will disable the in-kernel r8169
 module. To re-enable r8169, the r8168-dkms package must be purged.
 .
 This package provides the dkms source code for the r8168 kernel modules.
 Kernel source or headers are required to compile these modules.
