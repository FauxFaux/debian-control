 It supports the creation of new programming languages through a rich,
 expressive syntax system. Supplied languages include Typed Racket,
 ACL2, FrTime, and Lazy Racket, and R6RS Scheme.

 Racket includes the DrRacket programming environment, a virtual
 machine with a just-in-time compiler, tools for creating stand-alone
 executables, the Racket web server, extensive libraries, and
 documentation for both beginners and experts.
