Description: development file for librad0
 radlib is a C language library developed to abstract details of interprocess
 communications and common linux/unix system facilities so that application
 developers can concentrate on application solutions. It encourages developers
 (whether expert or novice) to use a proven paradigm of event-driven,
 asynchronous design. By abstracting interprocess messaging, events, timers,
 and any I/O device that can be represented as a file descriptor, radlib
 simplifies the implementation of multi-purpose processes, as well as multi-
 process applications.
 .
 This is the package needed for development.
