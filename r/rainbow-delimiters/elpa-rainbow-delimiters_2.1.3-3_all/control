Description: Emacs mode to colour-code delimiters according to their depth
 rainbow-delimiters is a "rainbow parentheses"-like mode which
 highlights delimiters such as parentheses, brackets or braces
 according to their depth. Each successive level is highlighted in a
 different color. This makes it easy to spot matching delimiters,
 orient yourself in the code, and tell which statements are at a given
 depth.
 .
 Great care has been taken to make this mode fast. You shouldn't see
 any change in scrolling or editing speed when it's on even when
 working in delimiter-rich languages like Clojure or Emacs Lisp. It
 can be used with any language.
 .
 You can customize the colors rainbow-delimiters uses. The default
 colors are intentionally subtle; they are unobtrusive enough to make
 the mode worth looking at even if you usually don't like rainbow
 parentheses modes. A number of major color themes such as Zenburn and
 Solarized have added their own faces for the mode.
