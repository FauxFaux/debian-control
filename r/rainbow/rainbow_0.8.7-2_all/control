Description: Bitfrost isolation shell
 Rainbow is a isolation shell which implements portions of the Bitfrost
 security architecture, as used on the OLPC XO-1 and elsewhere.
 .
 At the moment, Rainbow only knows how to provide the same primitive form
 of filesystem and signal isolation that competent sysadmins provide to
 users of multi-user Unix shell servers.
