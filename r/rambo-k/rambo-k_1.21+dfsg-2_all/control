Description: Read Assignment Method Based On K-mers
 RAMBO-K is a tool for rapid and sensitive removal of background sequences
 from Next Generation Sequencing data.
 .
 RAMBO-K is a reference-based tool for rapid and sensitive extraction of
 one organisms reads from a mixed dataset. It is based on a Markov chain
 implementation, which uses genomic characteristics of each reference to
 assign reads to the associated set.
