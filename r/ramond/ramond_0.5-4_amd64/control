Description: IPv6 Router Advertisement MONitoring Daemon
 ramond is a scriptable IPv6 Router Advertisement Monitoring Daemon.
 .
 The tool was designed to `clear' (by sending spoofed zero lifetime
 adverts) rogue-routes sent by users running 6to4 gateways on a campus
 network.
 .
 Actions are scriptable. Almost all the available information is
 passed to a script via environmental variables.
