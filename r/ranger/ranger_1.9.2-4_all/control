Description: Console File Manager with VI Key Bindings
 Ranger is a console file manager with VI key bindings.  It provides a
 minimalistic and nice curses interface with a view on the directory hierarchy.
 It ships with "rifle", a file launcher that is good at automatically finding
 out which program to use for what file type.
 .
 Design Goals
  * An easily maintainable file manager in a high level language
  * A quick way to switch directories and browse the file system
  * Keep it small but useful, do one thing and do it well
  * Console based, with smooth integration into the unix shell
