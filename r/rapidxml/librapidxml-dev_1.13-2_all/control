Description: fast XML DOM-style parser in C++ (development files)
 RapidXml is a fast XML DOM-style parser written in C++.
 .
 RapidXml provides a minimalistic API and reduced memory footprint suitable
 for embedded applications.
 .
 Limitations:
   * The parser ignores DOCTYPE declarations.
   * There is no support for XML namespaces.
   * The parser does not check for character validity.
   * The interface of the parser does not conform to DOM specification.
   * The parser does not check for attribute uniqueness.
