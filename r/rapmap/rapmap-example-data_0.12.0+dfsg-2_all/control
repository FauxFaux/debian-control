Description: example data for rapmap - rapid sensitive and accurate DNA read mapping
 RapMap is a testing ground for ideas in quasi-mapping / (lightweight /
 pseudo) transcriptome alignment. That means that, at this point, it is
 somewhat experimental. The develop branch will have the latest
 improvements and additions, but is not guaranteed to be stable between
 commits. Breaking changes to the master branch will be accompanied by a
 tag to the version before the breaking change. Currently, RapMap is a
 stand-alone quasi-mapper that can be used with other tools. It is also
 being used as part of Sailfish and Salmon. Eventually, the hope is to
 create and stabilize an API so that it can be used as a library from
 other tools.
 .
 This package contains example data to test this program.
