Description: Rasqal RDF query library
 Rasqal is a C library providing support for querying the
 Resource Description Framework (RDF) including
 parsing query syntaxes, constructing the queries, executing them,
 returning result bindings and formatting results.  It supports the
 SPARQL RDF Query Language, RDF Data Query Language (RDQL) and LAQRS
 experimental query language extending SPARQL.
 .
 Rasqal is designed for performance, flexibility and embedding (no
 memory leaks) and to track ongoing RDF query language work.
