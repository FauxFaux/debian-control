Description: Implementation of the WebSocket protocol for PHP
 This library implements a protocol handler for the RFC6455 (WebSocket)
 specification. It contains components for both server and client side
 handshake and messaging protocol negotiation.
 .
 Aspects that are left open to interpreation in the specification are
 also left open in this library.
 .
 The implementation is independent, framwork-agnostic and does not deal
 with I/O itself. HTTP negotiation is handled with PSR-7 interfaces.
