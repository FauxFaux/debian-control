Description: detector of conserved amino-acid sites
 Rate4Site calculates the relative evolutionary rate at each site using a
 probabilistic-based evolutionary model.
 This allows taking into account the stochastic process underlying sequence
 evolution within protein families
 and the phylogenetic tree of the proteins in the family.
 The conservation score at a site corresponds to the site's evolutionary rate.
