Description: Rational Fortran preprocessor for Fortran 77
 Ratfor77 is a preprocessor that converts the Rational Fortran dialect
 into ordinary Fortran 77. The output can then be compiled using g77
 or f2c + gcc.
 .
 The Ratfor dialect provides C-like control structures and some
 syntactic sugar that makes Fortran programs easier to read and write.
