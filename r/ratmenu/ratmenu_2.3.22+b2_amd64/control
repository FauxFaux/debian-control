Description: Creates X menus from the shell
 This is ratmenu, a simple program that allows you to create X menus from the
 shell.  Although designed for ratpoison, it will work with any ICCCM compliant
 window manager.
 .
 It was forked from 9menu version 1.5, to provide specific support
 for the ratpoison window manager.  Where 9menu only responds to the mouse, and
 ignores the keyboard, ratmenu has all mouse sensitivity taken out, and only
 responds to the keyboard.  Since then it has evolved nifty features and
 behaviors of its own.  The source code was also cleaned up and old cruft
 weeded out.
