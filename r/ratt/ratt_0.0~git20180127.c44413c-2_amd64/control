Description: Rebuild All The Things!
 ratt (“Rebuild All The Things!”) operates on a Debian .changes file of a
 just-built package, identifies all reverse-build-dependencies and rebuilds
 them with the .debs from the .changes file.
 .
 The intended use-case is, for example, to package a new snapshot of
 a Go library and verify that the new version does not break any other
 Go libraries/binaries.
