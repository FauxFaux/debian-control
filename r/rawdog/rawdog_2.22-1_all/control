Description: RSS Aggregator Without Delusions Of Grandeur
 rawdog is a feed aggregator, capable of producing a personal "river of
 news" or a public "planet" page. It supports all common feed formats,
 including all versions of RSS and Atom. By default, it is run from
 cron, collects articles from a number of feeds, and generates a static
 HTML page listing the newest articles in date order. It supports
 per-feed customizable update times, and uses ETags, Last-Modified,
 gzip compression, and RFC3229+feed to minimize network bandwidth
 usage. Its behaviour is highly customisable using plugins written in
 Python.
