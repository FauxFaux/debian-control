Description: Debian Runlevel configuration tool
 This tool configures system services in connection with system
 runlevels.  It turns on/off services using the scripts in
 /etc/init.d/.  Rcconf works with System-V style runlevel configuration.
 It is a TUI(Text User Interface) frontend to the update-rc.d command.
