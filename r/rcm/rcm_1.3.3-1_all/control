Description: tool to manage rc files (dotfiles)
 rcm is a suite of tools to manage rc files (dotfiles). The tools keep dotfiles
 in a single directory, managing symlinks to them from (or copies of them in)
 other directories. rcm supports tagging rc files and splitting them by
 hostname. It also can generate a bootstrapping script for use a new machine.
