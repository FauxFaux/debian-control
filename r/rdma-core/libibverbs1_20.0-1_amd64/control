Description: Library for direct userspace use of RDMA (InfiniBand/iWARP)
 libibverbs is a library that allows userspace processes to use RDMA
 "verbs" as described in the InfiniBand Architecture Specification and
 the RDMA Protocol Verbs Specification.  iWARP ethernet NICs support
 RDMA over hardware-offloaded TCP/IP, while InfiniBand is a
 high-throughput, low-latency networking technology.  InfiniBand host
 channel adapters (HCAs) and iWARP NICs commonly support direct
 hardware access from userspace (kernel bypass), and libibverbs
 supports this when available.
 .
 For this library to be useful, a device-specific plug-in module
 should also be installed.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
