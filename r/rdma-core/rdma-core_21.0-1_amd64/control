Description: RDMA core userspace infrastructure and documentation
 This package provides the basic boot time support for systems that use the
 Linux kernel's remote direct memory access (RDMA) subystem which includes
 InfiniBand, iWARP, and RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE).
 .
 Several kernel RDMA support daemons are included:
  - The rdma-ndd daemon which watches for RDMA device changes and/or hostname
    changes and updates the Node Description of the RDMA devices based on
    those changes.
  - The iWARP Port Mapper Daemon (iwpmd) which provides a kernel support
    service in userspace for iWARP drivers to claim TCP ports through the
    standard socket interface.
