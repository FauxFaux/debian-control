Description: utility to create a file list suitable for making backups
 rdup is a utility inspired by rsync and the plan9 way of doing
 things. rdup itself does not backup anything. It only prints a list
 of files that are changed, or all files in case of a null dump. It
 also handles files that are removed, allowing for correct incremental
 backups.
