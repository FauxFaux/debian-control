Description: Async, promise-based cache component for ReactPHP
 This library is a cache interface for ReactPHP.
 .
 The cache component provides a promise-based CacheInterface and an
 in-memory ArrayCache implementation of that.  This allows consumers to type
 hint against the interface and third parties to provide alternate
 implementations.
