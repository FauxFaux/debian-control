Description: ReactPHP's core reactor event loop for evented I/O
 This library implements a central event loop for asynchronous
 applications written in ReactPHP.
 .
 In order for async based libraries to be interoperable, they need to use
 the same event loop.  This component provides a common LoopInterface that
 any library can target.  This allows them to be used in the same loop, with
 one single run() call that is controlled by the user.
