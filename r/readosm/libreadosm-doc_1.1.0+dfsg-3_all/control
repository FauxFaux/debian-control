Description: simple library to parse OpenStreetMap files - documentation
 ReadOSM is an open source library to extract valid data from within an
 OpenStreetMap input file. Such OSM files come in two different
 formats, .osm (XML) and .pbf.
 .
 Some of the design goals of ReadOSM are:
  - to be simple and lightweight
  - to be stable, robust and efficient
  - to be easily and universally portable
  - making the whole parsing process of both .osm or .osm.pbf files
    completely transparent from the application own perspective.
 .
 This package contains the library documentation..
