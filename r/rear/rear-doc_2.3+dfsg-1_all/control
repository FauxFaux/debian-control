Description: Bare metal disaster recovery and system migration framework (documentation)
 It is a modular framework with many ready-to-go workflows for common
 situations.  Relax-and-Recover produces a bootable image. This image can
 repartition the system. Once that is done it initiates a restore from backup.
 Restores to different hardware are possible. Relax-and-Recover can therefore be
 used as a migration tool as well.
 .
 This package contains the documentation of rear.
