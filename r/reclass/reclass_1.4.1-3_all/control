Description: hierarchical inventory backend for configuration management systems
 reclass is an "external node classifier" (ENC) as can be used with automation
 tools, such as Puppet, Salt, and Ansible. It is also a stand-alone tool for
 merging data sources recursively.
 .
 The purpose of an ENC is to allow a system administrator to maintain an
 inventory of nodes to be managed, completely separately from the configuration
 of the automation tool. Usually, the external node classifier completely
 replaces the tool-specific inventory (such as site.pp for Puppet,
 ext_pillar/master_tops for Salt, or /etc/ansible/hosts).
 .
 reclass allows you to define your nodes through class inheritance, while
 always able to override details further up the tree (i.e. in more specific
 nodes). Think of classes as feature sets, as commonalities between nodes, or
 as tags. Add to that the ability to nest classes (multiple inheritance is
 allowed, well-defined, and encouraged), and piece together your infrastructure
 from smaller bits, eliminating redundancy and exposing all important
 parameters to a single location, logically organised.
 .
 This package provides the reclass CLI and adapters for Salt and Ansible.
