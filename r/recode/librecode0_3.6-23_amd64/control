Description: Shared library on which recode is based
 This recoding library converts files between various coded character
 sets and surface encodings.  The library recognizes or produces more
 than 300 different character sets and is able to convert files between
 almost any pair.  Most RFC 1345 character sets, and all `libiconv'
 character sets, are supported.
