Description: Character set conversion utility
 Free `recode' converts files between character sets and usages.  When
 exact transliterations are not possible, it may get rid of the
 offending characters or fall back on approximations.  This program
 recognizes or produces nearly 300 different character sets and is able
 to transliterate files between almost any pair.  Most RFC 1345
 character sets, and all `libiconv' character sets, are supported.
