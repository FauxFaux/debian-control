Description: Web Reconnaissance framework written in Python
 Recon-ng is a full-featured Web Reconnaissance framework written in Python.
 Complete with independent modules, database interaction, built in convenience
 functions, interactive help, and command completion, Recon-ng provides a
 powerful environment in which open source web-based reconnaissance can be
 conducted quickly and thoroughly.
 .
 Recon-ng has a look and feel similar to the Metasploit Framework, reducing the
 learning curve for leveraging the framework. However, it is quite different.
 Recon-ng is not intended to compete with existing frameworks, as it is designed
 exclusively for web-based open source reconnaissance. If you want to exploit,
 use the Metasploit Framework. If you want to Social Engineer, use the Social
 Engineer Toolkit.
