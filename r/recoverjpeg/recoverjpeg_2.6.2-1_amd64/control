Description: recover JFIF (JPEG) pictures and MOV movies
 recoverjpeg tries to recover JFIF (JPEG) pictures and MOV movies from
 a peripheral. This may be useful if you mistakenly overwrite a partition
 or if a device such as a digital camera memory card is bogus.
 .
 This package provides these executables: recoverjpeg, recovermov,
 remove-duplicates and sort-pictures. The remove-duplicates is useful to
 remove duplicate files found. sort-pictures can be used to sort pictures
 according to exif date.
 .
 This package acts as a carver (data carving) and is useful in forensics
 investigations.
