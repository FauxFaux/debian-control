Description: narrow-to-region that operates recursively
 This package defines two functions, recursive-narrow-or-widen-dwim and
 recursive-widen-dwim that replace the builtin functions narrow-to-region and
 widen. These functions operate the same way, except in the case of multiple
 calls to recursive-narrow-to-region-dwim. In this case, recursive-widen-dwim
 will go to the previous buffer visibility, not make the entire buffer visible.
