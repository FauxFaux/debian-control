Description: text-based databases called recfiles
 GNU Recutils is a set of tools and libraries
 to access human-editable, text-based databases called recfiles.
 .
 The data is stored as a sequence of records,
 each record containing an arbitrary number of named fields.
 .
 Despite its simplicity,
 recfiles can be used to store medium-sized databases.
