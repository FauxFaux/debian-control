Description: Full-text and secondary search index engine module for Redis (documentation)
 Redisearch implements a search engine on top of Redis but unlike other search
 libraries it does not use internal data structures such as sorted sets.
 .
 This also enables more advanced features such as exact phrase matching and
 numeric filtering for text queries that are not possible or efficient with
 traditional Redis search approaches.
 .
 This package contains the documentation for redisearch.
