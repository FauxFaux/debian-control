Description: Adjusts the color temperature of your screen with GTK+ integration
 The color temperature is set according to the position of the sun. A
 different color temperature is set during night and daytime. During
 twilight and early morning, the color temperature transitions smoothly
 from night to daytime temperature to allow your eyes to slowly
 adapt.
