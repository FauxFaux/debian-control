Description: extract ROM extensions
 ROM extension extractor (ree) is a tool which extracts ROM extensions
 from the firmware of a PC computer. This package also comes with fontdump,
 a program to extract the fonts from your video BIOS.
 .
 ree will scan the system memory, address c0000 - f0000 in 512 byte steps for
 identification of ROM extensions (55,aa). If found, it will calculate its
 size (byte after id, multiplied by 512byte steps) and save the output to
 a .rom file.
