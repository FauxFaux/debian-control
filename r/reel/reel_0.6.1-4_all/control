Description: Celluloid::IO-powered HTTP server
 Reel is a fast, non-blocking "evented" web server built on http_parser.rb,
 websocket_parser, Celluloid::IO, and nio4r. Thanks to Celluloid, Reel also
 works great for multithreaded applications and provides traditional
 multithreaded blocking I/O support too.
 .
 Connections to Reel can be either non-blocking and handled entirely within the
 Reel::Server thread (handling HTTP, HTTPS, or UNIX sockets), or the same
 connections can be dispatched to worker threads where they will perform
 ordinary blocking IO. Reel provides no built-in thread pool, however you can
 build one yourself using Celluloid.pool, or because Celluloid already pools
 threads to begin with, you can simply use an actor per connection.
