Description: Strict and Targeted variants of the SELinux policy
 This is the reference policy for SE Linux.  In the default configuration it
 will provide the functionality previously known as the "targeted" policy.  If
 the module "unconfined" is removed then it provides the functionality
 previously known as the "strict" policy.
 .
 This uses the MMCS system of categories.
