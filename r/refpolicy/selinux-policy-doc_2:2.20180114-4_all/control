Description: Documentation for the SELinux reference policy
 The SELinux Reference Policy (refpolicy) is a complete SELinux
 policy, as an alternative to the existing strict and targeted
 policies available from http://selinux.sf.net. The goal is to have
 this policy as the system policy, be and used as the basis for
 creating other policies. Refpolicy is based on the current strict and
 targeted policies, but aims to accomplish many additional
 goals:
  + Strong Modularity
  + Clearly stated security Goals
  + Documentation
  + Development Tool Support
  + Forward Looking
  + Configurability
  + Flexible Base Policy
  + Application Policy Variations
  + Multi-Level Security
 .
 This package contains the documentation for the reference policy.
