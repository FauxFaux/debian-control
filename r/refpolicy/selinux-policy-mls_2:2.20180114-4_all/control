Description: MLS (Multi Level Security) variant of the SELinux policy
 This is the reference policy for SE Linux built with MLS support.  It allows
 giving data labels such as "Top Secret" and preventing such data from leaking
 to processes or files with lower classification.
 .
 It was developed for Common Criteria LSPP certification for RHEL.  It will
 probably never be well supported in Debian and is only recommended for
 students who want to learn about the security features used by the military.
