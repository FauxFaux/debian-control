Description: parallel toolkit for 3D reconstructions in cryo-electron microscopy
 RELION (for REgularised LIkelihood OptimisatioN) is a stand-alone
 computer program for Maximum A Posteriori refinement of (multiple) 3D
 reconstructions or 2D class averages in cryo-electron microscopy.
 .
 RELION provides a GUI, several command-line tools in parallel (MPI) and serial
