Description: Library for Kerberos-authenticated command execution
 remctl is a client/server protocol for executing specific commands on a
 remote system with Kerberos authentication.  The allowable commands must
 be listed in a server configuration file, and the executable run on the
 server may be mapped to any command name.  Each command is also
 associated with an ACL containing a list of Kerberos principals
 authorized to run that command.
 .
 This package contains the client libraries linked against MIT Kerberos.
