Description: free implementation of Flashback game engine
 REminiscence is a free re-implementation of the game engine used to run the
 Flashback platform action game. It uses the data files from the original
 PC/DOS game and can make use of the Amiga sound files.
 .
 Flashback is a platform action game, in which you control a character that has
 lost his memory. Your task is to bring the memories back and, ultimately, save
 the world.
