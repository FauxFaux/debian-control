Description: Retrieve host and session information from remote broker servers
 This tiny Python tool is part of the Arctica Greeter display manager.
 .
 The remote-logon-config-agent fetches JSON based remote server
 information from a brokerage host (formerly known as UCCS, a service run
 by Canonical Ltd. around 2012-2014).
 .
 This tool gets used by the DBus service 'remote-logon-service'. The
 retrieved information is then handed over by the DBus service to Arctica
 Greeter.
 .
 The retrieved information can be obtained from a remote desktop
 brokerage service like Arctica Server (with brokerage support) or from
 the X2Go Session Broker.
 .
 In Arctica Greeter, the logon information is presented to the user for
 starting up remote desktop sessions on Arctica, X2Go or RDP / Citrix
 servers.
