Description: multiuser "tip"/"cu" replacement with logging
 This is Paul Vixie's rtty serial console tool. It allows runs a server
 per port which then support multiple connections at time from
 "tip"/"cu"-like clients. It also supports logging of output from the
 port, even when no client is connected. This can be invaluable for post
 mortem diagnosis of crashes of serial consoled machines.
