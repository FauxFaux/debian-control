Description: renice running processes based on regular expressions
 reniced takes a list of regular expressions, looks for processes
 matching them and renices the processes to given values.
 .
 Instead of editing the scripts in /etc/init.d to give daemons the
 nicelevel you want (and get prompted at every package update because
 these files are conffiles) you can just run reniced once a day.
