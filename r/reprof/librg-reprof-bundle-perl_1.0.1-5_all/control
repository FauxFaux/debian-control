Description: protein secondary structure and accessibility predictor (perl module)
 'reprof' is an improved implementation of 'prof', a popular protein secondary
 structure and accessibility predictor.  Prediction is either
 done from protein sequence alone or from an alignment - the latter should be
 used for optimal performance.
 .
 This package provides the perl modules implementing 'reprof' along with the
 necessary data files.
