Description: protein secondary structure and accessibility predictor
 'reprof' is an improved implementation of 'prof', a popular protein secondary
 structure and accessibility predictor.  Prediction is either
 done from protein sequence alone or from an alignment - the latter should be
 used for optimal performance.
 .
 This package provides the 'reprof' command.  It is only a command line
 interface to the functionality provided by the modules in
 librg-reprof-bundle-perl.
