Description: modules for the ReproZip packer
 ReproZip is a tool aimed at simplifying the process of creating
 reproducible experiments from command-line executions, a frequently-used
 common denominator in computational science.
 .
 It tracks operating system calls and creates a package that contains
 all the binaries, files and dependencies required to run a given
 command on the authorâ€™s computational environment (packing step). A
 reviewer can then extract the experiment in his environment to
 reproduce the results (unpacking step).
 .
 This package provides the modules for Python 3.
