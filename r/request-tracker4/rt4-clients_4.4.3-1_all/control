Description: mail gateway and command-line interface to request-tracker4
 Request Tracker (RT) is a ticketing system which
 enables a group of people to intelligently and efficiently manage
 tasks, issues, and requests submitted by a community of users. It
 features web, email, and command-line interfaces (see the package
 rt4-clients).
 .
 RT manages key tasks such as the identification, prioritization,
 assignment, resolution, and notification required by
 enterprise-critical applications, including project management, help
 desk, NOC ticketing, CRM, and software development.
 .
 This package provides the 4 series of RT. It can be installed alongside
 the 3.8 series without any problems.
 .
 This package provides support for injecting tickets into Request Tracker
 from a mail server via rt-mailgate. It may be installed onto any
 machine where you want to use the "rt" command-line interface.
