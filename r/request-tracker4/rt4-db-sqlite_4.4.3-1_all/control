Description: SQLite database backend for request-tracker4
 Request Tracker (RT) is a ticketing system which
 enables a group of people to intelligently and efficiently manage
 tasks, issues, and requests submitted by a community of users. It
 features web, email, and command-line interfaces (see the package
 rt4-clients).
 .
 RT manages key tasks such as the identification, prioritization,
 assignment, resolution, and notification required by
 enterprise-critical applications, including project management, help
 desk, NOC ticketing, CRM, and software development.
 .
 This package provides the 4 series of RT. It can be installed alongside
 the 3.8 series without any problems.
 .
 This empty package provides dependencies and dbconfig-common support for
 using Request Tracker version 4 with a local SQLite (version 3) database.
 .
 This package will be pulled in by default by request-tracker4, but SQLite
 is not recommended for production use.  Please see
 /usr/share/doc/request-tracker4/NOTES.Debian for more details and
 consider installing rt4-db-postgresql or rt4-db-mysql instead of this
 package.
