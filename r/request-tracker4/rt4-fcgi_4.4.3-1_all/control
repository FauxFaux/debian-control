Description: External FastCGI support for request-tracker4
 Request Tracker (RT) is a ticketing system which
 enables a group of people to intelligently and efficiently manage
 tasks, issues, and requests submitted by a community of users. It
 features web, email, and command-line interfaces (see the package
 rt4-clients).
 .
 RT manages key tasks such as the identification, prioritization,
 assignment, resolution, and notification required by
 enterprise-critical applications, including project management, help
 desk, NOC ticketing, CRM, and software development.
 .
 This package provides the 4 series of RT. It can be installed alongside
 the 3.8 series without any problems.
 .
 This package provides an external FCGI interface for web servers
 including, but not limited to, nginx, and is not needed for web servers
 such as Apache which invoke FCGI programs directly.
