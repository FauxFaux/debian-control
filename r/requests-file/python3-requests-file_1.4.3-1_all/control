Description: File transport adapter for Requests - Python 3.X
 Requests-File is a transport adapter for use with the Requests Python
 library to allow local filesystem access via file:// URLs.
 .
 Features:
 .
  * Will open and read local files
  * Might set a Content-Length header
  * That's about it
 .
 No encoding information is set in the response object, so be careful using
 Response.text: the chardet library will be used to convert the file to a
 unicode type and it may not detect what you actually want.
 .
 EACCES is converted to a 403 status code, and ENOENT is converted to a
 404. All other IOError types are converted to a 400.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the library.
