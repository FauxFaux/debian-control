Description: JavaScript file and module loader - NodeJS
 RequireJS loads plain JavaScript files as well as more defined
 modules. It is optimized for in-browser use, including in a Web
 Worker, but it can be used in other JavaScript environments, like
 Rhino and Node. It implements the Asynchronous Module API
 .
 RequireJS uses plain script tags to load modules/files, so it should
 allow for easy debugging. It can be used simply to load existing
 JavaScript files, so you can add it to your existing project without
 having to re-write your JavaScript files.
 .
 RequireJS includes an optimization tool you can run as part of your
 packaging steps for deploying your code. The optimization tool can
 combine and minify your JavaScript files to allow for better
 performance.
 .
 If the JavaScript file defines a JavaScript module via define(), then
 there are other benefits RequireJS can offer: improvements over
 traditional CommonJS modules and loading multiple versions of a
 module in a page. RequireJS also has a plugin system that supports
 features like i18n string bundles, and text file dependencies.
 .
 RequireJS does not have any dependencies on a JavaScript
 framework. It is dual-licensed -- new BSD or MIT.
 .
 The standard require.js file is around 5.5KB when minified via
 Closure Compiler and gzipped.
 .
 RequireJS works in IE 6+, Firefox 2+, Safari 3.2+, Chrome 3+, and
 Opera 10+.
 .
 This package also provides a script r.js, that has two major functions:
 * Run AMD-based projects in Node and Rhino.
 * Includes the RequireJS Optimizer that combines scripts for optimal
   browser delivery.
