Description: tool to launch commands and restart them on filesystem changes
 Rerun launches your program, then watches the filesystem. If a relevant file
 changes, then it restarts your program. Rerun works for both long-running
 processes (e.g. apps) and for short-running ones (e.g. tests).
 .
 Install libnotify-bin to get desktop notifications when your application is
 restarted, or about the results of your tests.
