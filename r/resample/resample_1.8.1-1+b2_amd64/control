Description: Resamples a sound file using a FIR filter
 The resample program "resamples" a soundfile to change its sampling
 rate.  For example, it can be used to convert the sampling rate from
 48 kHz (used by DAT machines) to 44.1 kHz (the standard sampling rate
 for Compact Discs).
 .
 The windowfilter program designs Finite-Impulse-Response (FIR) digital
 filters by the so-called "window method."  In this method, the ideal
 impulse response (a sinc function) is "windowed" by a Kaiser window (a
 popular window used in spectrum analysis).
