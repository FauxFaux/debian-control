Description: reSIProcate conversation manager - shared libraries
 reSIProcate is a framework that aims to fully implement the SIP protocol
 in first class C++.  It is intended for use in other applications,
 such as the repro SIP proxy.
 .
 This package provides the conversation manager library, librecon,
 implementing the core functionality of a back-to-back user agent (B2BUA),
 session border controller (SBC) and conferencing server.
 .
 As reSIProcate has no built-in media framework, this package depends on the
 media framework from the sipXtapi project.  However, it does not utilise
 any other features of sipXtapi for the session control.  Future versions of
 recon aim to support multiple media frameworks using an abstraction layer.
