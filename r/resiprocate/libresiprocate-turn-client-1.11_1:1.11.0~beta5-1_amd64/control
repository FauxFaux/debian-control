Description: reSIProcate TURN client (reTurn) - shared libraries
 reTurn is the TURN component of the reSIProcate project.
 This package provides a shared library implementing the TURN
 protocol for NAT traversal, typically used in VoIP applications
 such as SIP and Jabber/XMPP.  It is a successor to STUN and
 is an important part of the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
 protocol.
 .
 reSIProcate is a framework that aims to fully implement the SIP protocol
 in first class C++.  It is intended for use in other applications,
 such as the repro SIP proxy.
