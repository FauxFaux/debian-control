Description: reSIProcate SIP stack - ICE/TURN server
 reTurn is the TURN server developed as part of the reSIProcate project.
 TURN (RFC 5766) provides a standardised solution for VoIP applications
 to find the most efficient way to route media streams when NAT and
 firewall devices may be present.
 .
 reTurn provides a high-quality, low maintenance solution for serving
 small and large IP telephony installations.  It has been used successfully
 with a variety of SIP and Jabber applications, including Lumicall,
 Jitsi, Empathy and Psi.
 .
 reSIProcate is a framework that aims to fully implement the SIP protocol
 in first class C++.  It is intended for use in other applications,
 such as the repro SIP proxy.
