Description: web site builder using ReStructured Text as basic content format
 rest2web is a simple tool that lets you build your website from a single
 template (or as many as you want), and keep the contents in ReStructured Text
 (docutils; you can still keep pages in HTML if needed). The prefix "rest"
 does not in any way allude to the concept of "representational state
 transfer."
 .
 The tool provides a host of features, for example:
 .
  * Automatically builds index pages and navigation links (sidebars and
    breadcrumbs).
  * Aids with the translation of the site to other languages.
  * Embedded code in templates for unlimited expressiveness.
  * Flexible macro system.
  * Uses relative links, so sites can be viewed from the filesystem.
  * Uses unicode internally.
  * Built-in gallery creator plugin.
 .
 Adding new pages is as easy as dropping a text file into the right folder;
 rest2web builds the new page and adds a link to it in the index (optionally
 with a description as well). Removing a page is just as easy: delete the
 file, and when you run rest2web again it removes the entry.
