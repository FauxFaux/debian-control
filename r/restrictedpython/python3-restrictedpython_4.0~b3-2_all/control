Description: Restricted execution environment for Python 3
 RestrictedPython is a tool that helps to define a subset of the Python
 language which allows one to provide a program input into a trusted
 environment. RestrictedPython is not a sandbox system or a secured
 environment, but it helps to define a trusted environment and execute
 untrusted code inside of it.
