Description: library for GTK+ libretro frontends
 retro-gtk is a library for developers to make GTK+ frontends for the libretro
 API.
 .
 libretro is an API for the creation of games and emulators. The emulators
 and platforms are distributed as "libretro cores".
 .
 Therefore, a developer can use retro-gtk to make a gaming app that should
 be able to play any game that can be played using libretro cores.
