Description: tool to decode RFID tag data
 RFDump is a tool to decode RFID tags and show their meta information:
 tag ID, tag type, manufacturer etc. The user data memory of a tag can
 be displayed and modified using either a hex or an ASCII editor. In
 addition, the integrated cookie feature demonstrates how easy it is
 for a company to abuse RFID technology to spy on their customers.
 RFDump works with the ACG multi-tag reader or similar card reader
 hardware.
