Description: Fast RPC package for Python (and a remote console)
 rfoo (remote foo) is a fast Python RPC package which can do 160,000 RPC calls
 per second on a regular PC. It includes a fast serialization module called
 rfoo.marsh which extends the Python built in marshal module by eliminating
 serialization of code objects and protecting against bad input. The result is
 a safe to use ultra fast serializer.
 .
 Included with rfoo is rconsole, a remote Python console with auto completion,
 which can be used to inspect and modify the namespace of a running script.
