Description: development files and documentation for librgxg
 librgxg is a C library to generate (extended) regular expressions.
 .
 It can be useful to generate (extended) regular expressions to match for
 instance a specific number range (e.g. 0 to 31 or 00 to FF) or all addresses
 of a CIDR block (e.g. 192.168.0.0/24 or 2001:db8:aaaa::/64).
 .
 This package contains the development files (i.e. includes, static library,
 manual pages) that allow one to build software which uses librgxg.
