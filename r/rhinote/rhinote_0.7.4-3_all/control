Description: virtual sticky-notes for your desktop
 Rhinote is a small program that provides virtual sticky-notes. It's handy
 for jotting down quick notes or holding copied text that you plan to paste
 elsewhere later.
 .
 Notes can be saved as plain text for later viewing/editing with Rhinote or
 any other text editor.
 .
 Rhinote is designed to be "keyboard friendly", that is, every single action
 is bound to a specific keystroke.
