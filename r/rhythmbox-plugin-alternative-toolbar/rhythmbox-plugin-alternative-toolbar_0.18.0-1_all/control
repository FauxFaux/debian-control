 For non-headerbar compatible desktops, compact playcontrols toolbar is
 used which gives Rhythmbox a sleek new interface.

 New music control capabilities are provided - keyboard seek control
 through music tracks as well as repeat-one track.

 The sidebar has been given a visual reworking with new icons and
 interface that integrates Rhythmbox with other GNOME applications

 The plugins window has been revamped to give a consistent look with
 the latest GTK-3 based applications.
