Description: clean-up and beautify the list of minor-modes in Emacs' mode-line
 Rich-minority-mode is used for hiding and/or highlighting the list of
 minor-modes in the mode-line.  It is a more full-featured alternative
 to diminish.el, and supports configuration using lists and regular
 expressions by customising these three variables:
 .
 rm-blacklist: List of minor mode names that will be hidden from the
 minor-modes list. Use this to hide only a few modes that are always
 active and don’t really contribute information.
 .
 rm-whitelist: List of minor mode names that are allowed on the
 minor-modes list. Use this to hide all but a few modes.
 .
 rm-text-properties: List text properties to apply to each minor-mode
 lighter. For instance, by default Ovwrt is highlighted with a red
 face, so you always know if you’re in overwrite-mode.
