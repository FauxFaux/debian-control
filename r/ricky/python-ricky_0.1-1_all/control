Description: tool for rebuilding packages using the Debile infrastructure
 Ricky is able to create a .dsc url to your friendly local
 mirror, and fetch that exact version of the package. Ricky can then
 also use the .dsc to forge a package_version_source.changes file, and
 sign it with an autobuild key and upload it to the debile infrastructure.
