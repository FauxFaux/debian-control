Description: find algebraic equations, given their solution
 Given a number, ries searches for algebraic equations in one
 variable that have a solution (root) near that number. It avoids
 trivial or reducible solutions like ``x/x = 1''. If the input is
 an integer, ries can find an exact solution
 expressed in terms of single-digit integers.
 .
 The output gives progressively ``more complex'' equations
 that come progressively closer to matching the input number.
