Description: replacement for rifiuti, a MS Windows recycle bin analysis tool
 Rifiuti2 analyses recycle bin files from Windows. Analysis of Windows
 recycle bin is usually carried out during Windows computer forensics.
 .
 Rifiuti2 can extract file deletion time, original path and size of deleted
 files and whether the deleted files have been moved out from the recycle
 bin since they are trashed.
 .
 Rifiuti2 is a rewrite of rifiuti, which is originally written for identical
 purpose. Then it was extended to cover more functionalities, such as:
 .
   * Handles recycle bin up to Windows 10;
   * Handles ancient Windows like 95, NT4 and ME;
   * Supports all localized versions of Windows - both Unicode-based ones
     and legacy ones (using ANSI code page);
   * Supports output in XML format as well as original tab-delimited text.
 .
 Rifiuti2 is designed to be portable and runs on command line environment. Two
 programs rifiuti and rifiuti-vista are chosen depending on relevant Windows
 recycle bin format.
