Description: Clojure web applications library - servlet utilities
 Ring is a Clojure web applications library inspired by Python's WSGI
 and Ruby's Rack. By abstracting the details of HTTP into a simple,
 unified API, Ring allows web applications to be constructed of modular
 components that can be shared among a variety of applications, web
 servers, and web frameworks.
 .
 This package contains the Ring servlet utility library.
