Description: gruesomely over-featured inetd replacement
 rlinetd is designed to replace the BSD inetd. Feature-wise, it is a
 proper superset of the BSD inetd, including rpc support and both udp
 and tcp services. In addition, it supports a number of resource
 limiting features, including full resource limits a la setrlimit(2),
 renicing, chroot and limited per-service instances. To round out the
 features stolen from xinetd, it also supports binding to individual
 interfaces on request, and configurable logging.
