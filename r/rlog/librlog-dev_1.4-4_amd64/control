Description: flexible message logging library - development files
 RLog library provides a flexible message logging facility for C++ programs and
 libraries. It is meant to be fast enough to live in production code. RLog
 provides macros which are similar to Qt's debug macros, which are similar
 to simple printf() statements
 .
