Description: GUI application for generating publication quality graphs
 RLPlot is a GUI based program for displaying scientific data in
 standard formats. It has full support for all error-bar types and
 it has greater flexibility with displaying colour and texture in
 charts than gnuplot (filled bar chart boxes are possible without
 any additional programs). Output is generated on the X display where
 further changes can be made to the graph using point and click methods.
 Images can be exported as scalable vector graphics (SVG) as well as
 EPS, WMF and TIFF formats.
