Description: readline feature command line wrapper
 This package provides a small utility that uses the GNU readline library
 to allow the editing of keyboard input for any other command.  Input
 history is remembered across invocations, separately for each command;
 history completion and search work as in bash and completion word lists
 can be specified on the command line.
