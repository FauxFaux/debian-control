Description: GTK+ frontend to rmlint
 rmlint-gui (a.k.a. Shredder) is a graphical user interface to rmlint
 using GTK+. It uses rmlint to find space waste and other broken things
 on your filesystem and offers to remove them.
 .
 It is able to find:
  * Duplicate files & directories.
  * Non-stripped binaries.
  * Broken symlinks.
  * Empty files.
  * Recursive empty directories.
  * Files with broken user or group ID.
 .
 Key Features:
  * Extremely fast.
  * Flexible and easy command-line options.
  * Choice of several hashes for hash-based duplicate detection.
  * Option for exact byte-by-byte comparison (only slightly slower).
  * Numerous output options.
  * Option to store time  of last run; next time will only scan new files.
  * Many options for original selection/prioritisation.
  * Can handle very large file sets (millions of files).
