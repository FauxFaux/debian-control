Description: Fast and effective prediction of microRNA/target duplexes
 RNAhybrid is a tool for finding the minimum free energy hybridisation of a
 long and a short RNA. The hybridisation is performed in a kind of domain mode,
 ie. The short sequence is hybridised to the best fitting part of the long one.
 The tool is primarily meant as a means for microRNA target prediction.
