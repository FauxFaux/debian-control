Description: Daemon to use a Hardware TRNG
 The rngd daemon acts as a bridge between a Hardware TRNG (true random number
 generator) such as the ones in some Intel/AMD/VIA chipsets, and the kernel's
 PRNG (pseudo-random number generator).
 .
 It tests the data received from the TRNG using the FIPS 140-2 (2002-10-10)
 tests to verify that it is indeed random, and feeds the random data to the
 kernel entropy pool.
 .
 This increases the bandwidth of the /dev/random device, from a source that
 does not depend on outside activity. This may improve the behavior of systems
 which experience low values in /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
 It may also improve the quality (entropy) of the randomness of /dev/random.
 .
 A TRNG kernel module such as hw_random, or some other source of true
 entropy that is accessible as a device or fifo, is required to use this
 package. It will take advantage of the RDRAND and RDSEED instructions
 included in some Intel & AMD CPUs.
