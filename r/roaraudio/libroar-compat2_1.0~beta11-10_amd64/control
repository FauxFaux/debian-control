Description: drop-in replacements for other sound libraries
 RoarAudio is a system for audio mixing. Its main purpose is to mix audio from
 different clients before sending it to its outputs (for example a soundcard).
 It is completely network transparent (UNIX sockets, TCP/IP, DECnet) and
 supports many common codecs like Ogg Vorbis, Speex or FLAC.
 .
 To get programs which use the PulseAudio or YIFF API running, you can install
 this package and replace the appropriate libraries.
