Description: header files and documentation for the RoarAudio libraries
 RoarAudio is a server for audio mixing. Its main purpose is to mix audio from
 different clients before sending it to its outputs (for example a soundcard).
 It is completely network transparent (UNIX sockets, TCP/IP, DECnet) and
 supports many common codecs like Ogg Vorbis, Speex or FLAC.
 .
 This packet consists of the following libraries:
 libroar: The RoarAudio main library. It contains code for talking to roard,
 virtual IO functions useful not only for audio applications, memory
 management functions like buffers, lists, stacks.
 .
 libroardsp: Digital Signal Processing library. It contains code to work with
 PCM signals including simple filters, converters and code to work with some
 (realtime) codecs.
 .
 libroareio: This is the RoarAudio Extended IO library. It contains code for
 talking to extended IO. Currently it contains code to talk to soundcards
 without roard. This is not meant to be used by other applications directly.
 .
 libroarlight: Light Control support library. It contains code to support
 the usage of the light control subsystem.
 .
 libroarmidi: MIDI subsystem support library. It contains code to support
 the usage of the MIDI subsystem.
 .
 This package contains the development headers for the libroar library.
