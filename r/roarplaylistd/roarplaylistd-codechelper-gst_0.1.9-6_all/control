Description: roarplaylistd helper script for GStreamer codecs
 RoarAudio PlayList Daemon is a audio player backend daemon
 handling playlists. It stores playlists and plays files
 using RoarAudio as audio backend.

 The daemon can be controlled using a simple protocol.
 It can listen on UNIX and TCP sockets.

 File formats and codecs not supported by RoarAudio
 can be handled by using a helper program.

 This helper script is used for roarplaylistd to play additional codecs
