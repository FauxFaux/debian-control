Description: Function wrapper library for Clojure
 Robert Hooke is a Clojure library that provides a flexible, composable
 mechanism to extend functions after they have been defined.
 .
 Hooks can be used to change the behaviour of the functions they wrap in many
 ways, for example:
 .
  * conditional execution
  * modify arguments
  * add side effects
  * return different values
 .
 Hooke is inspired by Emacs Lisp's defadvice and clojure.test fixtures.
