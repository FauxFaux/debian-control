Description: C++ implementation of a fast hash map and hash set
 The robin-map library is a C++ implementation of a fast hash map and
 hash set using open-addressing and linear robin hood hashing with
 backward shift deletion to resolve collisions.
 .
 Four classes are provided: tsl::robin_map, tsl::robin_set,
 tsl::robin_pg_map and  tsl::robin_pg_set.
 The first two are faster and use a power of two growth policy,
 the last two use a prime growth policy instead and are able to cope
 better with a poor hash function.
 Use the prime version if there is a chance of repeating patterns in
 the lower bits of your hash (e.g. you are storing pointers with an
 identity hash function).
