Description: bridge between IRC and RobustIRC
 The RobustIRC bridge allows you to connect to a RobustIRC network using your
 regular IRC client (such as irssi, WeeChat, XChat, etc).
 .
 It can be used as a SOCKS proxy for IRC clients which support SOCKS proxies,
 or it can be run for a specific RobustIRC network, in which case it will
 listen on a port (localhost:6667 by default) and talk IRC.
