Description: persistent Key-Value Store for Flash and RAM Storage (development)
 C++ library providing an embedded key-value store, where keys and values are
 arbitrary byte streams. It was developed at Facebook based on LevelDB and
 provides backwards-compatible support for LevelDB APIs.
 .
 RocksDB is optimized for Flash with extremely low latencies. RocksDB uses a
 Log Structured Database Engine for storage, written entirely in C++.
 .
 RocksDB features highly flexible configuration settings that may be tuned to
 run on a variety of production environments, including pure memory, Flash,
 hard disks or HDFS. It supports various compression algorithms and good tools
 for production support and debugging.
 .
 Features:
   - Designed for application servers wanting to store up to a few terabytes
     of data on locally attached Flash drives or in RAM
   - Optimized for storing small to medium size key-values on fast storage --
     flash devices or in-memory
   - Scales linearly with number of CPUs so that it works well on ARM
     processors
 .
 This package contains libraries and header files for developing
 applications that use librocksdb .
