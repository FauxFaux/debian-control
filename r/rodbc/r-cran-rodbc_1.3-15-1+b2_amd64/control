Description: GNU R package for ODBC database access
 This CRAN package provides access to any Open DataBase Connectivity (ODBC)
 accessible database.
 .
 The package should be platform independent and provide access to any
 database for which a driver exists.  It has been tested with MySQL
 and PostgreSQL on both Linux and Windows (and to those DBMSs on Linux
 hosts from R under Windows), Microsoft Access, SQL Server and Excel
 spreadsheets (read-only), and users have reported success with
 connections to Oracle and DBase.
 .
 Usage is covered in the R Data Import/Export manual (available via the
 r-doc-pdf, r-doc-html and r-doc-info packages).
