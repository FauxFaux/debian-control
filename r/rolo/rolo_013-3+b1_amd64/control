Description: text-based (vCard) contact management software
 Rolo keeps track of your contacts and display them to you with a
 text-based menu. Rolo strives to be a well-constructed tool for
 complimenting text-based email programs-such as mutt. It utilizes the
 vCard version 3.0 format for storing its contacts and it interfaces
 with the end-user through a NCurses front-end.
