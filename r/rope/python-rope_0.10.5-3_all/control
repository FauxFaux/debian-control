Description: Python 2 refactoring library
 Rope is a Python refactoring library that can be used with several editors
 and IDEs. It provides many refactoring operations as well as forms of code
 assistance like auto-completion and access to documentation. To make use of
 refactoring in Mercurial, Git and Svn repositories, the recommended packages
 must be installed. For a complete list of features, see the project homepage.
 .
 In Debian, this package is used by the Python-ropemacs package, an Emacs mode
 that adds Python refactoring and IDE features to the Emacs editor.
 .
 This provides the Python 2 version of the library.
