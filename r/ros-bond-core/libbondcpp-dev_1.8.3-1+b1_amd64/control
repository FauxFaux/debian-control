Description: Development files for Robot OS bondcpp library
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). It is the 'bond' process state
 machine library C++ implementation development files.
 .
 Bond is a mechanism for checking when another process has
 terminated. A bond allows two processes, A and B, to know when the
 other has terminated, either cleanly or by crashing. The bond remains
 connected until it is either broken explicitly or until a heartbeat
 times out.
