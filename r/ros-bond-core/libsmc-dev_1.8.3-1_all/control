Description: Robot OS 'bond' State Machine Compiler interface
 The State Machine Compiler (SMC) from http://smc.sourceforge.net/
 converts a language-independent description of a state machine
 into the source code to support that state machine.
 .
 This package contains the libraries that a compiled state machine
 depends on, but it does not contain the compiler itself.
