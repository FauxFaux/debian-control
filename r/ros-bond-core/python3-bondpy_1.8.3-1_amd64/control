Description: Python 3 implementation of bond
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). It is the 'bond' process state
 machine library Python 3 implementation.
 .
 Bond is a mechanism for checking when another process has terminated. A
 bond allows two processes, A and B, to know when the other has terminated,
 either cleanly or by crashing. The bond remains connected until it is either
 broken explicitly or until a heartbeat times out. This package contains
 the Python 3 package.
