Description: development files for Robot OS class_loader library
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). The class_loader package is a
 ROS-independent package for loading plugins during runtime and the
 foundation of the higher level ROS "pluginlib" library.  class_loader
 utilizes the host operating system's runtime loader to open runtime
 libraries (e.g. .so/.dll files), introspect the library for exported
 plugin classes, and allows users to instantiate objects of said
 exported classes without the explicit declaration (i.e. header file)
 for those classes.
 .
 This package contains the development files for the library.
