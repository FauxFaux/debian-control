Description: Robot OS conversion library between tf and Eigen and KDL
 This package contains a set of conversion functions to convert
 common tf datatypes (point, vector, pose, etc) into semantically
 identical datatypes used by other libraries. The conversion functions
 make it easier for users of the transform library (tf) to work with
 the datatype of their choice. Currently this package has support for
 the Kinematics and Dynamics Library (KDL) and the Eigen matrix library.
 .
 This package contains the library itself and is part of Robot OS (ROS).
