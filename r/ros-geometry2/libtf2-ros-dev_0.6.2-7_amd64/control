Description: Robot OS binding for tf2 transform library - dev files
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). tf2 is the second generation
 of the transform library, which lets the user keep track of multiple
 coordinate frames over time. tf2 maintains the relationship between
 coordinate frames in a tree structure buffered in time, and lets the
 user transform points, vectors, etc between any two coordinate frames
 at any desired point in time.
 .
 This package contains the development files of the ROS binding to tf2.
