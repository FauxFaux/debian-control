Description: Robot OS random numbers library
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). It contains a library which
 provides wrappers for generating floating point values, integers,
 and quaternions using boost libraries. The constructor of the wrapper is
 guaranteed to be thread safe and initialize its random number generator to a
 random seed. Seeds are obtained using a separate and different random number
 generator.
 .
 This package contains the library itself.
