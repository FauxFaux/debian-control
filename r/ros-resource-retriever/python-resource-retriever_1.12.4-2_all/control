Description: Robot OS resource_retriever library - Python 2
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). It retrieves data from
 url-format files such as http://, ftp://, package:// file://, etc.,
 and loads the data into memory. The package:// url for ros packages
 is translated into a local file:// url. The resource retriever was
 initially designed to load mesh files into memory, but it can be used
 for any type of data. The resource retriever is based on the libcurl library.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 binding.
