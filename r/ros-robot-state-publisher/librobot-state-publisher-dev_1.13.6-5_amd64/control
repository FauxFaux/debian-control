Description: development files for Robot OS robot_state_publisher library
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). This package allows you to publish the
 state of a robot to tf. Once the state gets published, it is available to all
 components in the system that also use tf. The package takes the joint angles
 of the robot as input and publishes the 3D poses of the robot links, using a
 kinematic tree model of the robot.
 .
 This package contains the development files for the library.
