Description: Development files for rostest (Robot OS)
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). It contains the development
 files for the rostest framework. It's an extension that enables
 roslaunch files to be used as test fixtures. As a fully running
 system has more complex behaviors than an individual ROS node,
 this allows you to do full integration testing across multiple
 nodes. It is compatible with xUnit frameworks.
