Description: development files for Robot OS libxmlrpcpp
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). It contains the development
 files for the XmlRpc++ library, which is a C++ implementation of the XML-RPC
 protocol. This version is heavily modified from the package available
 on SourceForge in order to support roscpp's threading model. As such,
 it's a maintained fork by OSRF.
