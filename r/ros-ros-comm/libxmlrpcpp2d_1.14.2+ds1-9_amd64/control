Description: Robot OS version of xml-rpc protocol library
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). It contains the XmlRpc++
 library, which is a C++ implementation of the XML-RPC protocol. This
 version is heavily modified from the package available on SourceForge
 in order to support roscpp's threading model. As such, it's a
 maintained fork by OSRF.
