Description: Python 2 client library for Robot OS
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). The rospy client API enables
 Python programmers to quickly interface with ROS topics, services,
 and parameters. The design of rospy favors implementation speed
 (i.e. developer time) over runtime performance so that algorithms can
 be quickly prototyped and tested within ROS. It is also ideal for
 non-critical-path code, such as configuration and initialization
 code. Many of the ROS tools are written in rospy to take advantage of
 the type introspection capabilities.
 .
 Many of the ROS tools, such as rostopic and rosservice, are built on
 top of rospy.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 library.
