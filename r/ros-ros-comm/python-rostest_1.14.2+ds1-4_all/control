Description: Test suite for Robot OS based on roslaunch
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). rostest is an extension to
 roslaunch that enables roslaunch files to be used as test
 fixtures. As a fully running system has more complex behaviors than
 an individual ROS node, this allows you to do full integration
 testing across multiple nodes. It is compatible with xUnit
 frameworks.
