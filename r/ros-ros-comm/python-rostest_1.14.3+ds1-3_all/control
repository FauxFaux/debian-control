Description: Test suite for Robot OS based on roslaunch - Python 2
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). rostest is an extension to
 roslaunch that enables roslaunch files to be used as test
 fixtures. As a fully running system has more complex behaviors than
 an individual ROS node, this allows you to do full integration
 testing across multiple nodes. It is compatible with xUnit
 frameworks.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 library.
