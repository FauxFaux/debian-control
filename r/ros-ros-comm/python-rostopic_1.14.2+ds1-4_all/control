Description: Command-line tool for displaying debug information about Robot OS Topics
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). This tool helps debugging by
 showing debug information about ROS Topics, including publishers,
 subscribers, publishing rate, and ROS Messages. It also contains an
 experimental Python library for getting information about, and
 interacting with, topics dynamically. This library is for internal use
 only as the code API may change, though it does provide examples of
 how to implement dynamic subscription and publication behaviors in
 ROS.
