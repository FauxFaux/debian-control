Description: Tools for messing with Robot OS topics
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). It contains tools for directing,
 throttling, selecting, and otherwise messing with ROS topics at a
 meta level. None of the programs in this package actually know about
 the topics whose streams they are altering; instead, these tools deal
 with messages as generic binary blobs. This means they can be applied
 to any ROS topic.
