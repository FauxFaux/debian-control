Description: Robot OS empty package template creator (Python 2)))))))))
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). It provides roscreate-pkg
 which creates empty ROS package templates and thus addresses the
 common problem of packages being created using pre-existing packages,
 which leads to errors in build files and manifests. The tool creates a
 new package directory, including the appropriate build and manifest
 files.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 library.
