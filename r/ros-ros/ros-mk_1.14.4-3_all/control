Description: Robot OS make file helpers
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). It is a collection of make
 include files for building ROS architectural elements.  Most package
 authors should use cmake.mk, which calls CMake for the build of the
 package. The other files in this package are intended for use in
 exotic situations that mostly arise when importing 3rdparty code.
