Description: Assorted shell commands for using Robot OS with bash
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). The rosbash package contains
 some useful bash functions and adds tab-completion to a large number
 of the basic ros utilities. The package includes limited support for
 zsh and tcsh by way of sourcing the roszsh or rostcsh files
 respectively. It doesn't provide documentation on these shells,
 though much of the functionality is similar to the bash shell
 extensions.
