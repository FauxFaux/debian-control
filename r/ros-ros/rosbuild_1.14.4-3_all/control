Description: scripts for managing the Robot OS build system
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). Rosbuild solves the core
 problem of gathering appropriate build flags from, and tracking
 dependencies in, the ROS package tree. The macros provided by
 rosbuild automatically inherit the union of build flags exported by
 packages on which your package depends.
