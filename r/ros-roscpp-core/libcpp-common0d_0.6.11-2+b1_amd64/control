Description: Robot OS utility library
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). It contains the C++ library
 libcpp_common which is code for doing things that are not necessarily ROS
 related, but are useful for multiple packages. This includes things like the
 ROS_DEPRECATED and ROS_FORCE_INLINE macros, as well as code for getting
 backtraces.
