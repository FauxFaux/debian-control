Description: image_geometry Robot OS package - development
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). It contains libraries for interpreting
 images geometrically. It interfaces the calibration parameters in
 sensor_msgs/CameraInfo messages with OpenCV functions such as
 image rectification, much as cv_bridge interfaces ROS sensor_msgs/Image with
 OpenCV data types.
 .
 This package contains the C++ development library.
