Description: Commands to manage multi-VCS repositories (for Robot OS) Python 3
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). It provides commands to
 manage several local VCS repositories based on a single workspace
 definition file (.rosinstall). Git, Mercurial, Subversion, and Bazaar
 are supported.
 .
 wstool replaces the rosws tool for catkin workspaces. As catkin
 workspaces create their own setup file and environment, wstool is
 reduced to version control functions only. So wstool does not have a
 "regenerate" command, and does not allow adding non-version
 controlled elements to workspaces. In all other respects, it behaves
 the same as rosws.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
