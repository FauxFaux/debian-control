Description: text-based light-weight frontend for update-alternatives
 Rover is a text-based light-weight frontend for update-alternatives, which is
 inspired by the ranger file browser. Compared to existing graphical frontends
 such as galternatives and kalternatives, Rover still has the following
 advantages:
   1. User doesn't need to move hand off the keyboard.
   2. Zero GUI overhead, and not bound to graphical environment.
   3. Supports searching by substring or Python regex.
