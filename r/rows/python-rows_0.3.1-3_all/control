Description: library to tabular data, no matter the format
 No matter in which format your tabular data is: python-rows will import it,
 automatically detect types and give you high-level Python objects so you can
 start working with the data instead of trying to parse it.
 It is also locale and unicode aware.
 .
 The library is composed by:
 .
  * A common interface to tabular data (the Table class).
  * A set of plugins to populate Table objects CSV, XLS, HTML, TXT.
  * A set of common fields (such as BoolField, IntegerField) which know exactly
    how to serialize and deserialize data for each object type you'll get.
  * A set of utilities (such as field type recognition) to help working with
    tabular data.
  * Access to the most used features: convert between formats, sum, join and
    sort tables. Just import rows and relax.
Python-Version: 2.7
