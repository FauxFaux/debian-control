Description: common, beautiful interface to tabular data, no matter the format
 A command-line interface so you can have easy access to the most used
 features: convert between formats, sum, join and sort tables.
 No matter in which format your tabular data is: rows will import it,
 automatically detect types so you can start working with the data instead of
 trying to parse it. It is also locale and unicode aware.
