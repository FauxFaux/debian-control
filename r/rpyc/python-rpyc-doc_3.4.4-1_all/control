Description: transparent and symmetric Remote Python Call library -- documentation
 RPyC (pronounced as are-pie-see), or Remote Python Call, is a transparent
 Python library for symmetrical remote procedure calls, clustering and
 distributed-computing. RPyC makes use of object-proxying, a technique that
 employs Pythonâ€™s dynamic nature, to overcome the physical boundaries between
 processes and computers, so that remote objects can be manipulated as if they
 were local.
 .
 This package provides the documentation.
