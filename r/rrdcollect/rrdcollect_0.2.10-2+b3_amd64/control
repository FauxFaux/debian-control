Description: Round-Robin-Database Collecting Daemon
 RRDcollect is a daemon which polls certain files in /proc/
 directory, gathering data and storing it inside RRDtool's
 database files.  Being written in C it should be both fast
 and resources-friendly.  It supports both scanf(3)-style
 pattern matches and perl compatible regular expressions.
 .
 This package does not create rrd files. You need to create those files
 manually using rrdtool package.
