Description: data caching daemon for RRDtool
 RRDCacheD is a daemon that receives updates to existing RRD files, accumulates
 them and, if enough have been received or a defined time has passed, writes
 the updates to the RRD file. The daemon was written with big setups in mind.
 Those setups usually run into I/O related problems. RRDCacheD's goal is to
 alleviate these problems.
