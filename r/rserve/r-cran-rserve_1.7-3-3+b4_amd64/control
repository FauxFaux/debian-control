Description: GNU R Rserve tcp/ip server and sample clients
 This package provide Rserve, a headless server for GNU R.  Rserve
 acts as a socket server (TCP/IP or local sockets) which allows binary
 requests to be sent to R. Every connection has a separate workspace
 and working directory. Client-side implementations are available for
 popular languages such as C/C++ and Java, allowing any application to
 use facilities of R without the need of linking to R code. Rserve
 supports remote connection, user authentication and file transfer. A
 simple R client is included in this package as well.
