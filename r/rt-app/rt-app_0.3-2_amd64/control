Description: Test application which simulates a real-time periodic load
 rt-app is a test application that starts multiple periodic threads in
 order to simulate a real-time periodic load. It supports the
 SCHED_OTHER/SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR kernel mechanisms as well as the
 AQuoSA framework and SCHED_DEADLINE. It can be run with a simple
 command-line config, or a more complex set of tasks/threads
 configured in a (json) config file.
