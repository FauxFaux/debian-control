Description: Calendar view for Request Tracker 4
 This RT extension provides a calendar view for your tickets and your
 reminders so you see when is your next due ticket. You can find it in the
 menu Search->Calendar.
 .
 There's a portlet to put on your home page (see Prefs/MyRT.html)
 .
 You can also enable ics (ICal) feeds for your default calendar and all your
 private searches in Prefs/Calendar.html. Authentication is magic number based
 so that you can give those feeds to other people.
