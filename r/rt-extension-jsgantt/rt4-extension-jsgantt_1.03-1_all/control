Description: Gantt charts for your tickets (for RT4)
 Gantt charts are ubiquitous for project planning and management.
 This extension provides dynamically generated Gantt charts for
 any ticket search in RT using the date fields for each ticket.
 It also provides a Gantt chart for the dependencies of a ticket
 so you can see how your entire project fits together.
