Description: Repeat tickets in Request Tracker 4 based on schedule
 The RepeatTicket extension for the Request Tracker trouble-ticket tracking
 system allows you to set up recurring tickets so new tickets are
 automatically created based on a schedule. The new tickets are populated
 with the subject and initial content of the original ticket in the
 recurrence.
 .
 After you activate the plugin by adding it to your RT_SiteConfig.pm file, all
 tickets will have a Recurrence tab on the create and edit pages. To set up a
 repeating ticket, click the checkbox to "Enable Recurrence" and fill out the
 schedule for the new tickets.
 .
 New tickets are created when you initially save the recurrence, if new
 tickets are needed, and when your daily cron job runs the rt-repeat-ticket
 script.
