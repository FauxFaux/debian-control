Description: C++ library for realtime audio input/ouput (documentation files)
 RtAudio is a set of C++ classes that provides a common API (Application
 Programming Interface) for realtime audio input/output across Linux
 (native ALSA, JACK, and OSS), Macintosh OS X, SGI, and Windows
 (DirectSound and ASIO) operating systems. RtAudio significantly
 simplifies the process of interacting with computer audio hardware.
