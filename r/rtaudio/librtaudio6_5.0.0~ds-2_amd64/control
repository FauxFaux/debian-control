Description: C++ library for realtime audio input/ouput
 RtAudio is a set of C++ classes that provides a common API (Application
 Programming Interface) for realtime audio input/output across Linux
 (native ALSA, JACK, and OSS), Macintosh OS X, SGI, and Windows
 (DirectSound and ASIO) operating systems. RtAudio significantly
 simplifies the process of interacting with computer audio hardware. It
 was designed with the following objectives:
 .
  * object-oriented C++ design
  * simple, common API across all supported platforms
  * only one source and two header files for easy inclusion in
    programming projects
  * allow simultaneous multi-api support
  * support dynamic connection of devices
  * provide extensive audio device parameter control
  * allow audio device capability probing
  * automatic internal conversion for data format, channel number
    compensation, (de)interleaving, and byte-swapping
 .
 RtAudio incorporates the concept of audio streams, which represent audio
 output (playback) and/or input (recording). Available audio devices and
 their capabilities can be enumerated and then specified when opening a
 stream.
 .
 This package provides the shared library.
