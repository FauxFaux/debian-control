Description: Classification of sequence reads of 16S ribosomal RNA gene
 Short-read technologies for microbial community profiling are increasingly
 popular, yet previous techniques for assigning taxonomy to paired-end reads
 perform poorly. RTAX provides rapid taxonomic assignments of paired-end
 reads using a consensus algorithm.
