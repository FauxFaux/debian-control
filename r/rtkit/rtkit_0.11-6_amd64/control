Description: Realtime Policy and Watchdog Daemon
 RealtimeKit is a D-Bus system service that changes the
 scheduling policy of user processes/threads to SCHED_RR
 (i.e. realtime scheduling mode) on request. It is intended to
 be used as a secure mechanism to allow real-time scheduling to
 be used by normal user processes.
