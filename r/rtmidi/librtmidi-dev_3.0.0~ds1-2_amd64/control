Description: C++ library for realtime MIDI input/ouput (development files)
 RtMidi is a set of C++ classes that provides a common API (Application
 Programming Interface) for realtime MIDI input/output across Linux
 (native ALSA, JACK, and OSS), Macintosh OS X, SGI, and Windows
 (DirectSound and ASIO) operating systems. RtMidi significantly
 simplifies the process of interacting with computer audio hardware.
