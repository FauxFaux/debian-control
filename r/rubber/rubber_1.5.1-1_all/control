Description: automated system for building LaTeX documents
 This is a building system for LaTeX documents. It is based on a routine that
 runs just as many compilations as necessary. The module system provides a
 great flexibility that virtually allows support for any package with no user
 intervention, as well as pre- and post-processing of the document. The
 standard modules currently provide support for bibtex, dvips, dvipdfm,
 pdftex, makeindex. A good number of standard packages are supported,
 including graphics/graphicx with automatic conversion between various
 graphics formats and Metapost compilation.
 .
 Some optional parts require the installation of suggested Debian packages:
 imagemagick (graphics conversion),
 r-cran-knitr,
 texlive-bibtex-extra (biblatex),
 texlive-binaries (aleph),
 texlive-latex-extra (cweb, minitoc, moreverb, multibib, nomencl, ntheorem),
 texlive-latex-recommended (beamer, index, listings),
 texlive-pictures (gnuplottex),
 transfig (conversion from XFig format).
 .
 pythontex from texlive-extra-utils requires
 either python3-prompt-toolkit and python3-pygments,
 or python-prompt-toolkit and python-pygments for Python2 code.
