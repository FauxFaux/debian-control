Description: Vamp plugins using Rubber Band
 Rubber Band is a library and utility program that permits you to
 change the tempo and pitch of an audio recording independently of one
 another.
 .
 This package contains the following Vamp plugins:
 .
  * increments (Output Increments): Output time increment for each
    input step
 .
  * aggregate_increments (Accumulated Output Increments): Accumulated
    output time increments
 .
  * divergence (Divergence from Linear): Difference between actual
    output time and the output time for a theoretical linear stretch
 .
  * phaseresetdf (Phase Reset Detection Function): Curve whose peaks
    are used to identify transients for phase reset points
 .
  * smoothedphaseresetdf (Smoothed Phase Reset Detection Function):
    Phase reset curve smoothed for peak picking
 .
  * phaseresetpoints (Phase Reset Points): Points estimated as
    transients at which phase reset occurs
 .
  * timesyncpoints (Time Sync Points): Salient points which stretcher
    aims to place with strictly correct timing
