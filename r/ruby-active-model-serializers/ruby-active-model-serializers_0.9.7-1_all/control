Description: Making it easy to serialize models for client-side use
 Bringing consistency and object orientation to model serialization. Works
 great for client-side MVC frameworks! ActiveModel::Serializers brings
 convention over configuration to your JSON generation. AMS does this through
 two components: serializers and adapters. Serializers describe which
 attributes and relationships should be serialized. Adapters describe how
 attributes and relationships should be serialized.
