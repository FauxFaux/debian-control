Description: ActiveLdap is a object-oriented API to LDAP
 'ActiveLdap' is a ruby extension library which provides a clean
 objected oriented interface to the Ruby/LDAP library.  It was inspired
 by ActiveRecord. This is not nearly as clean or as flexible as
 ActiveRecord, but it is still trivial to define new objects and manipulate
 them with minimal difficulty.
