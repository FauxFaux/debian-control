Description: makes creating XML/JSON responses in Rails 3 easy and fun
 It provides a simple interface to determine the representation of your
 model data, that should be rendered in your API responses.
 .
 In addition to Rails it theoretically can be used with any ruby app and
 any database (__ActiveRecord__ and __Mongoid__ are supported out of the
 box) as it only has few dependencies.
 .
 The lib is _very_ fast in generating your responses and battle tested in
 production with platforms like Diaspora or flinc.
