Description: provides advanced tagging for Rails
 With ActsAsTaggableOn, you can tag a single model on several contexts, such as
 skills, interests, and awards. It also provides other advanced functionality.
 .
 This plugin was originally based on Acts as Taggable on Steroids by Jonathan
 Viney. Rather than tying functionality to a specific keyword (namely `tags`),
 acts as taggable on allows you to specify an arbitrary number of tag
 "contexts" that can be used locally or in combination in the same way steroids
 was used.
