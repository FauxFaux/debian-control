Description: Ruby class for accumulating aggregate statistics
 Aggregate is an intuitive ruby implementation of a statistics aggregator
 including both default and configurable histogram support. It does this
 without recording/storing any of the actual sample values, making it
 suitable for tracking statistics across millions/billions of samples
 without any impact on performance or memory footprint. Originally
 inspired by the Aggregate support in SystemTap.
