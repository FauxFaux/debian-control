Description: feature-rich, asynchronous AMQP client
 AMQP is an open standard for messaging middleware that emphasizes
 interoperability between different technologies (for example, Java,
 Ruby, Python, .NET, Node.js, Erlang, C and so on).
 .
 Key features of AMQP are very flexible yet simple routing and binary
 protocol efficiency. AMQP supports many sophisticated features, for
 example, message acknowledgements, returning of messages to producer,
 redelivery of messages that couldn't be processed, load balancing
 between message consumers and so on.
 .
 This package contains a ruby client for AMQP.
