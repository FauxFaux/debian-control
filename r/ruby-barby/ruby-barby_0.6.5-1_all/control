Description: Ruby library for barcode generation
 This is a pure-Ruby library for generating various kinds of barcodes,
 including all the standard 1D and 2D barcodes, and meant to be easily
 extensible.
 .
 Barby separates the concerns of barcode generation and graphical
 representations, so not only the barcodes' format can be extended,
 but also the way they are output.
