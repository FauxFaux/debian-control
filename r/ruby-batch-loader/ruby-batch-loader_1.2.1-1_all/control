Description: Powerful tool to avoid N+1 DB or HTTP queries
 This library provides a generic lazy batching mechanism to avoid N+1 DB
 queries, HTTP queries, etc.
 .
 Highlights
  * Generic utility to avoid N+1 DB queries, HTTP requests, etc.
  * Adapted Ruby implementation of battle-tested tools like Haskell Haxl, JS
    DataLoader, etc.
  * Batching is isolated and lazy, load data in batch where and when it's
    needed.
  * Automatically caches previous queries (identity map).
  * Thread-safe (`loader`).
  * No need to share batching through variables or custom defined classes.
  * No dependencies, no monkey-patches, no extra primitives such as Promises.
