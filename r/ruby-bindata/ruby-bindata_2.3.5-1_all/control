Description: declarative way to read and write binary file formats
 BinData is a declarative way to read and write binary file formats.
 .
 This means the programmer specifies *what* the format of the binary
 data is, and BinData works out *how* to read and write data in this
 format.  It is an easier ( and more readable ) alternative to
 ruby's #pack and #unpack methods.
