Description: extracts token delimited entities from a sequence of arbitrary inputs
 Statefully split input data by a specifiable token
 .
 BufferedTokenizer takes a delimiter upon instantiation, or acts line-based by
 default.  It allows input to be spoon-fed from some outside source which
 receives arbitrary length datagrams which may-or-may-not contain the token by
 which entities are delimited.  In this respect it's ideally paired with
 something like EventMachine.
