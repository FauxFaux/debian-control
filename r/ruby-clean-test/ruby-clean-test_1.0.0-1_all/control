Description: Get unit tests readable and fluent
 This library is a set of small, simple tools to make your Test::Unit test cases
 easy to understand. This isn't a massive change in how you write tests, but
 simply some helpful things will make your tests easier to read.
 .
 The main problems this library solves are: understanding what part of a test
 method is setup, test, and evaluation; understanding what elements of a test
 are relevant to the test, and which are arbitrary placeholders; removing the
 requirement that your tests are method names.
