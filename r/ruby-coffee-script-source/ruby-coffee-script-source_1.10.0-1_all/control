Description: CoffeeScript Compiler - Ruby integration
 CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.
 Underneath all of those embarrassing braces and semicolons,
 JavaScript has always had a gorgeous object model at its heart.
 CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript
 in a simple way.
 .
 This package provides an abstraction of the actual location of the
 CoffeeScript compiler for use by other Ruby packages, e.g. ruby-coffee-script.
