Description: Flexible configuration system for Ruby
 Configurate for Ruby allows one to specify a chain of configuration
 providers which are queried in order until one of them returns a value.
 This allows scenarios like overiding settings one's default settings with
 a user configuration file and let those be overidden by environment variables.
 The query interface allows one to group and nest the configuration options
 to a pratically unlimited level.
