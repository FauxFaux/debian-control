Description: core library for the Cucumber application
 Cucumber lets software development teams describe how software should behave
 in plain text. The text is written in a business-readable domain-specific
 language and serves as documentation, automated tests and development-aid -
 all rolled into one format.
 .
 This package provides the core library for the Cucumber application.
 It contains the core domain logic to execute Cucumber features. It has no user
 interface, just a Ruby API. It can be used to build other tools that work with
 Gherkin documents.
