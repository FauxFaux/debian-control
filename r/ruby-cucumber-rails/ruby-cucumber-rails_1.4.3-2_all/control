Description: cucumber integration for Rails applications
 Cucumber lets software development teams describe how software should behave
 in plain text. The text is written in a business-readable domain-specific
 language and serves as documentation, automated tests and development-aid -
 all rolled into one format.
 .
 This package provides cucumber integration for Rails applications in a way
 that it's easy to get started.
