Description: migrate data alongside schema changes for rake tasks
 This data_migrate gem provides data migrations alongside schema
 migrations for rake tasks.
 .
 Data migrations are stored in db/data. They act like schema migrations,
 except they should be reserved for data migrations.
 .
 For instance, if you realize you need to titleize all yours titles,
 this is the place to do it. Running any of the provided rake tasks
 also creates a data schema table to mirror the usual schema migrations
 table to track all the goodness.
