Description: Ruby binding for D-Bus
 This module allows Ruby programs to interface with the D-Bus message
 bus installed on newer Unix operating systems.
 .
 Ruby D-Bus currently supports the following features:
   * Connecting to local buses.
   * Accessing remote services, objects and interfaces.
   * Invoking methods on remote objects synchronously and asynchronously.
   * Catch signals on remote objects and handle them via callbacks.
   * Remote object introspection.
   * Walking object trees.
   * Creating services and registering them on the bus.
   * Exporting objects with interfaces on a bus for remote use.
   * Rubyish D-Bus object and interface syntax support that automatically
     allows for introspection.
   * Emitting signals on exported objects.
