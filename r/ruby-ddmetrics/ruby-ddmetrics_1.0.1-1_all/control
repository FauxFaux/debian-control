Description: Non-timeseries measurements for Ruby programs
 DDMetrics is a Ruby library for recording and analysing measurements in
 short-running Ruby processes.
 .
 Metrics are not recorded over time, and the time series are not available.
 Metrics data (particularly summary metrics) can accumulate in memory and cause
 memory pressure. This project is not suited for long-running processes, such as
 servers. The implementation is not thread-safe.
