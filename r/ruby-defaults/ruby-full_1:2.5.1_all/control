Description: Ruby full installation (default version)
 For many good reasons, the Ruby programming language is split in many
 small different packages. Installing this package will make sure you have
 all the packages that add up to a full Ruby installation, with the exception
 of the Tcl/Tk bindings for Ruby, which are only recommended.
 .
 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default Ruby
 version (currently v2.5).
