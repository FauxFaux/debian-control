Description: Similar to ruby-memoize, but for mutable and parameterizable objects
 The dirty-memoize library can help making your program faster in the
 following cases:
 .
  - You have one expensive method which sets many internal variables,
    thus lazy evaluation of these dependent variables is preferred.
  - The expensive operation depends on one or more parameters
  - Changes to one or more parameters affect all dependent variables
  - You may want to hide the call to the 'compute' operation
