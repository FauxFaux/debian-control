Description: Ruby library to work with probability distributions
 This Ruby library allows one to generate random variable with a given
 probability distribution, or evaluate classical probability distributions.
 .
 The probability distributions currently implemented include: Normal univariate
 and bivariate, T, F, Chi Square, Binomial, Hypergeometric, Exponential,
 Poisson, Beta, LogNormal and Gamma.
 .
 If available, the library will use Ruby/GSL (from ruby-gsl package) for better
 performance.
