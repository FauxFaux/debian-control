Description: Ruby EventMachine driver for MongoDB
 An EventMachine client for MongoDB. Originally based on RMongo, this client
 aims to be as API compatible with ruby-mongo driver as possible.
 For methods that do not retrieve data from the database the API of em-mongo
 should be identical (though a subset) to the ruby-mongo driver.
