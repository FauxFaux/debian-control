Description: eventmachine-based implementation of the Redis protocol
 Modeled after eventmachine's implementation of the memcached protocol,
 and influenced by Ezra Zygmuntowicz's redis-rb library (distributed as
 part of Redis).
 .
 This library is only useful when used as part of an application that
 relies on Event Machine's event loop.  It implements an EM-based client
 protocol, which leverages the non-blocking nature of the EM interface
 to achieve significant parallelization without threads.
