Description: easily generate fake data
 This gem provides a port of Data::Faker from Perl, which can be used to easily
 generate fake data: names, addresses, phone numbers, etc. It comes in very
 handy for taking screenshots, having real-looking test data, and having your
 database populated with more than one or two records while you're doing
 development.
