Description: FFI based Ruby bindings for ZeroMQ (ØMQ) networking library
 ØMQ is a library which extends the standard socket interfaces with features
 traditionally provided by specialised messaging middleware products.
 .
 ØMQ sockets provide an abstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple
 messaging patterns, message filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to
 multiple transport protocols and more.
 .
 This module wraps ØMQ using Ruby FFI (foreign function interface). It is a
 pure Ruby wrapper so it can be used with any Ruby runtime that supports FFI,
 including MRI, Rubinius and JRuby.
