Description: Fix output fastq files from trinityrnaseq
 trinityrnaseq outputs fastq files that have been 'corrected'
 .
 Unfortunately these files are no longer properly paired and therefore can't be
 used in most aligners such as bowtie2 and snap-aligner. This script attempts
 to fix that and produce 2 properly paired fastq files and a fastq file
 containing single reads
