Description: Process manager for applications with multiple components
 Foreman is a process manager commonly used during development of
 multi-component applications. For production, it allows allow you to either
 run your application directly or export it to some other process management
 format (i.e. init system service files).
 .
 Foreman uses a file called Procfile, which is the same mechanism for declaring
 what commands are run by your applicationâ€™s dynos on the Heroku platform. It
 follows the process model. You can use a Procfile to declare various process
 types, such as multiple types of workers, a singleton process like a clock, or
 a consumer of the Twitter streaming API.
