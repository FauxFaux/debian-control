Description: Build command-suite CLI apps without a lot of syntax
 Build command-suite CLI apps that are awesome.  Bootstrap your app, add
 commands, options and documentation while maintaining a well-tested idiomatic
 command-line app
 .
 GLI allows you to make a polished, easy-to-maintain command-line application
 without a lot of syntax, but without restricting you in any way from the power
 of OptionParser.
 .
 GLI is the best way to make a “command-suite” command-line application,
 e.g. one like git.
