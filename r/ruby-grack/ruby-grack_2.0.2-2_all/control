Description: Git Smart HTTP Server Rack implementation in Ruby/Rack
 Rack application replacement for the builtin git-http-backend CGI
 handler distributed with Git.
 .
 The default git-http-backend only runs as a CGI script, and
 specifically is only targeted for Apache 2.x usage (it requires
 PATH_INFO to be set and specifically formatted).  This Rack
 application can run on nearly every major and minor webserver out
 there by making it Rack capable.
 .
 This the GITLAB version of the library.
