Description: Simple Ruby framework for building REST-like APIs
 Grape is a REST-like API micro-framework for Ruby. It's designed to run on
 Rack or complement existing web application frameworks such as Rails and
 Sinatra by providing a simple DSL to easily develop RESTful APIs. It has
 built-in support for common conventions, including multiple formats,
 subdomain/prefix restriction, content negotiation, versioning and much more.
