Description: Haml Generator for Rails 3
 Haml-rails provides Haml generators for Rails 3. It also enables Haml as the
 templating engine for you, so you don't have to screw around in your own
 application.rb when your Gemfile already clearly indicated what templating
 engine you have installed. Hurrah.
