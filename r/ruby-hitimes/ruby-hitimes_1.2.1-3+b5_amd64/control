Description: fast, high resolution timer for recording performance metrics
 Hitimes is a fast, high resolution timer library for recording performance
 metrics. It uses the appropriate low method calls for each system to get
 the highest granularity time increments possible.
 .
 It currently supports any of the following systems: * any system with the
 POSIX call `clock_gettime()` * Mac OS X * Windows * JRuby Using Hitimes can
 be faster than using a series of `Time.new` calls, and it will have a much
 higher granularity. It is definitely faster than using `Process.times`.
