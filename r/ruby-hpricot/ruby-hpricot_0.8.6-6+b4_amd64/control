Description: fast, enjoyable HTML parser
 Hpricot is a fast, flexible HTML parser written in C.  It's designed to be
 very accomodating (like Tanaka Akira's HTree) and to have a very helpful
 library (like some JavaScript libs -- JQuery, Prototype -- give you).
 .
 Also, Hpricot can be handy for reading broken XML files, since many of the
 same principles are used.  If a quote is missing, Hpricot tries to figure it
 out.  If tags overlap, Hpricot works on sorting them out.
