Description: Numerical integration for Ruby, with a simple interface
 This library offers numerical integration for Ruby, with a simple
 interface. The rectangular, trapezoidal, Simpson, adaptive
 quadrature, Monte Carlo and Romberg integration methods are available
 in pure Ruby. Better performance and support for infinite bounds can be
 obtained via Ruby/GSL (from the ruby-gsl package).
