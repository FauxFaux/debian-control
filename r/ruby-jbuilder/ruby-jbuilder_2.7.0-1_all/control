Description: creation of JSON structures via a Builder-style DSL
 Jbuilder gives you a simple domain-specific language in Ruby for declaring
 JSON structures that beats massaging giant hash structures. It is particularly
 helpful when the generation process is fraught with conditionals and loops.
 .
 Jbuilder can be used stand-alone or as an ActionView template language for
 Rails.
