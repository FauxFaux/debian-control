Description: CoffeeScript converter for Jekyll
 Jekyll::Coffeescript is a coffeeScript converter for Jekyll.
 In your Jekyll site, create CoffeeScript files that start with the
 following lines:
 ```text
 ---
 ---
 ```
 You need those three dashes in order for Jekyll to recognize it as
 "convertible". They won't be included in the content passed to the
 CoffeeScript compiler.
