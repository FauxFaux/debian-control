Description: Straightforward implementation of DBM - Ruby bindings
 Kyoto Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The
 database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of
 a key and a value. Every key and value is serial bytes with variable
 length. Both binary data and character string can be used as a key and
 a value. Each key must be unique within a database. There is neither
 concept of data tables nor data types. Records are organized in
 hash table or B+ tree.
 .
 Warning: while this library is thread-safe with Ruby 1.9.x,
 it is NOT thread-safe with Ruby 1.8.x.
 .
 This package contains the bindings for the Ruby scripting language.
