Description: Ruby FFI bindings to libmagic
 This package provides a Ruby FFI wrapper to the "magic" library that
 determines content type and encoding of files and strings. The library does
 three types of tests: file system tests, magic number tests, and language
 tests. The first test that succeeds causes the file type to be returned.
