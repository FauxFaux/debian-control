Description: Ruby library that provides access to a Maven installation
 This ruby library wraps a Maven installation and allows access to it by
 exposing it under a namespace provided by the gem.
 .
 Its main use is in combination with polyglot-maven and ruby-maven
 since it can be used in that way to write and use POM files with a
 convenient and familiar (for rubyists) domain specific language instead
 of traditional XML definitions as is expected by Maven.
