Description: Provides POSIX tarchive management for Ruby - transitional package
 Archive::Tar::Minitar is a pure-Ruby library and command-line utility that
 provides the ability to deal with POSIX tar(1) archive files.
 .
 The implementation is based heavily on Mauricio Ferna'ndez's implementation in
 rpa-base, but has been reorganised to promote reuse in other projects.
 .
 This is a transitional package for the old upstream name, also providing a
 gemspec, so the old gem name can still be used.
