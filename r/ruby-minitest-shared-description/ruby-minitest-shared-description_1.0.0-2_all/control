Description: Support for shared specs and shared spec subclasses for Minitest
 minitest-shared_description adds support for shared specs and shared spec
 subclasses to Minitest.  Minitest supports shared specs by default using plain
 ruby modules, but does not support shared spec subclasses.  In addition to
 making it possible to share subclasses, minitest-shared_desciption also
 provides a slightly nicer interface for sharing specs.
