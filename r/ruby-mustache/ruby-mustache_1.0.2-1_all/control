Description: Mustache is a framework-agnostic way to render logic-free views
 Inspired by ctemplate, Mustache is a framework-agnostic way to render
 logic-free views. (As in model-view-controller.)
 .
 As ctemplates says, "It emphasizes separating logic from presentation:
 it is impossible to embed application logic in this template
 language."
 .
 Think of Mustache as a replacement for your views. Instead of views
 consisting of ERB or HAML with random helpers and arbitrary logic,
 your views are broken into two parts: a Ruby class and an HTML
 template.
