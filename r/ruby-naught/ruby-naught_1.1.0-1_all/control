Description: Naught is a toolkit for building Null Objects
 Null Objects can make your code more confident (Confident Ruby is a book
 by Avdi Grimm on Patterns for Joyful Coding).
 .
 While you don't *need* a Null Object library, this one offers some
 conveniences you probably won't find elsewhere.
 .
 Learn more about this library from /usr/share/ruby-naught/README.markdown
 (It has many examples).
