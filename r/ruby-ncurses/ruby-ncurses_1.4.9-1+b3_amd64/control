Description: ruby extension for the ncurses C library
 All C functions are wrapped by module functions of the module "Ncurses",
 with exactly the same name. Additionally, C functions expecting a WINDOW* as
 their first argument can also be called as methods of the "Ncurses::WINDOW"
 class.
 .
 The panel library (for support of overlapping windows) is also wrapped, in
 the module "Ncurses::Panel".
 .
 This module is built with wide character support.
