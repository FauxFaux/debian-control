Description: Manages persistent connections using Net::HTTP
 This package provides persistent connections to Net::HTTP.
 .
 Creating a new HTTP connection for every request involves an extra TCP
 round-trip and causes TCP congestion avoidance negotiation to start over.
 Using persistent HTTP connections can dramatically increase the speed of HTTP.
 .
 Net::HTTP supports persistent connections with some API methods but does not
 handle reconnection gracefully.  Net::HTTP::Persistent supports reconnection
 and retry according to RFC 2616.
