Description: Ruby library for tunneling connections to servers with ssh
 Net::SSH::Gateway is a library for programmatically tunneling connections to
 servers via a single "gateway" host.
 It is useful for establishing Net::SSH connections to servers behind firewalls,
 but can also be used to forward ports and establish connections of other types,
 like HTTP, to servers with restricted access.
