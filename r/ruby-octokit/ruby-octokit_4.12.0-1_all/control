Description: Ruby toolkit for working with the GitHub API
 ruby-octokit wraps the GitHub API in a flat API client that follows Ruby
 conventions and requires little knowledge of REST.
 .
 It provides all expected features needed to interact with Github or
 any other implementation of their API:
 .
  - Authenticated (basic and oauth) and unauthenticated requests.
  - Access to all resources and fields.
  - Direct access to HTTP response headers if needed.
  - Pagination.
  - Hypermedia features (ruby-octokit is built on top of ruby-sawyer).
