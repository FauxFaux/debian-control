Description: Omniauth extrategy for Remote-User HTTP header
 This package allows applications using ruby-omniauth to authenticate users
 using the Remote-User HTTP header. This can be used with HTTP basic
 authentication, SSL client certificate authentication, and all authentication
 methods that sets the Remote-User header for the underlying application.
 .
 This should not be used in an application that is directly acessible from the
 network, but applications that are under a web server setup that will properly
 handle authentication before setting the Remote-User header for the
 application.
