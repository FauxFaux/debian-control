Description: OpenID Connect Server & Client Library
 OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
 protocol. It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on
 the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain
 basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like
 manner.
 .
 OpenID Connect allows clients of all types, including Web-based, mobile, and
 JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated
 sessions and end-users. The specification suite is extensible, allowing
 participants to use optional features such as encryption of identity data,
 discovery of OpenID Providers, and session management, when it makes sense
 for them.
