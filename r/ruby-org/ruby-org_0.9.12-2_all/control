Description: Emacs org-mode parser for Ruby
 An Emacs org-mode parser written in Ruby. The most significant thing this
 library does today is convert org-mode files to HTML or Textile. Currently,
 you cannot do much to customize the conversion. The supplied textile
 conversion is optimized for extracting "content" from the orgfile as opposed
 to "metadata."
