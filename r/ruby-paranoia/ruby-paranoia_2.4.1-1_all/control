Description: re-implementation of acts_as_paranoid for Rails 3
 Paranoia is a re-implementation of acts_as_paranoid for Rails 3, using much,
 much, much less code. You would use either plugin / gem if you wished that
 when you called destroy on an Active Record object that it didn't actually
 destroy it, but just "hid" the record. Paranoia does this by setting a
 deleted_at field to the current time when you destroy a record, and hides it
 by scoping all queries on your model to only include records which do not have
 a deleted_at field.
