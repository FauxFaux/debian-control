Description: alternate implementation of the Pathname class
 pathname2 is a library that provides an implementation of the Pathname
 class different from the one that ships as part of the Ruby standard
 library. It is a subclass of String, though several methods have been
 overridden to better fit a path context. In addition, it supports file
 URL's as paths, provides additional methods for Windows paths, and
 handles UNC paths on Windows properly.
