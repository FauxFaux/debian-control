Description: Faster pure Ruby implementation of Pathname with extra bits
 Pathutil tries to be a faster pure Ruby impelementation of Pathname.
 It arose out of a need to fix basic problems with Pathname, such as
 suscepetibility to join overrides, need for automatic encoding, and
 normalization (for stuff like Jekyll) and the ability to do other
 safe-style operations in an encapsulated format, like copying files and
 folders with symlinks but only if they originate from the given root.
