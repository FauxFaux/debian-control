Description: Ruby library for accessing the content of PDF files
 The PDF::Reader library implements a PDF parser conforming as much as possible
 to the PDF specification from Adobe. It provides programmatic access to the
 contents of a PDF file with a high degree of flexibility.
 .
 This is primarily a low-level library that should be used as the foundation
 for higher level functionality. There are a few exceptions to support very
 common use cases like extracting text from a page.
