Description: Syntax checks for Puppet manifests, templates, and Hiera YAML
 Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your
 system using a cross-platform specification language that manages all
 the separate elements normally aggregated in different files, like
 users, cron jobs, and hosts, along with obviously discrete elements
 like packages, services, and files.
 .
 This ruby module provides syntax checks for Puppet manifests,
 templates and Hiera YAML.
