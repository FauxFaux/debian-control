Description: Very dumb PEG parser library
 A very dumb PEG parser library, with a horrible interface. Son to aabro,
 grandson to neg, grand-grandson to parslet. There is also a javascript version
 jaabro.
 .
 You may use raabro by providing the parsing rules, then some rewrite rules.
 The parsing rules make use of the raabro basic parsers. The rewrite rules
 match names passed as first argument to the basic parsers to rewrite the
 resulting parse trees.
