Description: serve pjax responses through rack middleware
 Rack-pjax is middleware that lets you serve 'chrome-less' pages in response
 to pjax-requests.
 .
 It does this by stripping the generated body; only the title and inner-html
 of the pjax-container are sent to the client.
 .
 While this won't save you any time rendering the page, it gives you more
 flexibility where and how to define the pjax-container.
