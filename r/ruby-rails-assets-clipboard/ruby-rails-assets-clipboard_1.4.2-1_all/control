Description: provide clipboard javascript library via rails asset pipeline
 A modern approach to copy text to clipboard. No Flash. Just 2kb.
 .
 Copying text to the clipboard shouldn't be hard. It shouldn't require dozens
 of steps to configure or hundreds of KBs to load. But most of all, it
 shouldn't depend on Flash or any bloated framework.
 .
 That's why clipboard.js exists.
 .
 This package is built using rubygem autogenerated by rails-assets.org
