Description: detects text changes for input and textarea elements
 Simple cross browser detection of text changes for input and textarea
 elements using a jQuery custom event plugin by ZURB
 .
 Implementing this requires binding events to the keyup event, and a couple
 other events if you want to detect text changes on cut and paste. Even if
 you're a JavaScript god it's tedious to keeping writing this logic over and
 over again. Be smart and use the ZURB text change event plugin instead.
