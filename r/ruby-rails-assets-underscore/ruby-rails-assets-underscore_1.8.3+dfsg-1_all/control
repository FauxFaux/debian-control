Description: underscore.js for rails applications
 Underscore.js is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides support
 for the usual functional suspects (each, map, reduce, filter...) without
 extending any core JavaScript objects.
 .
 Rails Assets is the frictionless proxy between Bundler and Bower.
 .
 It automatically converts the packaged components into gems that are easily
 droppable into your asset pipeline and stay up to date.
