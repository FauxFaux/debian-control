Description: Real-time stats for preforking Rack servers
 Raindrops is a real-time stats toolkit to show statistics for Rack HTTP
 servers.  It is designed for preforking servers such as unicorn, but
 should support any Rack HTTP server on platforms supporting POSIX shared
 memory.  It may also be used as a generic scoreboard for sharing atomic
 counters across multiple processes.
Ruby-Versions: ruby2.5
