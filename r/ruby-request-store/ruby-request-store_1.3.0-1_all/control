Description: per-request global variable storage for Rack-based web servers
 RequestStore gives you per-request global storage of variables for Rack-
 compliant web servers. It is intended as an alternative to Thread.current, to
 avoid bugs in threaded server implementations. RequestStore supports Rails 3+
 out-of-the-box, but can be configured for use in Rails 2.x and non-Rails
 environments.
