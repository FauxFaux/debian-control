Description: partial wrapper around the SIOCETHTOOL ioctl
 Have you ever needed to get at some details about a network interface from
 inside a Ruby script, but got stuck trying to parse the output of ethtool? If
 so, you're one-in-a-million, but at least you don't have to write an ethtool
 parser any more. use Rethtool instead!
 .
 At present, Rethtool only supports a couple of things:
  * Retrieve various details about the interface (link speed, duplex, etc).
  * Determine if the link is currently up or down.
 .
 Adding extra SIOCETHTOOL features is relatively straightforward, thanks to
 cstruct and the base infrastructure already in place.
