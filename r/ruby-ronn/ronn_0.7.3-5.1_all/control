Description: Builds manuals from Markdown
 Ronn builds manuals. It converts simple, human readable textfiles to roff for
 terminal display, and also to HTML for the web.
 .
 The source format includes all of Markdown but has a more rigid structure and
 syntax extensions for features commonly found in manpages (definition lists,
 link notation, etc.). The ronn-format(7) manual page defines the format in
 detail.
 .
 This package contains the ronn conversion tool.
