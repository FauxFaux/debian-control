Description: HTTP/REST API client Ruby library
 Sawyer is an experimental hypermedia HTTP client built on top of ruby-faraday.
 .
 Although Sawyer provides the expected features of an HTTP client library,
 it's more useful when is used to interact and to implement REST APIs
 endpoints.
 .
 Out of the box it can parse data from API responses, turns contents into
 high level resources or collections of resources, relations between those
 resources, etc.
