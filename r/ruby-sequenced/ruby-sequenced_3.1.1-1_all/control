Description: generate scoped sequential IDs for ActiveRecord models
 This library provides an `acts_as_sequenced` macro that automatically assigns
 a unique, sequential ID to each record. The sequential ID is not a replacement
 for the database primary key, but rather adds another way to
 retrieve the object without exposing the primary key.
