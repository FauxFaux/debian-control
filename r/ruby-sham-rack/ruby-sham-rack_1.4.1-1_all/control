Description: Net::HTTP-to-Rack plumbing for HTTP testing
 ShamRack plumbs Net::HTTP directly into Rack, for quick and easy HTTP testing.
 .
 Well, it makes it easy to _stub out external (HTTP) services_, which is handy
 in development and testing environments, or when you want to _test your HTTP
 client code_.
 .
 You can also use it to _test your Rack application_ (or Sinatra, or Rails, or
 Merb) using a variety of HTTP client libraries, to check interoperability.
