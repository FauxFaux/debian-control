Description: System Information Gatherer And Reporter
 One API to access system information regardless of the underlying platform
 .
 Hyperic's System Information Gatherer (SIGAR) is a cross-platform API for
 collecting software inventory data. SIGAR is core of HQ's auto-discovery
 functionality, and you can use it to extend auto-discovery behavior.
 .
 SIGAR includes support for Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX and
 Mac OSX across a variety of versions and architectures. Users of the SIGAR
 API are given portable access to inventory and monitoring data including:
 .
  * System memory, swap, cpu, load average, uptime, logins
  * Per-process memory, cpu, credential info, state, arguments, environment,
    open files
  * File system detection and metrics
  * Network interface detection, configuration information and metrics
  * Network route and connection tables
 .
 This is ruby binding for the core API, which is implemented in pure C.
