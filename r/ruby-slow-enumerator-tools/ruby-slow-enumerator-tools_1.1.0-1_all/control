Description: transformation of Ruby enumerators to produce data slowly and unpredictably
 This Ruby library provides tools for transforming Ruby enumerators that
 produce data slowly and unpredictably.
 .
   * SlowEnumeratorTools.merge: given a collection of enumerables, creates a
     new enumerator that yields elements from any of these enumerables as soon
     as they become available.
 .
   * SlowEnumeratorTools.batch: given an enumerable, creates a new enumerable
     that yields batches containing all elements currently available.
 .
   * SlowEnumeratorTools.buffer: given an enumerable and a number, will create
     a buffer of that number of elements and try to fill it up with as many
     elements from that enumerable, so that they can be yielded immediately.
