Description: Snorlax is a flexible controller for Rails APIs
 Snorlax is an opinionated, flexible, and well-RESTed gem for building Rails
 APIs. It's designed to Do The Right Thingâ„¢ by default, but allow you to
 customize where necessary. Snorlax is designed to provide a set of flexible
 API endpoints for client side consumption. It uses side loading, which means
 that all of the records returned are unnested and easily available for
 consumption.
