Description: Ruby version constraint solver implementing semantic versioning
 Ruby versioning constraint solver implementing Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
 (see http://semver.org/).
 .
 Solve supports two different resolvers. A pure Ruby solver implemented using
 Molinillo and the same dependency resolver the Chef Server uses, dep-selector,
 which is a Ruby C extension for Gecode.
 .
 The Ruby solver is installed and enabled by default. If you'd like to use the
 Gecode solver you can do so by installing the ruby-dep-selector package.
