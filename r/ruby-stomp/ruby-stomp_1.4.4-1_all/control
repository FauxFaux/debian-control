Description: Ruby client for the stomp messaging protocol
 Stomp is a text-oriented wire protocol for messaging (MOM/MQ/JMS)
 type systems. This library provides two useful interfaces, a low-
 level class, Stomp::Connection, which is a basic protocol
 implementation, and Stomp::Client, which is designed as a higher
 level convenience API.
