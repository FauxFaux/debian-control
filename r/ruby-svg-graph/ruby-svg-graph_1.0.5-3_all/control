Description: Pure Ruby library for generating charts in SVG format
 SVG::Graph allows one to generate charts, that is, graphs where the values of
 one axis are not scalar. It has a very similar API to the Perl library
 SVG::TT::Graph, and the resulting charts also look the same. This isn't
 surprising, because SVG::Graph started as a loose port of SVG::TT::Graph,
 although the internal code no longer resembles the Perl original at all.
