Description: improved Logger replacement that logs to syslog
 Logger::Syslog is a Logger replacement that logs to syslog. It is almost
 drop-in with a few caveats. Add Logger::Syslog to your Rails production
 environment to aggregate logs between multiple machines.
 .
 This particular Logger::Syslog improves the original by correctly
 mapping Rails log severities to the Syslog counterparts. It also adds
 the ability to select a syslog facility other than "user".
