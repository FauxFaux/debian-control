Description: Ruby library that colors strings using ANSI escape sequences
 Small Ruby library that colors strings using ANSI escape sequences.
 It's possible to use constants or unary functions. Block-forms
 also autoreset at the block's end. It's also possible to use this
 module as a mixin for classes of objects that respond to :to_str,
 e.g. String.
 .
 This package is part of the Ruby library extras, a supplement to Ruby's
 standard library.
