Description: Ruby library that creates temporary files and directories for testing
 TestConstruct is a DSL for creating temporary files and directories during
 testing.
 .
 Using construct is as simple as calling within_construct and providing a
 block. All files and directories that are created within that block are
 created within a temporary directory. The temporary directory is always
 deleted before within_construct finishes.
 .
 There is nothing special about the files and directories created with
 TestConstruct, so you can use plain old Ruby IO methods to interact with them.
