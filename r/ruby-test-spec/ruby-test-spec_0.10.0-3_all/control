Description: Ruby library providing behaviour driven development interface for Test::Unit
 The test/spec library layers an RSpec-inspired interface on top of Test::Unit,
 so you can mix test-driven and behavior-driven development.
 .
 test/spec is a clean-room implementation that maps most kinds of Test::Unit
 assertions to a `should'-like syntax.
