Description: thread-safe collections and utilities for Ruby
 This Ruby library contains a collection of data structures providing
 thread-safe versions of arrays and hashes. These data structures lock
 against the objects themselves for every method call, ensuring only one thread
 can be reading or writing at a time.
 .
 These data structures as well as the utilities contained in this library make
 thread-safe programming in Ruby easier.
