Description: Fast date/time parser gem for Ruby
 Date/time parser for Ruby with the following features:
 .
  * Extensible with custom formats and tokens.
  * It's pretty fast. Up to 60% faster than Time/Date parse method.
  * Control the parser strictness.
  * Control behaviour of ambiguous date formats (US vs European e.g. mm/dd/yy,
    dd/mm/yy).
  * I18n support (for months), if I18n gem loaded.
  * Fewer WTFs than Time/Date parse method.
 .
 Extracted from the validates_timeliness gem, it has been rewritten cleaner and
 much faster. It's most suitable for when you need to control the parsing
 behaviour. It's faster than the Time/Date class parse methods, so it has
 eneral appeal.
