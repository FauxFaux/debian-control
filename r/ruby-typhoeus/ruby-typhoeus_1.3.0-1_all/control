Description: parallel HTTP library on top of ethon
 Typhoeus is a HTTP client library based on Ethon which wraps libcurl.
 Sitting on top of libcurl makes Typhoeus very reliable and fast.
 .
 Like a modern code version of the mythical beast with 100 serpent heads,
 Typhoeus runs HTTP requests in parallel while cleanly encapsulating handling
 logic.
