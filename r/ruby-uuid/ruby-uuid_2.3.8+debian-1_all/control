Description: UUID generator for Ruby
 UUID generator for producing universally unique identifiers based on RFC 4122.
 These identifiers are useful in distributed applications like diaspora.
 .
 A UUID is 128 bit long, and consists of a 60-bit time value, a 16-bit
 sequence number and a 48-bit node identifier.
 .
 To guarantee that UUIDs are unique across all machines in the network,
 the IEEE 802 MAC address of the machine's network interface card is used as
 the node identifier.
 .
