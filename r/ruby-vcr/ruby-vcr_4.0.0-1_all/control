Description: Record and replay HTTP interactions (Ruby library)
 Record your test suite's HTTP interactions and replay them during future test
 runs for fast, deterministic, accurate tests.
 .
  * Automatically records and replays your HTTP interactions with minimal
    setup/configuration code.
  * Supports and works with the HTTP stubbing facilities of multiple libraries.
    Currently, the following are supported:
    * WebMock
    * Typhoeus
    * Faraday
    * Excon
  * Supports multiple HTTP libraries:
    * Patron (when using WebMock)
    * Curb (when using WebMock -- only supports Curl::Easy at the moment)
    * HTTPClient (when using WebMock)
    * em-http-request (when using WebMock)
    * Net::HTTP (when using WebMock)
    * Typhoeus (Typhoeus::Hydra, but not Typhoeus::Easy or Typhoeus::Multi)
    * Excon
    * Faraday
    * And of course any library built on Net::HTTP, such as Mechanize, HTTParty
      or Rest Client
  * Request matching is configurable based on HTTP method, URI, host, path, body
    and headers, or you can easily implement a custom request matcher to handle
    any need.
  * The same request can receive different responses in different tests--just
    use different cassettes.
  * The recorded requests and responses are stored on disk in a serialization
    format of your choice (currently YAML and JSON are built in, and you can
    easily implement your own custom serializer) and can easily be inspected and
    edited.
  * Dynamic responses are supported using ERB.
  * Optionally re-records cassettes on a configurable regular interval to keep
    them fresh and current.
  * Disables all HTTP requests that you don't explicitly allow.
  * Simple Cucumber integration is provided using tags.
  * Includes convenient RSpec macros and integration with RSpec 2 metadata.
  * Known to work well with many popular Ruby libraries including RSpec 1 & 2,
    Cucumber, Test::Unit, Capybara, Mechanize, Rest Client and HTTParty.
  * Includes Rack and Faraday middleware.
