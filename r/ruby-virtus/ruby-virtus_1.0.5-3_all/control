Description: attributes on steroids for plain old Ruby objects
 The goal of this Ruby library is to provide a common API for defining
 attributes on a model so all object relational and object document mappers
 could use it instead of reinventing the wheel all over again.
 .
 It is also suitable for any other use case where Ruby objects need to be
 extended with attributes that require data coercions.
 .
 This is a partial extraction of the DataMapper property API.
