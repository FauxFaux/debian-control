Description: WebSocket protocol handler with pluggable I/O
 This module provides a complete implementation of the WebSocket
 protocols that can be hooked up to any TCP library. It aims to simplify
 things by decoupling the protocol details from the I/O layer, such that
 users only need to implement code to stream data in and out of it
 without needing to know anything about how the protocol actually works.
 .
 Think of it as a complete WebSocket system with pluggable I/O.
