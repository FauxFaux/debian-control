Description: Generic extension manager for WebSocket connections
 A minimal framework that supports the implementation of WebSocket extensions
 in a way that's decoupled from the main protocol. This library aims to allow a
 WebSocket extension to be written and used with any protocol library, by
 defining abstract representations of frames and messages that allow modules to
 co-operate.
