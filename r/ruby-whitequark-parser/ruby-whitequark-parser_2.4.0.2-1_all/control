Description: Ruby parser written in pure Ruby
 parser is a production-ready Ruby parser written in pure Ruby. It
 recognizes as much or more code than Ripper, Melbourne, JRubyParser
 or ruby_parser, and is vastly more convenient to use.
 .
 Among its keys features are: it provides precise source location
 reporting, it has a documented AST format which is convenient to work
 with, it parses 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 syntax with
 backwards-compatible AST formats and also parses MacRuby and
 RubyMotion syntax extensions. It also has improved clang-like
 diagnostic messages with location information.
 .
 Since it's written in pure Ruby, runs on MRI 1.8.7 or >=1.9.2, JRuby
 and Rubinius, it has excellent test coverage and the source code is
 readable and well commented.
 .
 Not to be confused with ruby_parser gem from Ryan Davis, of seattle.rb
 Ruby user group.
