Description: Pagination for Rails
 The will_paginate library provides a simple, yet powerful and
 extensible API for pagination and rendering of pagination links in
 ActionView templates.
 .
 Pagination is just limiting the number of records displayed, showing
 a subset of them at any given view, and allowing you to move the
 displayed window. This plugin makes the whole process a breeze.
 .
 Although this package is aimed at being used from the Ruby on Rails
 framework, any Enumerable class can include WillPaginate, giving it
 this functionality.
