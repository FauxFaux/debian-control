Description: library to export/import of database into/from yaml files
 YamlDb is a database-independent format for dumping and restoring
 data from any database that has an ActiveRecord adapter.
 .
 This can be used as a replacement for mysqldump or pg_dump, but only
 for the databases typically used by Rails apps.  Users, permissions,
 schemas, triggers, and other advanced database features are not
 supported - by design.
