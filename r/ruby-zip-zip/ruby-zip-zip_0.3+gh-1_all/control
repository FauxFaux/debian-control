Description: ease the migration to RubyZip v1.0.0
 So you've upgraded a gem dependency that requires RubyZip v1.0.0 or higher.
 While all your other dependencies use the interface provided by v0.x.
 .
 zip-zip provides a simple adapter to let all your dependencies use RubyZip
 v1.0.0. It is very simple and light weight, aliasing the old class names
 to the new.
