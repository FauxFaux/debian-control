Description: C++ parser library for CGI applications - development libraries
 RudeCGI is a  C++ parser library for accessing form data, path info and cookie
 data from CGI applications. In addition to normal GET and POST data, the
 component supports file uploads (multipart/form-data), and simple XML content
 types (text/XML) - allowing easy use with XML based clients such as Flash
 applications. Furthermore, the component supports path-mapping, allowing
 information to be specified without identifying keywords. In addition to
 normal CGI operation, if the component detects that it is not in a web-
 environment it provides an interactive console dialog to let you supply
 formdata in real-time as the application requests it. The component does
 not parse the environment until the application first accesses the instance
 object. As such, no parsing overhead will occur if the application does not
 explicitly access the component.
