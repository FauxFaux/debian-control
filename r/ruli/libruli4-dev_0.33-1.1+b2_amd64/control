Description: Library for easily querying DNS SRV records - development files
 RULI stands for Resolver User Layer Interface. It's a library
 built on top of an asynchronous DNS stub resolver. RULI
 provides an easy-to-use interface for querying DNS SRV
 resource records. The goal is to promote the wide deployment
 of SRV-cognizant client programs. RULI aims to fully support
 SRV-related standards.
 .

 header files, required to develop and/or compile
 applications that use RULI.
