Description: minimal console getty that can run any process
 rungetty might be the getty you were looking for.  It is able to run any
 program, not just login. If a different program than login is used it usually
 is run as nobody:nogroup, or the user/group specified on the commandline.
 rungetty can even be configured to autologin, under certain circumstances.
 See the manual page for more information.

 You have to change some lines in /etc/inittab for having any effect after
 installing the package.  rungetty is based on mingetty and therefore not
 suitable for serial use.
