Description: Simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find
 While it does not seek to mirror all of find's powerful functionality,
 fd provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.
 .
 Features:
 .
  * Convenient syntax: ‘fd PATTERN’ instead of ‘find -iname '*PATTERN*'’.
  * Colorized terminal output (similar to ls).
  * It's fast, often faster than find.
  * Smart case.
  * Ignores hidden directories and files, by default.
  * Ignores patterns from your .gitignore, by default.
  * Regular expressions.
  * Unicode-awareness.
  * Parallel command execution with a syntax similar to GNU Parallel.
 .
  Please note: the executable and the associated manpage were renamed
  from ‘fd’ to ‘fdfind’ because of a file name clash.
