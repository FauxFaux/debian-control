Description: Secure multithreaded packet sniffer
 sniffglue is a network sniffer written in rust. Network packets are parsed
 concurrently using a thread pool to utilize all cpu cores. Project goals are
 that you can run sniffglue securely on untrusted networks and that it must not
 crash when processing packets. The output should be as useful as possible by
 default.
