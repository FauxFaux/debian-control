Description: Rust implementation of a TAR file reader and writer - feature "xattr"
 This library does not currently handle compression, but it is abstract over all
 I/O readers and writers. Additionally, great lengths are taken to ensure that
 the entire contents are never required to be entirely resident in memory all at
 once.
 .
 This metapackage enables feature xattr for the Rust tar crate, by pulling in
 any additional dependencies needed by that feature.
