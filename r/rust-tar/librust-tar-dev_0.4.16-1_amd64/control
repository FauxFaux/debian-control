Description: A TAR file reader and writer - Rust source code
 This library does not currently handle compression, but it is abstract over all
 I/O readers and writers. Additionally, great lengths are taken to ensure that
 the entire contents are never required to be entirely resident in memory all at
 once.
 .
 This package contains the source for the Rust tar crate, packaged by debcargo
 for use with cargo and dh-cargo.
