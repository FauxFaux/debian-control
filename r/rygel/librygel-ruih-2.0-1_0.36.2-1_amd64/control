Description: GNOME UPnP/DLNA services - ruih library
 Rygel is a home media solution that allows you to easily share audio, video
 and pictures, and control of media player on your home network. In technical
 terms it is both a UPnP AV MediaServer and MediaRenderer implemented through
 a plug-in mechanism. Interoperability with other devices in the market is
 achieved by conformance to very strict requirements of DLNA and on the fly
 conversion of media to format that client devices are capable of handling.
 .
 This package contains a library implementing the Remote User Interface Server
 protocol interfaces.
