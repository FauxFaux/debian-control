Description: Train SpamAssassin with spam/ham from user's imap mailbox(es)
 sa-learn-cyrus is a perl script using sa-learn from the SpamAssassin package
 to train it knowing spam and ham. sa-learn-cyrus gets its spam and ham
 messages from Cyrus-imapd mailboxes instead of mbox files or Maildirs as
 sa-learn does. This is useful for Cyrus users who for example sort their
 missed spam into a subfolder and let sa-learn-cyrus read it out (e.g. using a
 cron job).
 .
 SpamAssassin is spam filter with numerous features including automatic
 white-listing, RBL testing, Bayesian analysis, header and body text analysis.
 .
 Cyrus is a fully-featured IMAP daemon.
