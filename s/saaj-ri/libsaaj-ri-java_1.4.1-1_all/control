Description: SOAP with Attachments API for Java - Reference Implementation
 The SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ) provides the API for creating
 and sending SOAP messages by means of the javax.xml.soap package. It is used
 for the SOAP messaging that goes on behind the scenes in JAX-WS, JAX-RPC,
 and JAXR implementations. SOAP Handlers in JAX-WS use SAAJ APIs to access
 the SOAP Message. Developers can also use it to write SOAP messaging
 applications directly instead of using JAX-WS/JAX-RPC.
