Description: SOAP with Attachment API for Java
 The SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ) provides the API for
 creating and building SOAP messages. The SAAJ API conforms to the
 Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) 1.1 and 1.2 specifications, and
 the SOAP with Attachments specification.
 .
 The SAAJ API defines the javax.xml.soap package which was integrated
 to the JRE since Java 6 and was eventually removed in Java 11.
