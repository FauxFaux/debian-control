Description: Object-oriented fully featured parser generator
 SableCC is a parser generator which generates fully featured
 object-oriented frameworks for building compilers, interpreters and
 other text parsers.
 .
 In particular, generated frameworks include intuitive strictly-typed
 abstract syntax trees and tree walkers. SableCC also keeps a clean
 separation between machine-generated code and user-written code.
 .
 This package also contains AntTask, a task to invoke SableCC on grammar
 files.
