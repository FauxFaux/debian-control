Description: web-based binary newsreader with nzb support
 SABnzbd+ is a web-based binary newsgrabber written in Python, with support for
 the popular nzb file format. It greatly simplifies the process of downloading

 and advanced built-in post-processing options including the ability to
 automatically verify, repair, extract and clean up downloaded posts.

 Multiple servers are supported, as well as secure (ssl) connections, ipv6,
 scheduling, pausing and resuming downloads, queue manipulation, rss feeds,
 automatic sorting, a download history, email notifications, and custom
 post-processing scripts. An extensive API allows third party applications to
 interact with the program.

 This package contains the program itself and all interface templates.
