Description: wrapper around the rm command to prevent accidental deletions
 This package provides a tool intended to prevent the accidental deletion
 of important files by replacing rm with a wrapper, which checks the
 given arguments against a configurable blacklist of files and directories
 that should never be removed.
 .
 Users who attempt to delete one of these protected files or directories will
 not be able to do so and will be shown a warning message instead.
 .
 Protected paths can be set both at the site and user levels.
