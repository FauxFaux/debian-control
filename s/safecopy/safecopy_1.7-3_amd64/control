Description: data recovery tool for problematic or damaged media
 Safecopy tries to get as much data from SOURCE as possible, even resorting
 to device specific low level operations if applicable. This is achieved by
 identifying problematic or damaged areas, skipping over them and continuing
 reading afterwards. The corresponding area in the destination file is either
 skipped (on initial creation that means padded with zeros) or deliberately
 filled with a recognizable pattern to later find affected files on a corrupted
 device. The work is similar to ddrescue, generating an image of the original
 media. This media can be floppy disks, harddisk partitions, CDs, DVDs, tape
 devices, where other tools like dd would fail due to I/O errors.
 .
 Safecopy uses an incremental algorithm to identify the exact beginning and
 end of bad areas, allowing the user to trade minimum accesses to bad areas
 for thorough data resurrection.
 .
 Multiple passes over the same file are possible, to first retrieve as much
 data from a device as possible with minimum harm, and then trying to retrieve
 some of the remaining data with increasingly aggressive read attempts.
 .
 Safecopy includes a low level I/O layer to read CDROM disks in raw mode,
 and issue device resets and other helpful low level operations on a number
 of other device classes.
 .
 Safecopy is useful in forensics investigations and disaster recovery.
