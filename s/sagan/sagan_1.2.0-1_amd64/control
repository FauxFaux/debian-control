Description: Real-time System & Event Log Monitoring System
 Sagan is a multi-threaded, real time system- and event-log monitoring
 system, but with a twist. Sagan uses a “Snort” like rule set for
 detecting malicious events happening on your network and/or computer
 systems.
 If Sagan detects a potentially bad event, that event can be stored to a
 Snort database (MySQL/PostgreSQL), send it to a SIEM tool like Prelude,
 or send an email.
 Sagan is meant to be used in a ‘centralized’ logging environment, but
 will work fine as part of a standalone Host IDS system for workstations.
