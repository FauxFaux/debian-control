Description: Standalone Sage Notebook
 The Sage Notebook is a web-based graphical user interface for
 mathematical software.
 .
 Sage is a different approach to mathematics software. It makes it easy for you
 to use most mathematics software together. Sage includes GAP, GP/PARI, Maxima,
 and Singular, and dozens of other open source math packages. It aims to be a
 viable open source alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica, and MATLAB.
 .
 With the Sage Notebook anyone can create, collaborate on, and publish
 interactive worksheets. In a worksheet, one can write code using Sage, Python,
 and other software included in Sage. You can write programs that combine
 serious mathematics with anything else.
 .
 Most of the notebook does not depend on having Sage installed. Only
 a few miscellaneous functions are imported from Sage.
 .
 Unfortunately these few imports are still a circular dependency that upstream
 never got around to fixing, mean that one cannot "import sagenb" unless sage
 is also installed.
