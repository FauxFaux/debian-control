Description: Significance Analysis of INTeractome
 SAINT implements the scoring algorithm for protein-protein interaction
 data using label free quantitative proteomics data in AP-MS experiments.
 It was used for spectral count data in the yeast kinase interactome work
 not incorporating control purification, as well as a generalized
 implementation for spectral count data with and without control

 Alternatively, you can also run SAINT in combination with ProHits.
 .
 The package was written for either doing analysis without or with
 control IPs and
