Description: Library and stand-alone CLI tools to access a salt-api instance
 pepperlib abstracts the HTTP calls to salt-api so existing Python projects can
 easily integrate with a remote Salt installation just by instantiating a
 class.
 .
 The pepper CLI script allows users to execute Salt commands from computers
 that are external to computers running the salt-master or salt-minion daemons
 as though they were running Salt locally.
