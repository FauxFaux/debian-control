Description: Generic, modular network access system
 a modular interface on top of Salt that can provide a variety of entry points
 into a running Salt system. It can start and manage multiple interfaces
 allowing a REST API to coexist with XMLRPC or even a Websocket API.
 .
 The Salt API system is used to expose the fundamental aspects of Salt control
 to external sources. salt-api acts as the bridge between Salt itself and
 REST, Websockets, etc.
