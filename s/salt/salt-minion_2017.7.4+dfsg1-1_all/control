Description: client package for salt, the distributed remote execution system
 salt is a powerful remote execution manager that can be used to
 administer servers in a fast and efficient way.
 .
 It allows commands to be executed across large groups of
 servers. This means systems can be easily managed, but data can
 also be easily gathered.  Quick introspection into running
 systems becomes a reality.
 .
 Remote execution is usually used to set up a certain state on a
 remote system. Salt addresses this problem as well, the salt
 state system uses salt state files to define the state a server
 needs to be in.
 .
 Between the remote execution system, and state management Salt
 addresses the backbone of cloud and data center management.
 .
 This particular package provides the worker / agent for salt.
