Description: remote manager to administer servers via Salt SSH
 salt is a powerful remote execution manager that can be used to
 administer servers in a fast and efficient way.
 .
 It allows commands to be executed across large groups of
 servers. This means systems can be easily managed, but data can
 also be easily gathered.  Quick introspection into running
 systems becomes a reality.
 .
 Remote execution is usually used to set up a certain state on a
 remote system. Salt addresses this problem as well, the salt
 state system uses salt state files to define the state a server
 needs to be in.
 .
 Between the remote execution system, and state management Salt
 addresses the backbone of cloud and data center management.
 .
 This particular package provides the salt ssh controller. It
 is able to run salt modules and states on remote hosts via ssh.
 No minion or other salt specific software needs to be installed
 on the remote host.
