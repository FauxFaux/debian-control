Description: Windows domain authentication integration plugin
 Samba is an implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol for Unix systems,
 providing support for cross-platform file and printer sharing with
 Microsoft Windows, OS X, and other Unix systems.  Samba can also function
 as an NT4-style domain controller, and can integrate with both NT4 domains
 and Active Directory realms as a member server.
 .
 This package provides pam_winbind, a plugin that integrates with a local
 winbindd server to provide Windows domain authentication to the system.
