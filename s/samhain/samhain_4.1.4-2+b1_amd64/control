Description: Data integrity and host intrusion alert system
 Samhain is an integrity checker and host intrusion detection system that
 can be used on single hosts as well as large, UNIX-based networks.
 It supports central monitoring as well as powerful (and new) stealth
 features to run undetected on memory using steganography.
 .

     * Centralized monitoring
          + native support for logging to a central server via encrypted
