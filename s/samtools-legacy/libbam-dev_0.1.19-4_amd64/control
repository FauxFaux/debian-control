Description: manipulates nucleotide sequence alignments in BAM or SAM format
 The BAM library provides I/O and various operations on manipulating nucleotide
 sequence alignments in the BAM (Binary Alignment/Mapping) or SAM (Sequence
 Alignment/Map) format. It now supports importing from or exporting to SAM,
 sorting, merging, generating pileup, and quickly retrieval of reads overlapped
 with a specified region.
 .
 This library is part of SAMtools version 0.1.19.  It is obsolete and provided
 only to build software that has not yet transitioned to the HTSlib, which
 replaces this library.
