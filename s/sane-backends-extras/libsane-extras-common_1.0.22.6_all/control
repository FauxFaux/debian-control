Description: API library for scanners -- documentation and support files
 SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application
 programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any
 raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner,
 video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE standard is
 free and its discussion and development are open to everybody. The
 current source code is written to support several operating systems,
 including GNU/Linux, OS/2, Win32 and various Unices and is available
 under the GNU General Public License (commercial applications and
 backends are welcome, too, however).
 .
 This package includes documentation for libsane-extras, such as the man
 pages and other support files.
