Description: API library for scanners -- extra backends
 SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application
 programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any
 raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner,
 video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE standard is
 free and its discussion and development are open to everybody. The
 current source code is written to support several operating systems,
 including GNU/Linux, OS/2, Win32 and various Unices and is available
 under the GNU General Public License (commercial applications and
 backends are welcome, too, however).
 .
 This package includes some backends that are not yet included into the
 official SANE distribution. Currently, they are :
   * geniusvp2 (Genius ColorPage-Vivid Pro II)
   * ls5000 (Nikon LS-5000 ED, Coolscan 5000 ED)
