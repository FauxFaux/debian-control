Description: The Anomy Mail Sanitizer - an email virus scanner
 The Anomy sanitizer is what most people would call "an email virus scanner".
 That description is not totally accurate, but it does cover one of the more
 important jobs that the sanitizer can do for you - it can scan email
 attachments for viruses. Other things it can do:
 .
 Disable potentially dangerous HTML code, such as javascript, within
 incoming email.
 .
 Protect you from email-based break-in attempts which exploit bugs in
 common email programs (Outlook, Eudora, Pine, ...).
 .
 Block or "mangle" attachments based on their file names. This way if you
 don't *need* to receive e.g. visual basic scripts, then you don't have to
 worry about the security risk they imply (the ILOVEYOU virus was a
 visual basic program). This lets you protect yourself and your users
 from whole classes of attacks, without relying on complex, resource
 intensive and outdated virus scanning solutions.
