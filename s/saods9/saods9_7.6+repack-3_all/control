 buffers, region manipulation, and many scale algorithms and colormaps. It
 provides for easy communication with external analysis tasks and is highly
 configurable and extensible via XPA and SAMP.
 .
 All versions and platforms support a consistent set of GUI and
 functional capabilities.
 .
 DS9 supports advanced features such as 2-D, 3-D and RGB frame buffers, mosaic
 images, tiling, blinking, geometric markers, colormap manipulation, scaling,
 arbitrary zoom, cropping, rotation, pan, and a variety of coordinate
 systems.
