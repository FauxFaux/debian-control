Description: Tk widgets for astronomical imaging and data visualization
 SAOTk is an integrated set of Tcl/Tk canvas widgets for astronomical
 imaging and data visualization. The widget set is composed of the
 Frame, Panner, Magnifier, and Colorbar widgets. In addition to
 classical support for imaging FITS data, manipulating colormaps,
 region marking, coordinate readout (including WCS), etc, SAOTk
 widgets also support arbitrary image scaling and rotation, advanced
 postscript printing, Truecolor graphic support, and image mosaics.
 .
 The SAOTk widgets are being used in a wide variety of astronomical
 applications. These applications include general visualization and
 analysis, real-time instrumentation and calibration, and interactive
 modeling. These Tcl extensions can be utilized in any standard Tcl/Tk
 environment to build custom data analysis and visualization
 applications.
