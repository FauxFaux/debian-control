Description: A minimal but configurable X11R6 window manager
 Sapphire is a window manager for X11R6. It is fairly minimal in
 what it provides on screen: one toolbar, the usual window borders
 and a popup menu from the root window.
 .
 It supports themes as X resource files, and the menu is editable.
 If you install the 'menu' package, you'll get an automatically updated
 'Debian' submenu of installed programs.
