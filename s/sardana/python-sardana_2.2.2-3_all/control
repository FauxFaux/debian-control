Description: instrument control and data acquisition system - library
 Sardana is a Supervision, Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for
 scientific installations. It is written in Python and based on the TANGO
 library. The hardware control and data acquisition routines can be
 accessed via an IPython console and a generic graphical user interface
 (both of which are easily extensible by the user).
