Description: testsuite for Sass - data files
 Sass makes CSS fun again. Sass is an extension of CSS3, adding nested
 rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more.
 .
 sass-spec is a testsuite verified against the original ruby-sass, which
 should succeed for alternative implementations as well.
 .
 This package provides data files for sass-spec.
