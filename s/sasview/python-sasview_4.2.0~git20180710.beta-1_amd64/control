Description: Small Angle Scattering Analysis (Python 2)
 SasView is a Small Angle Scattering Analysis Software Package,
 originally developed as part of the NSF DANSE project under the name
 SansView, now managed by an international collaboration of facilities.
 .
 SasView is software for the analysis of Small-Angle Scattering (SAS)
 data.
 .
 It fits analytic functions describing different types of material
 microstructure to experimental data in order to determine the shape,
 size and degree of ordering.
 .
 SasView also includes tools for calculating scattering length
 densities, slit sizes, resolution, fringe thicknesses/d-spacings, the
 (Porod) invariant ('total scattering'), and distance distribution
 functions.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 2.
