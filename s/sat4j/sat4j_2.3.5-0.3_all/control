Description: Efficient library of SAT solvers in Java
 The aim of the SAT4J library is to provide an efficient library of SAT solvers
 in Java. Compared to the OpenSAT project, the SAT4J library targets first
 users of SAT "black boxes", willing to embed  SAT technologies into their
 application without worrying about the details. The SAT4J project also tries
 to provide a basis of work for SAT researchers.
