Description: Common Lisp compiler and development system
 SBCL is a development environment for the ANSI Common Lisp language.
 It provides a native-code compiler and an integrated debugger, as well
 as all the features in the ANSI specification.
 .
 SBCL also contains other extensions to the ANSI specification, including
 a foreign-function interface, a pseudo-server API, user-extensible
 stream functionality, a Meta-Object Protocol, and an ability to run
 external processes.
 .
 To browse SBCL source definitions with development environments,
 install the sbcl-source package. For documentation on SBCL's usage
 and internals, the package sbcl-doc is provided.
