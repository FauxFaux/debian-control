Description: WBEM Command Line Interface for CIMOM access
 The WBEM Command Line Interface is a standalone, convenient systems
 management utility for CIMOM access. Invocation and output syntax are
 problem-oriented and easy to process by shell and Perl scripts, making
 wbemcli well suited for administrators writing their own management
 scripts and for WBEM developers wanting to test their providers.
 .
 WBEM (Web-Based Enterprise Management) is a successor of SNMP and the
 basis of SMI-S (Storage Management Initiative - a standard interface
 to storage devices).  CIM (Common Information Model, the data model of
 WBEM) has a much wider scope, thus more ambitious projects like
 OpenPegasus exist, but this simple utility from the SBLIM project is
 enough to query disk and RAID states of SMI-S compatible storage
 products from their CIM Object Manager, for example.
