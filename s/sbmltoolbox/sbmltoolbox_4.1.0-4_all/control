Description: libsbml toolbox for octave and matlab
 The SBMLToolbox provides a set of basic functions for reading, writing,
 manipulating, and simulating SBML (System Biology Meta Language)
 models. It is a free Open Source package on top of the libSBML with
 full compatibility to work with MATLAB and Octave alike and share models
 between the two systems.
 .
 The toolbox is not a complete turn key solution for Systems Biology.
 It has its emphasis on easing the handling of SBML data and serves
 as a starting point for users and developers to establish their own
 methods.
