Description: Daemon for automatically building Debian binary packages from Debian sources
 The sbuild suite of programs (buildd and sbuild) are
 used to build binary packages from source packages.  The wanna-build
 database tracks packages which require building; buildd schedules
 work from information it gets from the wanna-build database; sbuild
 does the actual package building.
 .
 buildd is a daemon which will build Debian packages automatically
 using the wanna-build database to identify which packages need to be
 built.  Note that the wanna-build database is not packaged, and
 requires installing separately.
