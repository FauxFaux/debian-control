Description: Text-based spreadsheet with VI-like keybindings
 "Spreadsheet Calculator" is a much modified version of the public-
 domain spread sheet sc, which was posted to Usenet several years ago
 by Mark Weiser as vc, originally by James Gosling. It is based on
 rectangular table much like a financial spreadsheet.
 .
 Its keybindings are familiar to users of 'vi', and it has most
 features that a pure spreadsheet would, but lacks things like
 graphing and saving in foreign formats.  It's very stable and quite
 easy to use once you've put a little effort into learning it.
