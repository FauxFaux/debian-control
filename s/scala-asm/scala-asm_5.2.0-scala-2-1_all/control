Description: Fork of ASM for the Scala Compiler
 This library is a fork of the ASM Java bytecode manipulation and analysis
 framework (see libasm-java) modified for the needs of the Scala compiler.
 The classes are relocated under the scala.tools.asm package and a small
 number of patches were applied to the original sources.
