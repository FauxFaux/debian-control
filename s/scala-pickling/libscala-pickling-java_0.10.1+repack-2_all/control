Description: Fast, customizable, boilerplate-free pickling support for Scala
 Scala Pickling is an automatic serialization framework made for Scala. It's
 fast, boilerplate-free, and allows users to easily swap in/out different
 serialization formats (such as binary, or JSON), or even to provide their own
 custom serialization format.
