Description: Scala library for describing binary protocols
 SBinary is a library for describing binary protocols, in the form
 of mappings between Scala types and binary formats. It can be used
 as a robust serialization mechanism for Scala objects or a way of
 dealing with existing binary formats found in the wild.
