Description: Scala programming language
 Scala is a Java-compatible programming language with many
 modern language features.  It is Java-compatible in that
 Scala and Java classes can directly reference each other and
 subclass each other with no glue code needed.  It
 includes modern language features such as closures,
 pattern-matching, parametric types, and virtual type members.
 .
 This package includes the various tools used to develop
 code written in Scala.  It includes a compiler (scalac),
 an interpreter and script runner (scala), the offline
 compiler (fsc), and source-scanning documentation
 generator (scaladoc).
