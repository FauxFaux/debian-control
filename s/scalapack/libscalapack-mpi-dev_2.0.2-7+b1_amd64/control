Description: Scalable Linear Algebra Package - Dev files for MPI
 ScaLAPACK is the parallel version of LAPACK used on clusters.
 .
 There are packages for the shared libraries, for the static libraries and
 the development files (this one) and for test programs.
 .
 Also included:
    - PBLAS, Parallel Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms
    - BLACS, Basic Linear Algebra Communication Subprograms
 .
 This is a dummy package which depends on the scalapack development package
 supporting the default implementation of MPI on this architecture.
