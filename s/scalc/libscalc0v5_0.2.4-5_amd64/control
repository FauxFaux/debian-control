Description: simple/symbolic calculation library
 SCalc is a C++ library for manipulation of mathematical
 expressions. It is possible to define functions, either using an
 expression or a C function. It is able to compute derivatives
 analytically, and is therefore suitable for implementing non-linear
 curve fitting with user-specified arbitrary functions.
