Description: fast filesystem-independent file recovery
 scalpel is a fast file carver that reads a database of header and footer
 definitions and extracts matching files from a set of image files or raw
 device files.
 .
 scalpel is filesystem-independent and will carve files from FAT16, FAT32,
 exFAT, NTFS, Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, JFS, XFS, ReiserFS, raw partitions, etc.
 .
 scalpel is a complete rewrite of the Foremost 0.69 file carver and is
 useful for both digital forensics investigations and file recovery.
