Description: development headers for scamper's binary dump file access library
 scamper is a program that is able to conduct Internet measurement
 tasks to large numbers of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, in parallel, to
 fill a specified packets-per-second rate. Currently, it supports the
 well-known ping and traceroute techniques, as well as MDA traceroute,
 alias resolution, some parts of tbit, sting, and neighbour discovery.
 .
 This package contains development headers and other ancillary files for the
 libscamperfile library.
