Description: locate and modify a variable in a running process (GUI)
 GameConqueror is a GUI based on Python and GTK+ using scanmem to locate
 the address of a variable in a running process. This can be used for the
 analysis or modification of a hostile process on a compromised machine, for
 reverse engineering, or as a "pokefinder" to cheat at video games.
 .
 GameConqueror provides a CheatEngine-alike user-friendly interface with more
 features than scanmem.
