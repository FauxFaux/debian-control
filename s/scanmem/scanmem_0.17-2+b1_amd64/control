Description: locate and modify a variable in a running process
 Scanmem is a simple interactive debugging utility for Linux, used to locate
 the address of a variable in a running process. This can be used for the
 analysis or modification of a hostile process on a compromised machine, for
 reverse engineering, or as a "pokefinder" to cheat at video games.
