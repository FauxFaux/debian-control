Description: interactive post-processing tool for scanned pages
 Scan Tailor is an interactive post-processing tool for scanned pages. It
 performs operations such as page splitting, deskewing, adding/removing
 borders, and others. You give it raw scans, and you get pages ready to be
 printed or assembled into a PDF or DJVU file. Scanning, optical character
 recognition, and assembling multi-page documents are out of scope of this
 project.
