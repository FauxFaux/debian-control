Description: Apache module implementing the SCGI protocol
 The SCGI protocol is a replacement for the Common Gateway
 Interface (CGI) protocol. It is a proposed standard for
 applications to interface with HTTP servers. It is similar to
 FastCGI but is designed to be easier to implement.
 .
 This package is an Apache module implementing the client side of
 the protocol.
