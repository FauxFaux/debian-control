Description: Queries/alters process' scheduling policy and CPU affinity
 Schedtool can query or alter a process' scheduling policy in Linux,
 specifically assigning SCHED_NORMAL, _FIFO, _RR, _BATCH, _ISO or _IDLEPRIO. It
 can set static priority for _FIFO and _RR. Setting CPU-affinity and (re)nicing
 is also possible, making schedtool the definitive interface to Linux scheduler.
 .
 It can be used to avoid skips and glitches in A/V applications, to lock
 processes onto given CPUs on SMP/NUMA systems, which may be beneficial for
 networking or benchmarks, or to adjust nice-levels of lesser important jobs to
 maintain a high amount of interactive responsiveness under high load. It is
 also handy to manage realtime processes.
 .
 If you don't know about scheduling policies, you probably don't want to use
 this program - or learn and read "man sched_setscheduler".
 .
 Some supported scheduling policies (such as SCHED_ISO, or SCHED_IDLEPRIO) need
 a patched kernel (eg. Con Kolivas' -ck patchset).
