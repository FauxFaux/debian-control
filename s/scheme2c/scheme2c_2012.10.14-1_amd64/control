Description: Joel Bartlett's fabled Scheme->C system
 The original Scheme->C system, the first of its kind.  It conforms to
 the R4RS Scheme standard, and compiles Scheme sources to C as an
 intermediate step, allowing easy integration with external libraries.
 Also included is an interpreter, for development, along with some X11
 interfaces and an X11-enabled interpreter.  Due to a variety of
 clever techniques, the system is quite fast.
