Description: command line tool to configure schleuder mailing lists
 Schleuder-cli enables creating, configuring, and deleting schleuder mailing
 lists, subscriptions, keys, etc.
 .
 It uses the Schleuder API, provided by schleuder-api-daemon (part of
 Schleuder).
 .
 Authentication and TLS-verification are mandatory. You need an API-key and the
 fingerprint of the TLS-certificate of the Schleuder API, respectively. Both
 should be provided by the API operators.
 .
 schleuder-cli does *not* authorize access. Only people who are supposed to have
 full access to all lists should be allowed to use it on/with your server.
