Description: parser for Schrödinger Maestro files
 Maestro is a commercial "all-purpose molecular modeling environment",
 produced and distributed by the company Schrödinger. Maestro has its
 own cognate file format, typically associated with the ".mae" file
 extension. This package provides an Open Source parser for the Maestro
 file format, released and maintained by the Maestro developers.
 .
 This facilitates a lossless transition from the widely accepted suite
 of Schrödinger into local custom developments or the Open Source world
 at large. Maeparser handles output from:
  * Molecular Dynamics applications, such as Desmond and FEP+
  * Ligand-Protein Docking applications, such as Glide
  * Homology Modeling and folding applications, such as Prime
  * Ligand-based search applications, such as Phase and Phase Shape
  * Quantum Mechanics applications, such as Jaguar
  * Protein-Protein Docking applications
  * ... many other backends used in both Life and Material Sciences
