Description: common files for schroot
 schroot allows users to execute commands or interactive shells in
 different chroots.  Any number of named chroots may be created, and
 access permissions given to each, including root access for normal
 users, on a per-user or per-group basis.  Additionally, schroot can
 switch to a different user in the chroot, using PAM for
 authentication and authorisation.  All operations are logged for
 security.
 .
 This package provides translations for localisation of schroot
 programs.
