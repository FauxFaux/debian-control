Description: contains spelling corrections for scid chess databases
 spelling corrections for maintaining scid chess databases. They can be
 used to correct and identify player names, events and ratings in chess
 databases. This is necessary, because large databases come from various
 sources and only with spell corrected files there is a chance to identify
 duplicate database entries.
