Description: Scientific software package for numerical computations (minimal binary files)
 Scilab is a matrix-based scientific software package.
 Scilab contains hundreds of built-in mathematical functions, rich
 data structures (including polynomials, rationals, linear systems, lists,
 etc...) and comes with a number of specific toolboxes for
 control, signal processing, ...
 .
 This package also provides Xcos, a graphical editor to design hybrid
 dynamical systems models. Models can be designed, loaded, saved, compiled and
 simulated.
 Stable and efficient solution for industrial and academics needs, Xcos
 provides functionalities for modeling of mechanical systems (automotive,
 aeronautics...), hydraulic circuits (dam, pipe modeling...), control systems,
 etc. Modelica capabilities are also provided.
 .
 This package contains the architecture specific binary files.
 All mandatory libraries for scilab-cli are shipped in this package.
 Please install the package "scilab" to have all features.
