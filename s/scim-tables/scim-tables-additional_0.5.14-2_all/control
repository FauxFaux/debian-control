Description: miscellaneous input method data tables for SCIM platform
 SCIM (Smart Common Input Method) is an input method (IM) platform.
 .
 This package contains SCIM input method data tables for non-CJK languages.
 The currently supported languages are Amharic, Arabic, Nepali, Russian, Thai,
 Ukrainian, Vietnamese, and several Indic languages (Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi,
 Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu).  It also provides support for
 X-SAMPA and LaTeX style input.
 .
 Note many table-based input methods provided in this package are very
 primitive, and probably doesn't fit native speakers' need.  Users
 should also look at scim-m17n package (which uses M17N library) and see
 if it provides better support to the language he/she needs.
 .
 For details about SCIM, please see the description of package scim.
