Description: Japanese input method data tables for SCIM platform
 SCIM (Smart Common Input Method) is an input method (IM) platform.
 .
 This package contains SCIM table-based input method data for Japanese.
 Currently the provided tables are Hiragana, Katagana, and Nippon.
 .
 Note the table-based Japanese input method provided in this package is
 very primitive, probably only useful for people just start learning
 Japanese, and most certainly doesn't fit native speakers' need.  Users
 who need to input Japanese all the time should look at other SCIM
 modules for Japanese, such as scim-anthy package.
 .
 For details about SCIM, please see the description of package scim.
