Description: widget for scientific plotting
 The SciPlot Widget is a widget capable of plotting Cartesian or polar
 graphs, including logarithmic axes in Cartesian plots.  The widget is
 subclassed directly from the Core widget class, which means that it does
 not depend upon any other widget set.  It may be freely used with Athena,
 Motif, or the Open Look/Xview widget sets.  (There is optional Motif
 support that causes the widget to be subclassed from XmPrimitive.  See
 the man page.)
 .
 Features provided in the widget include automatic scaling, legend drawing,
 axis labeling, PostScript output, multiple plotted lines, color support,
 user font specification, dashed lines, symbols drawn at points, logarithmic
 scales on one or both axes in Cartesian plots, and degrees or radians as
 angles in polar plots.
