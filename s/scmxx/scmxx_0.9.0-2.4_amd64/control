Description: Exchange data with Siemens mobile phones
 SCMxx is a console program that allows you to exchange certain types of
 data with mobile phones made by Siemens. Some of the data types that can
 be exchanged are logos, ring tones, vCalendars, phonebook entries, and
 SMS messages. It works with the S25, S35i, M35i and C35i, SL45, S45 and
 ME45 and probably others.
 .
 You need a serial connection (either cable or infrared) to your mobile
 phone in order to use SCMxx.
 .
 It basically uses the AT command set published by Siemens
 (with some other, additional resources).
