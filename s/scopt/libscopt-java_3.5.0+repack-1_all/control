Description: Simple scala command line options parsing
 Scopt provides two styles of parsing: immutable and mutable.
 In immutable parsing style, a config object is passed around as an argument
 into action callbacks. On the other hand, in mutable parsing style you are
 expected to modify the config object in place.
