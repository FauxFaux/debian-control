Description: Spell-Checker Oriented Word Lists
 The SCOWL is a collection of word lists organized by word popularity,
 language, word class, and other factors.  These lists can be
 combined in various ways (or used individually) for spell checking
 and similar purposes.
 .
 The Debian wamerican*, wbritish*, and wcanadian* wordlist packages
 are built from (appropriate collections of) these same lists.  Install
 one (or more) of those packages if you want a comprehensive word list;
 install scowl if you (also) want to pick and choose the pieces that
 comprise those lists.
 .
