Description: British English dictionary words for /usr/share/dict
 This package provides the file /usr/share/dict/british-english-huge
 containing a list of English words with British spellings.
 This list can be used by spelling checkers, and by programs such
 as look(1).
 .
 This is an even larger list than the one installed by wbritish-large;
 nothing prevents you installing both (and others) at the same time.
 .
 There are also -small and standard versions of this word list,
 and there are wamerican* and wcanadian* packages as well.
