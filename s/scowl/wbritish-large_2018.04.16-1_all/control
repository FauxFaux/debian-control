Description: British English dictionary words for /usr/share/dict
 This package provides the file /usr/share/dict/british-english-large
 containing a list of English words with British spellings.
 This list can be used by spelling checkers, and by programs such
 as look(1).
 .
 This is a larger list than the one installed by wbritish; nothing
 prevents you installing both (and others) at the same time.
 .
 There are also -small and -huge versions of this word list,
 and there are wamerican* and wcanadian* packages as well.
