Description: Canadian English dictionary words for /usr/share/dict
 This package provides the file /usr/share/dict/canadian-english-insane
 containing a list of English words with Canadian spellings.
 This list can be used by spelling checkers, and by programs such
 as look(1).
 .
 This is an even larger list than the one installed by wcanadian-huge,
 and possibly contains invalid words (as well as words that are very
 uncommon). Nothing prevents you installing both (and others) at the
 same time.
 .
 There are also -small and standard versions of this word list,
 and there are wbritish* and wamerican* packages as well.
