Description: advanced ircII-based IRC client
 ScrollZ is advanced IRC client based on ircII code. It adds features
 normally found in ircII scripts like Toolz, PhoEniX, GargOyle or Lice.
 .
 The main difference between these scripts and ScrollZ is the code. Where
 ircII scripts take a lot of disk and memory space and run slow, ScrollZ
 only takes a couple of extra kilobytes compared to stock ircII client
 yet runs faster than any ircII script. This was accomplished by using
 C code instead of ircII scripting language. This reduces memory and
 CPU usage and code tends to run way faster.
