Description: IMCCE SCSCP C Library -- development package
 SCSCP stands for Symbolic Computation Software Composibility Protocol.
 This protocol is developed by the European project SCIEnce - Symbolic
 Computation Infrastructure for Europe: http://www.symbolic-computing.org
 .
 This C/C++ library, which is developed by the French Institute of
 Celestial Mechanics and Ephemeridesis Calculus (IMCCE) consists
 of an implementation of the SCSCP protocol. It provides an Application
 Programming Interface (API) to develop client and server applications
 to communicate with systems that support the SCSCP protocol, mainly
 Computer Algebra Systems (CAS).
 .
 This package contains the header files, static libraries and symbolic
 links that developers using the SCSCP library developed at IMCCE will
 need.
