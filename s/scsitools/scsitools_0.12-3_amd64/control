Description: Collection of tools for SCSI hardware management
 This package is a collection of tools for manipulating SCSI hardware:
 .
  scsiinfo: displays SCSI drive low-level information and modifies SCSI
            drive settings,
  scsidev: makes permanent SCSI LUN -> devicename connections,
  scsifmt: low-level SCSI formatter,
  sraw: benchmarks raw SCSI I/O rates bypassing the buffer cache,
  scsi-spin: program to manually spin up and down a SCSI device.
 .
 Beware that, to be used properly, these tools require some knowledge of
 what they're doing as they can cause damage to your system.
