Description: Simple Document Parser
 SDF (Simple Document Format) is a freely available document development
 system which generates high quality outputs in a variety of formats
 from a single source. The output formats supported include
 PostScript(tm), PDF, HTML, plain text, POD, man pages, LaTeX,
 MIF, SGML, Windows(tm) help, RTF, MIMS F6 help and MIMS HTX help.
 If the idea of specifying documents in a logical manner via a
 simple markup language sounds appealing, SDF may be useful to you.
