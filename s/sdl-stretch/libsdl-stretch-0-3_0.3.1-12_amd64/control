Description: stretch functions for Simple DirectMedia Layer
 This library provides stretch and blit routines for SDL surfaces.

 in the general routines and dynamic cpu native code generation
 for applications to compile specialized stretch-and-blit routines
 at runtime.
 .
 This package contains the SDL_stretch runtime library.
