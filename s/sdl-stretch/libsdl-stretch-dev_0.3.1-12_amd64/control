Description: development files for SDL_stretch library
 This library provides stretch and blit routines for SDL surfaces.
 These are optimized for speed including lots of assembler parts
 in the general routines and dynamic cpu native code generation
 for applications to compile specialized stretch-and-blit routines
 at runtime.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static library needed to
 compile applications that use SDL_stretch.
