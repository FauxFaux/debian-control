Description: text rendering with Pango in SDL applications (development)
 SDL_pango is a Simple Directmedia Layer extension for rendering text
 with the Pango library. Its use cases are similar to those of SDL_ttf,
 but it benefits from the superior Pango font selection engine for
 improved rendering of internationalized text.
 .
 This package contains the static library and development headers needed
 to build applications using SDL_pango.
