Description: Service Data Objects 2.1 Java API spec
 SDO is a framework for data application development, which
 includes an architecture and API. SDO does the following:
 .
  - Simplifies the J2EE data programming model
  - Abstracts data in a service oriented architecture (SOA)
  - Unifies data application development
  - Supports and integrates XML
  - Incorporates J2EE patterns and best practices
 .
 With SDO, you do not need to be familiar with a
 technology-specific API in order to access and utilize data.
 You need to know only one API, the SDO API, which lets you
 work with data from multiple data sources, including
 relational databases, entity EJB components, XML pages, Web
 services, the Java Connector Architecture, JavaServer Pages
 pages, and more.
 .
 This package contains only a Java API of SDO 2.1 spec.
 EclipseLink is a implementation of this spec.
