Description: Semidefinite program solver (documentation)
 SDPB is an open-source, arbitrary-precision, parallelized semidefinite
 program solver, designed for the conformal bootstrap. SDPB significantly
 outperforms less specialized solvers and should enable many new computations.
 .
 For more information, see "A Semidefinite Program Solver for the Conformal
 Bootstrap" at http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02033.
 .
 This package contains the manual and example files, including a Mathematica
 file with code to export semidefinite programs in the XML-based format used
 by SDPB.
