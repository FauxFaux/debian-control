Description: common files and documentation for searchandrescue
 Tired of scores indicating things destroyed or lives snuffed? Try something
 different -- fly a helicopter around and rescue people in distress. If you
 were in trouble wouldn't you want someone to rescue you?
 .
 This package contains the documentation and architecture independent
 (common) files.
