Description: fly aircraft to search (for) and rescue people in distress
 Tired of scores indicating things destroyed or lives snuffed? Try something
 different -- fly a helicopter around and rescue people in distress. If you
 were in trouble wouldn't you want someone to rescue you?
 .
 This game is intended for players of all audiences, but especially for mature
 players who want to get away from the violence and still retain a level of
 precise challenge. Flight difficulty can be lowered for beginners (regardless
 of mission type), and graphics minimized to suit slower computers
 (minimum Pentium 166 with no graphics acceleration).
