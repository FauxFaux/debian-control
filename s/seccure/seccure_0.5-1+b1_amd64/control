Description: tools for using algorithms based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)
 The seccure toolset implements a selection of asymmetric algorithms
 based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). In particular, it offers
 public key encryption / decryption and signature generation /
 verification. ECC schemes offer a much better key size to security
 ratio than classical systems (RSA, DSA). Keys are short enough to make
 direct specification of keys on the command line possible (sometimes
 this is more convenient than the management of PGP-like key
 rings). seccure builds on this feature and therefore is the tool of
 choice whenever lightweight asymmetric cryptography -- independent of
 key servers, revocation certificates, the Web of Trust, or even
 configuration files -- is required.
 .
 The toolkit implements Diffie-Hellman key exchange, allowing you to agree a
 key with another party over an insecure channel. The Diffie Helman protocol
 affords forward secrecy, and requires no previous contact with the other
 party.
 .
 The seccure toolset allows you to select the curve that the operations are
 performed on, so that different cryptographic needs can be supported. This
 is currently the only ECC package in Debian GNU/Linux to offer a choice of
 curves and MAC lengths.
 .
 It is currently missing some of the functionality of the sks-ecc package,
 including encrypting to multiple recipients at once, and creating different
 signature formats.
