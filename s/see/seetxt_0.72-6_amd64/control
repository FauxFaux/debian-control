Description: lightweight text file and man page viewer
 See is a lightweight Linux text file and man page viewer. It maintains
 "document meta-data" for each user, allowing them to automatically keep
 bookmarks and highlights for read-only system files. It also has a
 "server mode" so that command line requests can be sent to a single
 running server rather than starting multiple instances. Other features
 include hypertext-style apropos (man page) searches, file monitoring,
 regular expressions, command history, and nice little
 toggle lights on the interface for the server and file monitor.
