Description: Firefox WebDriver support
 WebDriver is designed to provide a simpler, more concise programming interface
 in addition to addressing some limitations in the Selenium-RC API.
 Selenium-WebDriver was developed to better support dynamic web pages where
 elements of a page may change without the page itself being reloaded.
 WebDriverâ€™s goal is to supply a well-designed object-oriented API that provides
 improved support for modern advanced web-app testing problems.
