 Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux® kernel and a number

 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access Control,
 and Multi-level Security.
