Description: Commandline tool to allow sending arbitrary IP packets
 SendIP has a large number of command line options to specify the
 content of every header of a RIP, TCP, UDP, ICMP or raw IPv4 and IPv6
 packet. It also allows any data to be added to the packet. Checksums
 can be calculated automatically, but if you wish to send out wrong
 checksums, that is supported too.
