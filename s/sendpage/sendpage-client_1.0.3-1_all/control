Description: client to send alpha-numeric text pages via SNPP
 To send alphanumeric pages to a pager, if an email gateway is unavailable
 or undesirable, software is needed to control a modem which will dial a
 Paging Central, and deliver the pages using an ASCII delivery system known
 as TAP. Sendpage implements all aspects of this type of software,
 including an SNPP client, an SNPP server, a queuing engine, a modem
 control engine, a TAP communication system, and an email notification system.
 .
 This package provides the sendpage SNPP client.
