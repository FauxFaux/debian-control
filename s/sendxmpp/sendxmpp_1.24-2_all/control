Description: command line XMPP (jabber) utility
 sendxmpp is a perl script to send text XMPP (jabber) messages, similar
 to what mail(1) and sendmail(1) does for mail.
 .
 sendxmpp is useful for monitoring remote servers (it can warn sending
 xmpp-messages), and watching VCS commit messages (developers are all
 connected to a XMPP-chatroom to which messages are sent.
 .
 XMPP is an open, non-proprietary protocol for instant messaging. See
 www.jabber.org for more information.
