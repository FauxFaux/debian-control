Description: C++ library for the analysis of biological sequences
 SeqAn is a C++ template library of efficient algorithms and data
 structures for the analysis of sequences with the focus on
 biological data. This library applies a unique generic design that
 guarantees high performance, generality, extensibility, and
 integration with other libraries. SeqAn is easy to use and
 simplifies the development of new software tools with a minimal loss
 of performance. This package contains the applications dfi, pair_align,
 micro_razers, seqan_tcoffee, seqcons, razers and tree_recon.
