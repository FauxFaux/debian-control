Description: multiple sequence alignment viewer and phylogenetic tool
 Belvu is a multiple sequence alignment viewer and phylogenetic tool with
 an extensive set of user-configurable modes to color residues.
 .
  * View multiple sequence alignments.
  * Residues can be coloured by conservation, with user-configurable
    cutoffs and colours.
  * Residues can be coloured by residue type (user-configurable).
  * Colour schemes can be imported or exported.
  * Swissprot (or PIR) entries can be fetched by double clicking.
  * The position in the alignment can be easily tracked.
  * Manual deletion of rows and columns.
  * Automatic editing of rows and columns based on customisable criteria:
     - removal of all-gap columns;
     - removal of all gaps;
     - removal of redundant sequences;
     - removal of a column by a user-specified percentage of gaps;
     - filtering of sequences by percent identity;
     - removal of sequences by a user-specified percentage of gaps;
     - removal of partial sequences (those starting or ending with
       gaps); and
     - removal of columns by conservation (with user-specified
       upper/lower cutoffs).
  * The alignment can be saved in Stockholm, Selex, MSF or FASTA format.
  * Distance matrices between sequences can be generated using a variety
    of distance metrics.
  * Distance matrices can be imported or exported.
  * Phylogenetic trees can be constructed based on various distance-based
    tree reconstruction algorithms.
  * Trees can be saved in New Hampshire format.
  * Belvu can perform bootstrap phylogenetic reconstruction.
