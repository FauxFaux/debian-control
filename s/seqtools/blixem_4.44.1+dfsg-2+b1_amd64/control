Description: interactive browser of sequence alignments
 Blixem is an interactive browser of sequence alignments that have been
 stacked up in a "master-slave" multiple alignment; it is not a 'true'
 multiple alignment but a 'one-to-many' alignment.
 .
  * Overview section showing the positions of genes and alignments around
    the alignment window
  * Detail section showing the actual alignment of protein or nucleotide
    sequences to the genomic DNA sequence.
  * View alignments against both strands of the reference sequence.
  * View sequences in nucleotide or protein mode; in protein mode, Blixem
    will display the three-frame translation of the reference sequence.
  * Residues are highlighted in different colours depending on whether
    they are an exact match, conserved substitution or mismatch.
  * Gapped alignments are supported, with insertions and deletions being
    highlighted in the match sequence.
  * Matches can be sorted and filtered.
  * SNPs and other variations can be highlighted in the reference
    sequence.
  * Poly(A) tails can be displayed and poly(A) signals highlighted in the
    reference sequence.
