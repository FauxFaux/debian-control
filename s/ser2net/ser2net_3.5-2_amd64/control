Description: Serial port to network proxy
 This daemon allows telnet and tcp sessions to be established with a
 host's serial ports. Combined with a terminal emulator, this can be a
 very simple means to configure network devices or other equipment with
 a serial port. This is remarkably similar to the reverse telnet
 feature of some Cisco routers.
