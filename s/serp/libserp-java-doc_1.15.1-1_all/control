Description: Documentation for libserp-java
 Documentation of the serp bytecode framework that has as goal to tap the full
 power of bytecode modification while lowering its associated costs.
 .
 The framework provides a set of high-level APIs for manipulating all aspects
 of bytecode, from large-scale structures like class member fields to the
 individual instructions that comprise the code of methods.
 .
 While in order to perform any advanced manipulation, some understanding of the
 class file format and especially of the JVM instruction set is necessary, the
 framework makes it as easy as possible to enter the world of bytecode
 development.
