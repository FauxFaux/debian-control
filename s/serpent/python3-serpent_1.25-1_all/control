Description: simple serialization library based on ast.literal_eval(), Python3 modules
 Serpent provides ast.literal_eval() compatible object tree serialization.
 It serializes an object tree into bytes (utf-8 encoded string) that can be
 decoded and then passed as-is to ast.literal_eval() to rebuild it as the
 original object tree.
 As such it is safe to send serpent data to other machines over the network
 for instance (because only 'safe' literals are encoded).
 .
 This package contains the core Serpent module for Python 3.x .
