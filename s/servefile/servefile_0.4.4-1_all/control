Description: serve or receive files from shell via a small HTTP server
 servefile is a small HTTP-server intended for temporary file transfer mostly
 in the local network. By default the server redirects all HTTP requests to a
 file given as first argument, so only IP and port must be given to another
 user to access it.
 .
 servefile is also able to list directories, generate SSL certificates for
 HTTPS on-the-fly, do HTTP basic auth and provide a platform for uploads
 via either a HTML formular or a simple POST/PUT.
 .
 Note that this HTTP-server's purpose is not production grade static file
 serving or running as a daemon.
