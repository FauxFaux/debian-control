Description: Jar daemon wrapper
 The Java Service Wrapper makes very easy to install a Java Application as a
 daemon process on Unix systems. The Wrapper monitors a JVM (Java Virtual
 Machine) process and automatically restarts it if it that the JVM has crashed
 or hung. This process takes just a few seconds once the Wrapper has decided
 there is a problem. It also gives the ability to handle process priority.
