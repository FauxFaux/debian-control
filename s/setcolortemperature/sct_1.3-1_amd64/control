Description: Set screen color temperature
 sct is a small C program to change the screen color temperature. It
 can be used to reduce or increase the amount of blue light produced
 by the screen.
 .
 sct sets the color temperature of the screen via xrandr like redshift.
 Unlike redshift, it is only 80 lines of C and will not change the
 screen temperature automatically.
