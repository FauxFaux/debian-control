Description: Library for ISO 19107:2013 and OGC SFA 1.2 for 3D operations (development)
 SFCGAL is a C++ wrapper library around CGAL with the aim of
 supporting ISO 19107:2013 and OGC Simple Features Access 1.2 for 3D
 operations.
 .
 SFCGAL provides standard compliant geometry types and operations,
 that can be accessed from its C or C++ APIs. PostGIS uses the C API,
 to expose some SFCGAL's functions in spatial databases (cf. PostGIS
 manual).
 .
 This package provides the development files.
