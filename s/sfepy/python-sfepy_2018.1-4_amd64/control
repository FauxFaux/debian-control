Description: Simple Finite Elements in Python
 SfePy is a software for solving systems of coupled partial differential
 equations (PDEs) by the finite element method in 1D, 2D and 3D.
 It can be viewed both as black-box PDE solver, and as a Python package
 which can be used for building custom applications. The word “simple”
 means that complex FEM problems can be coded very easily and rapidly.
