Description: MPEG 4 Structured Audio decoder
 Sfront compiles MPEG 4 Structured Audio (MP4-SA) bitstreams into
 efficient C programs that generate audio when executed. It supports
 real-time, low-latency audio input/output, MIDI input from
 soundcards, and Network Musical Performance.
 .
 MP4-SA is a standard for normative algorithmic sound, that combines
 an audio signal processing language (SAOL) with score languages
 (SASL, and the legacy MIDI File Format).
 .
 This package includes the sfront application, the sfront manual and
 "The MPEG-4 Structured Audio Book", a book on sound modeling and
 sequencing using MP4-SA.
