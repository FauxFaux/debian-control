Description: Stuttgart finite-state transducer tools
 SFST is a toolbox for the implementation of morphological analysers
 and other tools which are based on finite state transducer
 technology. The SFST tools comprise
 .
   * a compiler which translates transducer programs into minimised transducers
   * interactive and batch-mode analysis programs
   * tools for comparing and printing transducers
   * a C++ library which is efficient and easy to use
