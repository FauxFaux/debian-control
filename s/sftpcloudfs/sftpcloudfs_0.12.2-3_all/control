Description: SFTP interface to Rackspace/OpenStack storage services
 This package provides an SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) interface to
 Rackspace Cloud Files and OpenStack Object Storage, acting as a proxy between
 an SFTP client and a remote storage service.
 .
 The username/password pair used to open the SFTP session is validated using the
 authentication service of the storage service to get an authentication
 token.
 .
 The communication between the client and the SFTP daemon is encrypted all the
 time, and the SFTP service supports HTTPS communication with the remote
 storage service.
