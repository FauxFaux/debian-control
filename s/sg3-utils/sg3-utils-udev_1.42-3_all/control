Description: utilities for devices using the SCSI command set (udev rules)
 Most OSes have SCSI pass-through interfaces that enable user space programs
 to send SCSI commands to a device and fetch the response. With SCSI to ATA

 commands are defined in the draft standards at www.t13.org . For a mapping
 between supported SCSI and ATA commands and utility names in this package
