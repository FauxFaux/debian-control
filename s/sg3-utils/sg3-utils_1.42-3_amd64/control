Description: utilities for devices using the SCSI command set
 Most OSes have SCSI pass-through interfaces that enable user space programs
 to send SCSI commands to a device and fetch the response. With SCSI to ATA
 Translation (SAT) many ATA disks now can process SCSI commands. Typically
 each utility in this package implements one SCSI command. See the draft
 standards at www.t10.org for SCSI command definitions plus SAT. ATA
 commands are defined in the draft standards at www.t13.org . For a mapping
 between supported SCSI and ATA commands and utility names in this package
 see the COVERAGE file.
