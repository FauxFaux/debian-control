Description: de novo genome assembler that uses string graphs
 The major goal of SGA is to be very memory efficient, which is achieved by
 using a compressed representation of DNA sequence reads.
 .
 SGA is a de novo assembler for DNA sequence reads. It is based on Gene Myers'
 string graph formulation of assembly and uses the FM-index/Burrows-Wheeler
 transform to efficiently find overlaps between sequence reads.
