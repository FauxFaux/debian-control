Description: The Stanford GraphBase: combinatorial data and algorithms
 A highly portable collection of programs and data for researchers who
 study combinatorial algorithms and data structures.
 .
 The programs are intended to be interesting in themselves as examples
 of literate programming.  Thus, the Stanford GraphBase can also be
 regarded as a collection of approximately 30 essays for programmers
 to enjoy reading, whether or not they are doing algorithmic research.
 The programs are written in CWEB, a combination of TeX and C that is
 easy to use by anyone who knows those languages and easy to read by
 anyone familiar with the rudiments of C.
 .
 This package contains only the libraries and the demonstration
 programs; for the readable source code, which forms the documentation
 as well, see the sgb-doc package.
