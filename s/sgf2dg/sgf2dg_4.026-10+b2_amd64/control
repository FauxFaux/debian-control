Description: Creates TeX files from Go game records
 Go is a board game from Eastern Asia and TeX is a program for
 typesetting.  sgf2dg converts Go game records in smart-go format (SGF)
 into TeX files.  You can produce camera-ready copies for books or
 magazines, or simply generate attractive printouts of your (internet)
 Go games.
 .
 sgf2dg includes the Metafont sources for a new set of Go fonts, and a
 script, sgf2dg (formerly sgf2tex), which translates files in sgf-format
 into TeX.
