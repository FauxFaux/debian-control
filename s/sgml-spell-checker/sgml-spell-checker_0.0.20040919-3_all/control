Description: spell checker for SGML documents
 This package includes a couple of tools that you can use to
 automatically spell-check your SGML documents. One of the
 advantages of this tool over some other SGML-aware spell
 checkers is that it scans your documents in the form in which
 the SGML parser actually sees it, which means it is not line-based,
 system entities are resolved, marked sections are treated appropriately, etc.
 .
 Also, this tool can be made aware of particular DTDs, in the
 sense that it knows not to spell-check the content of elements
 that do not represent human-language text, such as <programlisting>
 in DocBook. An exclusion list for the DocBook DTD is included, others
 can be added trivially.
