Description: Configuration and Release management using AtFS
 ShapeTools is a collection of programs to support software
 configuration management in an UNIX environment. It consists of a set
 of version and attribute control commands, and a configuration
 interpreter and build tool ("shape"). The toolkit is integrated on top
 of the Attributed File System (AtFS).
 .
 ShapeTools is designed to live meaningfully together
 with any other UNIX tool operating on regular files. This distribution
 also contains a prototype for a comprehensive change control and
 release management system designed to manage the evolution of system
 releases in multi programmer software development efforts.
