Description: shell-like interface for browsing LDAP servers and editing their content
 Shelldap lets you browse and edit an LDAP tree as if it were a filesystem.  It
 keeps command history, has sane autocompletes, credential caching, site-wide
 and individual configs, and it's fun to say. Shelldap! Shelldap! Shelldap!
