Description: shell-based launcher
 shellex is supposed to be a dmenu-style launcher with a lot more
 features and a lot simpler design. It launches a shell (currently zsh)
 and shows it in a small terminal, wrapping every command with a little
 bit of extra magic (redirecting stdout, stderr, disowning and closing
 the shell) to get more typical launcher-behaviour.
 .
 This gives you a simple launcher with tab-completion and other
 shell-features, configurable in shell.
