Description: test command-line programs or arbitrary shell commands
 shelltestrunner is a cross-platform tool for testing command-line
 programs (or arbitrary shell commands). It reads simple declarative
 tests specifying a command, some input, and the expected output,
 error output and exit status. Tests can be run selectively, in
 parallel, with a timeout, in color, and/or with differences
 highlighted.
