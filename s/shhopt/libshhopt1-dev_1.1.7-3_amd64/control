Description: Command line option parser - development
 This is Sverre H. Huseby's library for parsing command line options.
 .
 Both traditional one-character options and GNU-style --long-options
 are supported. This library does a little more than standard getopt.
 .
 This package contains what you need for compiling sources that
 use this library.
