Description: Federated web single sign-on system (development)
 The Shibboleth System is a standards based software
 package for web single sign-on across or within organizational boundaries.
 It supports authorization and attribute exchange using the OASIS SAML 2.0
 protocol.  Shibboleth allows sites to make informed authorization decisions
 for individual access of protected online resources while allowing users to
 establish their identities with their local authentication systems.
 .
 This package contains the headers and other necessary files to build
 applications that use the Shibboleth SP library.
