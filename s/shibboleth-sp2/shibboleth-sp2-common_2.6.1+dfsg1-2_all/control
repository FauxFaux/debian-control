Description: Federated web single sign-on system (common files)
 The Shibboleth System is a standards based software package for web
 single sign-on across or within organizational boundaries.  It supports
 authorization and attribute exchange using the OASIS SAML 2.0 protocol.
 Shibboleth allows sites to make informed authorization decisions for
 individual access of protected online resources while allowing users to
 establish their identities with their local authentication systems.
 .
 This package contains common files used by the Shibboleth SP library,
 Apache module, and daemon, primarily configuration files and schemas.
