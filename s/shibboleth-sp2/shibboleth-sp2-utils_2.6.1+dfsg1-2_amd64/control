Description: Federated web single sign-on system (daemon and utilities)
 The Shibboleth System is a standards based software package for web
 single sign-on across or within organizational boundaries.  It supports
 authorization and attribute exchange using the OASIS SAML 2.0 protocol.
 Shibboleth allows sites to make informed authorization decisions for
 individual access of protected online resources while allowing users to
 establish their identities with their local authentication systems.
 .
 This package contains the daemon that handles attribute requests and
 maintains session information for the SP.  It is used internally by the
 Apache module (libapache2-mod-shib2), but may be useful independently in
 some circumstances.  It also contains some other useful Shibboleth SP
 utility programs and the FastCGI authorizer and responder.
