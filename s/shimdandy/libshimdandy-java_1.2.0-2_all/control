Description: Shim wrapping multiple Clojure runtimes into the same JVM
 A Clojure runtime shim, allowing for multiple Clojure runtimes in the same JVM.
 .
 Clojure has a static runtime (implemented as static methods off of
 clojure.lang.RT), so to run multiple runtimes in the same JVM, they
 have to be loaded in isolated ClassLoader trees. ShimDandy provides a
 mechanism for isolating the runtimes within a non-Clojure application,
 and for calling in to the runtimes from the app.
