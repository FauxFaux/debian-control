Description: Debugging symbols for Shishi
 Shishi is an implementation of the kerberos v5 network authentication
 system.
 .
 This package contains detached debugging information.  Most people
 will not need this package.  It is provided primarily to provide a
 backtrace with names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat easier to
 interpret core dumps.  GDB will find this debug information
 automatically.
