Description: Command line client for the Shishi Kerberos v5 implementation
 Shishi is an implementation of the kerberos v5 network authentication
 system.
 .
 Shishi can be used to authenticate users in distributed systems.
 .
 Shishi contains a library ('libshishi') that can be used by
 application developers to add support for kerberos v5.  Shishi
 contains a command line utility ('shishi') that is used by users to
 acquire and manage tickets (and more).  The server side, a Key
 Distribution Center, is implemented by 'shishid'.  Of course, a
 manual documenting usage aspects as well as the programming API is
 included.
 .
 Shishi currently supports AS/TGS exchanges for acquiring tickets, the
 AP exchange for performing client and server authentication, and
 SAFE/PRIV for integrity/privacy protected application data exchanges.
 .
 Shishi is internationalized; error and status messages can be
 translated into the users' language; user name and passwords can be
 converted into any available character set (normally including
 ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8) and also be processed using an experimental
 Stringprep profile.
 .
 Most, if not all, of the widely used encryption and checksum types
 are supported, such as ARCFOUR, 3DES, AES and HMAC-SHA1.
 .
 This package includes a few command line tools:
  shishi -- Acquire and manage Kerberos tickets.
  keytab2shishi -- Convert MIT/Heimdal /etc/krb5.keytab's to Shishi format.
  ccache2shishi -- Convert MIT/Heimdal user ticket files to Shishi format.
