Description: portable shell tool from the GNU project
 GNU shtool is a tool for developers of software programs.
 It is a compilation of small but very stable and portable
 shell scripts into a single shell tool. All ingredients
 were in successful use over many years in various free
 software projects.
 .
 The compiled shtool program is intended to be used inside
 the source tree of other free software packages. There it
 can overtake various (usually non-portable) tasks related
 to the building and installation of such a package. It
 especially can replace the old mkdir.sh, install.sh and
 related scripts.
 .
 GNU shtool currently contains the following tools: echo,
 mdate, table, prop, move, install, mkdir, mkln, mkshadow,
 fixperm, rotate, tarball, subst, platform, arx, slo, scpp,
 version and path.
