Description: Qt program to shutdown/reboot/suspend/hibernate the system
 qshutdown is a Qt program to shutdown/reboot/suspend/hibernate the
 computer at a given time or after a certain number of minutes. It shows
 the time until the corresponding request is send to either the Gnome- or
 KDE-session-manager, to HAL or to DeviceKit and if none of these works
 the command 'sudo shutdown -P now' is used. This program may be useful
 for people who want to work with the computer only for a certain time.
