Description: SID (MOS 6581) emulation library
 This is a (shared) library that implements the emulation of the C64's
 SID chip (MOS 6581) and CPU (6510). It is used by several "player"
 applications, e.g. sidplay, which make it possible to listen to *really*
 a lot (13.600+) of tunes, known from old and new C64 programs (as well
 as Amiga compositions).
