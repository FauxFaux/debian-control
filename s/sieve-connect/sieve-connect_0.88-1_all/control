Description: MANAGESIEVE protocol client
 This is sieve-connect.  A client for the MANAGESIEVE protocol, as
 implemented by timsieved in Cyrus IMAP.

 sieve-connect is designed to be both a tool which can be invoked from
 scripts and also a decent interactive client.  It should also be a
 drop-in replacement for "sieveshell", as supplied with Cyrus IMAP.
