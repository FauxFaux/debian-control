Description: interthread communication library for C++ - runtime
 This library is an interthread communication library for C++ on top of
 libsigc++ and glibmm. It provides dispatcher based interthread communication,
 typesafe functor adaptors to execute functions in the context of another
 thread, threadsafe wrappers for signals and connections, and deadlock detection
 for synchronous messages.
 .
 This package contains the runtime files for libsigx, needed if you wish to run
 or compile software which depends on it.
