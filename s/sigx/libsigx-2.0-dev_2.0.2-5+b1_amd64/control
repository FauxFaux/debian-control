Description: interthread communication for C++ - development files
 This library is an interthread communication library for C++ on top of
 libsigc++ and glibmm. It provides dispatcher based interthread communication,
 typesafe functor adaptors to execute functions in the context of another
 thread, threadsafe wrappers for signals and connections, and deadlock detection
 for synchronous messages.
 .
 This package contains the development files for libsigx, needed only if you
 wish to write or compile software which uses it.
