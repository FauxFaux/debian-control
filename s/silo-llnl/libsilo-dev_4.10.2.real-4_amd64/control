Description: Development files for SILO Scientific I/O library from LLNL
 Silo is a library for reading and writing a wide variety of scientific data to
 binary, disk files. The files Silo produces and the data within them can be
 easily shared and exchanged between wholly independently developed applications
 running on disparate computing platforms. Consequently, Silo facilitates the
 development of general purpose tools for processing scientific data.
 One of the more popular tools that process Silo data files is the
 VisIt visualization tool.
 .
 Silo supports gridless (point) meshes, structured meshes, unstructured-zoo
 and unstructured-arbitrary-polyhedral meshes, block structured AMR meshes,
 constructive solid geometry (CSG) meshes, piecewise-constant
 (e.g. zone-centered) and piecewise-linear (e.g. node-centered) variables
 defined on the node, edge, face or volume elements of meshes as well as
 the decomposition of meshes into arbitrary subset hierarchies including
 materials and mixing materials. In addition, Silo supports a wide variety of
 other useful objects to address various scientific computing application
 needs. Although the Silo library is a serial library, it has some key features
 which enable it to be applied quite effectively and scalable in parallel.
 .
 Architecturally, the library is divided into two main pieces; an upper-level
 application programming interface (API) and a lower-level I/O implementation
 called a driver. Silo supports multiple I/O drivers, the two most common of
 which are the HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format 5) and PDB (Portable Data Base)
 drivers.
