  * histogramming
  * fitting
  * 1D and 2D visualization using multiple backends (matplotlib or OpenGL)
  * image plot widget with a set of associated tools (See changelog file).
  * Unified browser for HDF5, SPEC and image file formats supporting inspection
    and visualization of n-dimensional datasets.
  * Unified viewer (silx view filename) for HDF5, SPEC and image file formats
  * OpenGL-based widget to display 3D scalar field with
    isosurface and cutting plane.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version of the package.
