Description: Toolkit for scalable simulation of distributed applications
 SimGrid is a toolkit that provides core functionalities for the simulation of
 distributed applications in heterogeneous distributed environments. SimGrid
 can be used as a Grid simulator, a P2P simulator, a Cloud simulator, a MPI
 simulator, or a mix of all of them. The typical use-cases of SimGrid include
 heuristic evaluation, application prototyping, and real application
 development and tuning.
 .
 This package contains the dynamic libraries and runtime.
