Description: JavaScript library for web-based interactive timelines
 Timeline is a DHTML-based AJAX-based widget for visualizing time-based
 events. It uses the "slippy page" concept in a similar way to Google Maps
 allowing the user to pan the timeline by dragging the page horizontally.
 .
 Each timeline can consist of multiple "bands", each with a configurable
 scale, which can provide useful context when displaying a large number
 of items. Timelines can be populated directly via XML or JSON.
