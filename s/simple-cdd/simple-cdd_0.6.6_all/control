Description: create customized debian-installer CDs
 Simple-CDD is a limited though relatively easy tool to create a
 customized debian-installer CD.
 .
 It includes simple mechanisms to create "profiles" that define common
 system configurations, which can be selected during system
 installation. Simple-CDD also makes it easy to build CDs with
 language and country settings pre-configured.
 .
 This can be used to create a crude "Custom Debian Distribution" using
 packages from Debian, with pre-configuration of packages that use
 debconf.  Custom configuration scripts can be specified to handle
 packages that don't support debconf pre-configuration.
 .
 Testing CD images with qemu is also made simple with a provided
 script.
