Description: Documentation for libsimple-http-java
 The goal of Simple is to bring the power of simplicity to the world of server
 side Java. The primary focus of the project is to provide a truly embeddable
 Java based HTTP engine capable of handling enormous loads.
 .
 Simple provides a truly asynchronous service model, request completion is
 driven using an internal, transparent, monitoring system. This allows Simple
 to vastly outperform most popular Java based servers in a multi-tier
 environment, as it requires only a very limited number of threads to handle
 very high quantities of concurrent clients.
 .
 Simple has consistently out performed both commercial and open source Java
 Servlet engines and has a fully comprehensive API that is as usable for
 experienced Java developers as it is for beginners.
 .
 This package provides the API documentation for libsimple-http-java.
