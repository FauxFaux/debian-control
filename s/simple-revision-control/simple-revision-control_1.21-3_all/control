Description: single-file and single-user revision control system
 This package provides a powerful modern user interface for an RCS
 (and to some extend, SCCS) backend. It will be familiar to users
 with modern Subversion, Git, Hg experience, as well as a
 reasonable introduction to this toolset to novices.
 .
 SRC is designed to provide its strength for single-file, single-user
 version tracking. When it is overkill to make a whole directory and
 multi-file repository store (under, for example, Git or Hg), src can
 provide tracking for individual files instead.  Examples of such might
 be your ~/bin scripts, /etc files, personal notes, résumés, and any such
 file that would be awkward to contain in a wholly separate directory
 just for version control.
