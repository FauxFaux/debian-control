Description: Authentication and federation application supporting several protocols
 simpleSAMLphp, with its support for several authentication mechanisms
 and federation protocols, can be used for local authentication, as a
 service provider or identity provider. It currently supports the
 following protocols:
 .

  * Shibboleth 1.3 as a Service or Identity Provider.
  * A-Select as a Service or Identity Provider
  * CAS for remote authentication

 .
 Further authentication providers can be added in form of modules. Other
 features are protocol bridging, eduGAIN compatibility, attribute mapping
