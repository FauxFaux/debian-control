Description: fast and simple algorithm for approximate string matching/retrieval
 SimString is a simple library for fast approximate string
 retrieval. Approximate string retrieval finds strings in a database
 whose similarity with a query string is no smaller than a
 threshold. Finding not only identical but similar strings, approximate
 string retrieval has various applications including spelling
 correction, flexible dictionary matching, duplicate detection, and
 record linkage.
 .
 It is implemented using C++ templates.
