Description: single-dispatch generic functions for Python
 PEP 443 proposed to expose a mechanism in the functools standard library
 module in Python 3.4 that provides a simple form of generic programming known
 as single-dispatch generic functions.
 .
 This library is a backport of this functionality to Python 2.6 - 3.3.
 .
 This is the Python 3 version of the library.
