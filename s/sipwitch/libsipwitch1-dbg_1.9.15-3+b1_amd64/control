Description: secure peer-to-peer SIP VoIP server - debug symbols
 GNU SIP Witch is a secure peer-to-peer VoIP server.  Calls can be made
 even behind NAT firewalls, and without needing a service provider.  SIP
 Witch can be used on the desktop to create bottom-up secure calling
 networks as a free software alternative to Skype.  SIP Witch can also
 be used as a stand-alone SIP-based office telephone server, or to
 create secure VoIP networks for an existing IP-PBX such as Asterisk,
 FreeSWITCH, or Yate.
 .
 This package contains the debugging symbols.
