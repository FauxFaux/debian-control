Description: SiriDB time series database server
 SiriDB is a scalable, robust and fast time series database. Build from the
 ground up SiriDB uses a mechanism to operate without a global index and allows
 server resources to be added on the fly. SiriDB's query language includes
 dynamic grouping of time series for easy analysis over large amounts of time
 series.
