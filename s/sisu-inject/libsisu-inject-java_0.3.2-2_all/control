Description: Dependency Injection container for Java
 Sisu is a modular JSR330-based container that supports classpath scanning,
 auto-binding, and dynamic auto-wiring. Sisu uses Google-Guice to perform
 dependency injection and provide the core JSR330 support, but removes the
 need to write explicit bindings in Guice modules.
