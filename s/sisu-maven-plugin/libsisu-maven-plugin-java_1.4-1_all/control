Description: Manage Sisu components and applications
 Sisu is a modular JSR330-based container that supports classpath scanning,
 auto-binding, and dynamic auto-wiring.
 .
 sisu-maven-plugin indexes the JSR-330 components to be made available
 to Maven. It creates an index in META-INF/sisu/javax.inject.Named enumerating
 the components. This means that no classpath scanning is required at runtime
 to find them, which keeps Maven's startup time fast.
