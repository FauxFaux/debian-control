Description: SiSU dependencies for use with SQLite database
 SiSU is a lightweight markup based document structuring, publishing and search
 framework for document collections.
 .
 This package enables SiSU to populate an SQLite database. This is done at an
 object/paragraph level, making granular searches of documents possible.
 .
 This relational database feature of SiSU is not required but provides
 interesting possibilities, including that of granular searches of documents
 for matching units of text, primarily paragraphs that can be displayed or
 identified by object citation number, from which an index of documents
 matched and each matched paragraph within them can be displayed.
