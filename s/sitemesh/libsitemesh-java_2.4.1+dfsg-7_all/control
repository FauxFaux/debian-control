Description: web-page layout and decoration framework
 SiteMesh is framework that aids in creating large sites consisting of
 many web pages and applications for which a consistent look/feel,
 navigation and layout scheme is required.

 SiteMesh is built with Java servlet, JSP and XML technologies. This
 makes it ideal for use with Java EE applications, however it can be
 integrated with server-side web architectures that are not Java
 based.
