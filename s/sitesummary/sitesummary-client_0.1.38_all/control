Description: Generate site summary of submitting hosts (client part)
 The sitesummary system makes it easier to keep track of a lot of
 machines, by allowing each machine to report their existence once a
 day to a central collector, and using this collector to make summary
 reports about the hosts.
 .
 This package is the client part, reporting in to the server after
 boot and once a day.
