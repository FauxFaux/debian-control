Description: chess program that plays many variants
 Sjeng is a chess program that plays normal chess and many variants
 like crazyhouse, bughouse, suicide (aka giveaway or anti-chess) and
 losers. It can also play variants which have the same rules as
 normal chess, but a different starting position. It uses the
 XBoard/WinBoard interface by Tim Mann, so it can be used with
 xboard or eboard. It is also capable of playing on internet chess
 servers.
