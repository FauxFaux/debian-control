Description: 3D diagrams for TeX from scene description language
 Sketch is a simple system for producing line drawings of
 three-dimensional objects and scenes. Sketch is intended to produce finely
 wrought, mathematically-based illustrations with no extraneous detail
 and be able to easily overlay TeX math and text. The input language is
 reminiscent of PSTricks, so will be easy to learn for current PSTricks
 users.  It generates either PSTricks or TikZ/PGF code as output.
 .
 Note that this package is not the interactive vector drawing program
 now known as skencil.
