Description: standard dictionary file for SKK in cdb format for faster access
 This package provides `SKK-JISYO.cdb', the standard dictionary file for
 SKK Japanese input systems, converted to constant database (cdb) for
 faster access.  Currently, this package contains the large size dictionary
 file `SKK-JISYO.L.cdb' as the standard dictionary file.
 .
 Since this dictionary is a cdb file, it requires cdb support for accessing.
 SKK dictionary servers dbskkd-cdb and skksearch can handle cdb-style
 dictionaries, but ddskk cannot in itself.
 .
 The original plain text version of this dictionary is provided by the
 skkdic package.  Other dictionary files, such as zipcode, personal names,
 small size, are provided by the skkdic-extra package.  To merge or edit
 dictionaries, install the skktools package.
