 Japanese input systems.  Currently, this package contains the large size
 dictionary file `SKK-JISYO.L' as the standard dictionary file.

 constant database (cdb) file of this dictionary.  Other dictionary files,
 such as zipcode, personal names, small size, are provided by the
 skkdic-extra package.

 To merge or edit dictionaries, install the skktools package.  To use
 dictionaries more conveniently, several SKK dictionary servers are
 available, such as dbskkd-cdb and skksearch.
