Description: SKK dictionary server handling multiple dictionaries
 skksearch is a dictionary server for SKK Japanese input systems.
 skksearch can deal with more than one dictionary and supports three
 types of dictionaries, that is, plain, Berkeley DB and cdb
 (DJB's constant database).
 .
 skksearch is compatible with skkserv on the protocol behavior.
 It is called from an internet super-server.
 .
 By default, this package uses the SKK dictionary cdb file
 `SKK-JISYO.cdb' that is provided by the skkdic-cdb package.  Also,
 you can use other dictionary files such as the skkdic-extra package.
