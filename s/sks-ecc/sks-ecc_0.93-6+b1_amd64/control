Description: Cryptographic tool based on ECC
 SKS is a public-key, command-line application for encryption/authentication,
 based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). His minimalist design points to
 a simple, light, fast, easy-to-use and multiplatform software. All these
 features are satisfied with this high quality cryptography kit that has
 the following elements:
 .
  * Public key module: elliptic curve over GF (2^191).
  * Symmetric-key module: AES 192-bits key, with CTR mode.
  * Hash (for signatures, HMAC and passwords): TIGER (192 bits).
  * PRNG module.
