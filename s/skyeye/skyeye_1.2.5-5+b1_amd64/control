Description: Embedded Hardware Simulation
 The goal of SkyEye is to provide an integrated simulation environment
 in Linux and Windows. SkyEye environment simulates typical Embedded
 Computer Systems (Now it supports a series ARM architecture based
 microprocessors and Blackfin DSP Processor). You can run some Embedded
 Operation System such as ARM Linux, uClinux, uc/OS-II (ucos-ii) etc.
 in SkyEye, and analyse or debug them at source level.
 Now the following hardwares can be simulated by SkyEye:
 .
  * CPU core: ARM7TDMI, ARM720T, StrongARM, XScale, Blackfin.
  * Application CPU: Atmel AT91X40/AT91RM9200, Cirrus Logic
    EP7312/EP9312/CS89712, Intel SA1100/SA1110, Intel PXA 25x/27x,
    Samsung 4510B/44B0/2410/2440 , Sharp LH7xxxx, NS9750, Philips LPC22xx,
    BF533.
  * Memory: RAM, ROM, Flash.
  * Peripheral: Timer, UART, NIC chip, LCD, TouchScreen, etc.
