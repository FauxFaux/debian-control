Description: S-Lang programming library - runtime version
 S-Lang is a C programmer's library that includes routines for the rapid
 development of sophisticated, user friendly, multi-platform applications.
 .
 This package contains only the shared library libslang.so.* and copyright
 information. It is only necessary for programs that use this library (such
 as jed and slrn). If you plan on doing development with S-Lang, you will
 need the companion -dev package as well.
