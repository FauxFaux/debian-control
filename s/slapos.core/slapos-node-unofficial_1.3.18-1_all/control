Description: Node-side to deploy applications with SlapOS (unofficial)
 SlapOS allows one to turn any application into SaaS (Software as a Service),
 PaaS (Platform as a Service) or IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) without
 loosing your freedom. SlapOS defines two types of servers: SlapOS server and
 SlapOS node.
 .
 This package contains libraries and tools to deploy a node. This package is
 highly experimental and must only be used by people familiar with SlapOS.
 .
 Slapformat prepares a SlapOS node before running slapgrid. It then generates
 a report and sends the information to the configured SlapOS master.
 .
 Slapgrid allows you to easily deploy instances of software based on buildout
 profiles.
