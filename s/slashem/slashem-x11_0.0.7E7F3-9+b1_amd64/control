Description: variant of Nethack (X11 window port)
 Super Lotsa Added Stuff Hack - Extended Magic (SLASH'EM)
 is a role-playing game where you control a single character. The
 interface and gameplay are similar in style to Rogue, ADOM, Angband
 and, of course, Nethack. You control the actions through the
 keyboard and view the world from an overhead perspective.
 .
 The problem: The Amulet of Yendor has been stolen. Not only
 that but it appears that the Wizard of Yendor (not a nice person),
 who took the amulet, is hiding in the Dungeons of Doom (not a
 friendly place).
 .
 This package provides the X11 window port of Slash'EM
