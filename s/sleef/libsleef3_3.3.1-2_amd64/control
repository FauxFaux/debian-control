Description: SLEEF Vectorized Math Library (libraries)
 SLEEF stands for SIMD Library for Evaluating Elementary Functions. It
 implements vectorized versions of all C99 real floating point math functions.
 It can utilize SIMD instructions of modern processors. SLEEF is designed to
 fully utilize SIMD computation by reducing the use of conditional branches
 and scatter/gather memory access.
 .
 The library contains subroutines for all C99 real FP math functions in double
 precision and single precision. SLEEF also includes subroutines for discrete
 Fourier transform(DFT).
 .
 This package ships the shared objects.
