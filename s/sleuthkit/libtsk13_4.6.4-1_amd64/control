Description: library for forensics analysis on volume and filesystem data
 The Sleuth Kit, also known as TSK, is a collection of UNIX-based command
 line file and volume system forensic analysis tools. The filesystem tools
 allow you to examine filesystems of a suspect computer in a non-intrusive
 fashion. Because the tools do not rely on the operating system to process the
 filesystems, deleted and hidden content is shown.
 .
 The volume system (media management) tools allow you to examine the layout of
 disks and other media. You can also recover deleted files, get information
 stored in slack spaces, examine filesystems journal, see partitions layout on
 disks or images etc. But is very important clarify that the TSK acts over the
 current filesystem only.
 .
 The Sleuth Kit supports DOS partitions, BSD partitions (disk labels), Mac
 partitions, Sun slices (Volume Table of Contents), and GPT disks. With these
 tools, you can identify where partitions are located and extract them so that
 they can be analyzed with filesystem analysis tools.
 .
 Currently, TSK supports several filesystems, as NTFS, FAT, exFAT, HFS+, Ext3,
 Ext4, UFS and YAFFS2.
 .
 This package contains the library which can be used to implement all of the
 functionality of the command line tools into an application that needs to
 analyze data from a disk image.
