Description: GNU Scientific Library binding for S-Lang
 The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a vast collection of robust and
 well documented numerical functions. It includes support for many
 special functions, random numbers, interpolation and integration
 routines, and much more.
 .
 Many of the routines in the GSL may be made available to the S-Lang
 interpreter via the GSL modules included in this package.
 .
 The following GSL modules are available:
 .
  * gslsf: The GSL special function module. Currently, this module
    provides an interface to nearly 200 GSL special functions.
  * gslconst: The GSL constants module. This module defines many
    constants such as CONST_MKSA_SPEED_OF_LIGHT, CONST_CGSM_BOLTZMANN,
    etc.
  * gslinterp: The GSL interpolation module, which includes routines
    for linear interpolation, cubic splines, etc.
  * gslrand: The GSL random number module.  This module supports most
    of GSL's random number generators and distributions.
  * gslcdf: The GSL cumulative distribution function module.
  * gslfft: The GSL fast-fourier transform module.
  * gslcore: This is a module that must be loaded before any of the
    above modules can be loaded.  Its main purpose is to provide support
    functions for the other GSL modules.
