Description: Slimbox is a visual clone of the popular Lightbox
 Slimbox is a 4 KB visual clone of the popular Lightbox 2 script by Lokesh
 Dhakar, written using the jQuery javascript library (in version 2) or the
 MooTools javascript framework (in version 1). It was designed to be very small,
 efficient, standards-friendly, fully customizable, more convenient and 100%
 compatible with the original Lightbox 2.
 .
 Although the design and base functionalities are the same as Lightbox, the code
 was written from scratch and is constantly improved.
