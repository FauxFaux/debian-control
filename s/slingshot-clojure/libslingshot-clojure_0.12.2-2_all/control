Description: Enhanced throw and catch library for Clojure
 Slingshot is a Clojure library providing enhanced throw and catch replacements
 try+ and throw+.
 .
 Each is 100% compatible with Clojure's and Java's native try and throw both in
 source code and at runtime. Each also provides new capabilities intended to
 improve ease of use by leveraging Clojure's features like maps, records, and
 destructuring. Among them:
 .
    * throw+ can throw any Java object, not just those whose class is derived
      from java.lang.Throwable (e.g. Clojure maps or records)
 .
    * catch clauses within try+ can catch any Java object thrown by throw+,
      Clojure's throw, or Java's throw
 .
    * selectors in catch clauses allow matching on class name, key-value
      vectors, predicates and more
 .
    * Information about the context of a throw site is accessible via a hidden
      argument that includes information on, for example, the caught object,
      exception messages and stack traces
