Description: SLIP/PPP emulator using a dial up shell account
 Slirp is a TCP/IP emulator which turns an ordinary shell account
 into a (C)SLIP/PPP account.  This allows shell users to use all the
 funky Internet applications like Netscape, Mosaic, CUSeeMe, etc.
 .
 Please note that maybe your ISP really doesn't like you using slirp,
 because they want to charge more for a ppp connection, so use it at
 your own risk.
