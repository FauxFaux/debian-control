Description: Threadless, event-based XMPP Python library (documentation)
 Slixmpp is a (friendly) fork of SleekXMPP, which goal is to “improve” the
 core of the library by entirely removing all threads from the library and
 using an event-based approach instead.
 .
 This is the documentation package.
