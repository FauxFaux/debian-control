Description: Threadless, event-based XMPP Python 3 library (optional binary module)
 Slixmpp is a (friendly) fork of SleekXMPP, which goal is to “improve” the
 core of the library by entirely removing all threads from the library and
 using an event-based approach instead.
 .
 This is an optional package that installs a binary extension module to
 improve performance on critical modules.
