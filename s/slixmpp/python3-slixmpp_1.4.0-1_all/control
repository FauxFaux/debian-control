Description: Threadless, event-based XMPP Python 3 library
 Slixmpp is a (friendly) fork of SleekXMPP, which goal is to “improve” the
 core of the library by entirely removing all threads from the library and
 using an event-based approach instead.
 .
 Features of this library:
  * No threads. See http://blog.louiz.org/slixmpp. All parts of the API relying
    on threads are removed.
  * No support for Python < 3.4. This allows one to remove a lot of workaround
    and other hacks.
  * No backward compatibility with old SleekXMPP version. For example things
    like “addHandler = add_handler” are removed.
 .
 You should use this library only if you would prefer not to use threads in
 your application. If threads don’t really bother you, or if you need Python
 2 support, then you should use SleekXMPP instead.
