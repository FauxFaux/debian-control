Description: replication system for PostgreSQL: daemon and administration tools
 Slony-I is an asynchronous master-to-multiple-slaves replication system
 for PostgreSQL with cascading and slave promotion.
 .
 This package contains the slon daemon and the slonik administration tool.
 It should be installed on those hosts where Slony-I daemons are to be run
 or administered, which usually, but not necessarily, are the hosts where
 the database server nodes are running.
