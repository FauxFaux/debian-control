Description: PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) interface for S-Lang
 PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine) is a software package which permits a
 heterogeneous collection computers connected by a network to be used
 as a single large parallel computer.
 .
 The S-Lang PVM module provides a S-Lang interface to PVM. By
 organizing distributed computations with S-Lang, one gains the
 advantages of programming in an interpreted language.
 .
 With this approach, one can make efficient use of all available
 computer resources: high level logic is handled in interpreted code,
 CPU intensive work is done in compiled code and PVM simplifies using
 all available CPUs.
