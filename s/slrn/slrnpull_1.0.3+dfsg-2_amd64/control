Description: pulls a small newsfeed from an NNTP server
 Slrnpull pulls a small newsfeed, from an NNTP server, to a local news spool
 directory. The news spool can be used by news readers (such as slrn), which
 can read a local news spool without an NNTP server.
 .
 In combination with the slrn news reader, slrnpull can provide true
 offline news reading. You can tell slrnpull to download headers only,
 mark interesting ones for download with slrn and fetch those article
 bodies during the next run of slrnpull.
 .
 Slrnpull also has the ability to killfile articles so that they will not
 be downloaded from the server.
