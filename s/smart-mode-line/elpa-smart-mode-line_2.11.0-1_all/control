Description: powerful and beautiful mode-line for Emacs
 Smart Mode Line is a sexy mode-line for Emacs. Its main features are:
 .
   * Highlights the most important information
   * Intelligently truncates path name and mode names
   * Allows right indentation of strings in the modeline
   * Shorthand directory names (e.g. ~/.emacs.d/ is translated to :ED:)
   * Hide or highlight minor-modes
   * Easy configuration of all colours and variables
   * Compatible with any other packages that write to the mode-line
 .
 If you have a small screen device such as a netbook, and have been
 looking for a way to maximise the vertical real estate available
 for editing, without losing the consistent location of the clock,
 then install this addon, run emacs full-screen, and discover
 how powerful the mode-line can be.  It can replace most of the
 functionality that a desktop panel provides!
