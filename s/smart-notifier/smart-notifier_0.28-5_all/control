Description: graphical hard disk health status notifier
 A graphical notifier for smartmontools which attempts to show messages from
 the smartd disk monitoring daemon to the user. Currently only for gtk.
 .
 WARNING: This package is not a replacement for regular backups. It will _try_
 to warn the user when smartd sends a disk health warning. But success is not
 guaranteed. At best this package is an extra layer of protection.
