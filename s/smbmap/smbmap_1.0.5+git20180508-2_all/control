Description: handy SMB enumeration tool
 SMBMap allows users to enumerate samba share drives across an entire domain.
 List share drives, drive permissions, share contents, upload/download
 functionality, file name auto-download pattern matching, and even execute
 remote commands. This tool was designed with pen testing in mind, and is
 intended to simplify searching for potentially sensitive data across large
 networks.
