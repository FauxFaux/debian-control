Description: SML library for parsing and type-checking C programs
 ckit is a C front end written in SML that translates C source code (after
 preprocessing) into abstract syntax represented as a set of SML datatypes.
 It also provides facilities for extending the C language with additional
 syntactic constructs, which can be useful for implementing "C-like"
 domain-specific languages as well as C dialects.
