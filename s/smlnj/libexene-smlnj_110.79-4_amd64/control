Description: Concurrent ML library for the X Window System
 A multi-threaded X Window System toolkit written in Concurrent
 ML. Many other windowing toolkits, such as Xlib, register separate
 functions that are called by a centralized event processing loop. In
 contrast, eXene maintains each window and graphical object in a
 separate thread that has the ability to update itself.
