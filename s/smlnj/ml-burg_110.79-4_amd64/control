Description: Code generator for Standard ML
 ml-burg generates a Standard ML program to perform bottom-up
 rewriting of an input tree.  Cost information associated with each
 rewrite rule is used to derive the minimum rewrite cost for the
 entire tree.  A successful reduction corresponds to rewriting the
 input tree to a special non-terminal symbol called the "start"
 non-terminal.  Upon successful reduction, facilities are provided to
 walk the tree emitting semantic actions corresponding to the rules
 that matched.
 .
 Install this package if you want to write a compiler in SML using a
 burg specification.
