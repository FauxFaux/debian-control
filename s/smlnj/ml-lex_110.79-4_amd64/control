Description: Lexical analyzer generator for Standard ML
 Lexical analysis is the problem of segmenting input into words and
 recognizing different classes of words.  ml-lex uses regular
 expressions to describe classes of words.  It transforms a simple
 declarative language specification into an efficient SML program for
 analyzing that language.
 .
 Install this package if you want to produce a lexer in Standard ML.
