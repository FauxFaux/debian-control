Description: ML generator for C glue code
 This tool reads in C source code and outputs ML code and a CM
 description file for use with the ML "No Longer Foreign Function
 Interface" library. This tool works by separating each top-level C
 declaration into a new ML source file. For large programs, this
 puts some strain on the SML Compilation Manager, but this should only
 marginally increase the program run-time.
