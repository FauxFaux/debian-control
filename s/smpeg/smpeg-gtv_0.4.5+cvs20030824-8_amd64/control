Description: SMPEG GTK+ MPEG audio/video player
 SMPEG (SDL MPEG Player Library) is a free MPEG1 video player library with
 sound support.  Video playback is based on the ubiquitous Berkeley MPEG
 player, mpeg_play v2.2.  Audio is played through a slightly modified
 mpegsound library, part of splay v0.8.2. SMPEG supports MPEG audio (MP3),
 MPEG-1 video, and MPEG system streams.
 .
 This package contains a GTK+ player called gtv.
