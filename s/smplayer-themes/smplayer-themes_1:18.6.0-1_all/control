Description: complete front-end for MPlayer - icon themes
 Qt Mplayer front-end, with basic features like playing videos, DVDs, and
 VCDs to more advanced features like support for MPlayer filters and more.
 One of the most interesting features of SMPlayer: it remembers the settings
 of all files you play.  So you start to watch a movie but you have to
 leave... don't worry, when you open that movie again it will resume at the
 same point you left it, and with the same settings: audio track, subtitles,
 volume...
 .
 This package contains additional icon themes.
