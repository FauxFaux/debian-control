Description: Snapcast client
 Snapcast is a multi-room client-server audio player, where all clients are
 time synchronized with the server to play perfectly synced audio. It's not a
 standalone player, but an extension that turns your existing audio player into
 a Sonos-like multi-room solution.
 .
 This package contains the client which connects to the server and plays the
 audio.
