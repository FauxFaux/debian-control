Description: GLib snapd library (development files)
 snapd-glib is a library to allow GLib based applications access to snapd,
 the daemon that controls Snaps.
 .
 Snaps are 'universal' packages that work across many different Linux
 systems, enabling secure distribution of the latest apps and utilities
 for cloud, servers, desktops and the internet of things.
 .
 This package contains header files and development information, which
 is useful for building applications that need to communicate with snapd.
