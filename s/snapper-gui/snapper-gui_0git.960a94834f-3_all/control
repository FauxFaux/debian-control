Description: graphical user interface for snapper
 Snapper-gui is a graphical user interface for the tool snapper
 for Linux filesystem snapshot management. It can compare snapshots
 and revert differences between snapshots. In simple terms, this
 allows root and non-root users to view older versions of files and
 revert changes
 .
 Currently works with btrfs, ext4 and thin-provisioned LVM volumes
