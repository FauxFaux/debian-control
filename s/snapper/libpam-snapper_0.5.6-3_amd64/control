Description: PAM module for Linux filesystem snapshot management tool
 Snapper is a tool for Linux filesystem snapshot management. Apart from the
 obvious creation and deletion of snapshots, it can compare snapshots and revert
 differences between snapshots. In simple terms, this allows root and non-root
 users to view older versions of files and revert changes.
 .
 This package contains the PAM library for snapper, which allows the
 administrator to take snapshots when an user logs in or out of the system.
