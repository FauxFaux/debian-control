Description: Snappy for Java, a fast compressor/decompresser (JNI library)
 Java port of Snappy, a fast compresser/decompresser written in C++,
 originally developed by Google.
 .
 Snappy's main target is very high-speed compression/decompression with
 reasonable compression size. So the compression ratio of snappy-java is
 modest and about the same as LZF (ranging 20%-100% according to the
 dataset).
 .
 This package contains the architecture specific Java native interface part.
