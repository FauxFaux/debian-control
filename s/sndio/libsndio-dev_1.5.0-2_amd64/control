Description: Small audio and MIDI framework from OpenBSD, development files
 Sndio is a small, simple audio and MIDI framework, developed by the OpenBSD
 project. It provides a lightweight audio and MIDI server and a well-documented
 userspace API to access the server or audio hardware in a uniform way. Sndio is
 designed to work well for both desktop and professional music applications, and
 supports features found in more complex sound systems such as per-application
 volume control, software mixing, and network transparency.
 .
 This package contains development files and documentation for the sndio
 userspace libraries.
