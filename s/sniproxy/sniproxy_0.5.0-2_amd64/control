Description: Transparent TLS and HTTP layer 4 proxy with SNI support
 Proxies incoming HTTP and TLS connections based on the hostname contained in
 the initial request of the TCP session. This enables HTTPS name-based virtual
 hosting to separate backend servers without installing the private key on the
 proxy machine.
