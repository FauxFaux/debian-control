Description: A curses-based utility that polls hosts to determine connectivity
 Simple network top (sntop) is a curses-based console utility,
 in the spirit of top, that polls network hosts at a regular interval to
 determine their connectivity and displays the results in a pretty format.
 Advanced features, such as automatic HTML generation of results,
 secure terminal mode, execution of external file on connectivity change,
 and user/system configure files, are supported.
