Description: short-read assembly method to build de novo draft assembly
 SOAPdenovo is a novel short-read assembly method that can build a de novo draft
 assembly for the human-sized genomes. The program is specially designed to
 assemble Illumina GA short reads.
 .
 It creates new opportunities for building reference
 sequences and carrying out accurate analyses of unexplored genomes in a cost
 effective way.
