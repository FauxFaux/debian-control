Description: UHD device support for SoapySDR (default version)
 Both SoapySDR and the Universal Hardware Driver by Ettus Research projects
 provide libraries to access various software defined radio hardware through a
 common interface.
 .
 This SoapySDR hardware support module makes all UHD devices available to
 applications using SoapySDR. An interface in the other direction is available
 in the uhd-soapysdr package.
 .
 This is an empty dependency package that pulls in the UHD module for the
 default version of libsoapysdr.
