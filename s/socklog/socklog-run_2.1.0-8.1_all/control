Description: system and kernel logging services
 socklog cooperates with the runit package to create a small and secure
 replacement for syslogd.  socklog supports system logging through Unix
 domain sockets (/dev/log), UDP sockets (0.0.0.0:514), as well as TCP
 socket, with the help of runit's runsvdir, runsv, and svlogd.  socklog
 provides a different network logging concept, and also does log event
 notification.  svlogd has built in log file rotation based on file size,
 so there is no need for any cron jobs to rotate the logs.  socklog is
 small, secure, and reliable.
 .
 This package sets up the socklog-unix and socklog-klog services to
 provide a system log service and kernel log service respectively.
