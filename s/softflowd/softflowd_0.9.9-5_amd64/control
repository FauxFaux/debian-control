Description: Flow-based network traffic analyser
 Softflowd is a flow-based network traffic anaylser capable of Cisco
 Netflow data export. Softflowd semi-statefully tracks traffic
 flows recorded by listening on a network interface or by reading a
 packet capture file. These flows may be reported via NetFlow to a
 collecting host or summarised within softflowd itself.
