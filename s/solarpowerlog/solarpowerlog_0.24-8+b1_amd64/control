 collect power data and store them. Also a purpose is to provide an interface
 to extract these data, allowing applications like web site stats of the system.
 .
 Solarpowerlog supports at the moment Solarmax inverters, connected via ethernet
 or serial interface, however it is programmed in a way to easy add support for
 other inverters as well.
