Description: library for safe floating-point code development -- lib
 Sollya is both a tool environment and a library for safe floating-point code
 development. It offers a convenient way to perform computations with multiple
 precision interval arithmetic. It is particularly targeted to the automated
 implementation of mathematical floating-point libraries.
 .
 Initially, Sollya was intended more specifically for people implementing
 numerical functions in mathematical libraries (e.g., exp, arccos, tanh, etc.).
 Since then, the tool has evolved and has now become interesting not only to
 developers of mathematical libraries, but also to everyone who needs to
 perform numerical experiments in an environment that is safe with respect to
 round-off errors.
 .
 This package provides the dynamic library.
