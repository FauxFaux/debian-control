Description: arranges water molecules around protein structures
 For molecular dynamics simulations it is sometimes appropriate
 not to model in the vacuum but to have the proteins surrounded
 by their solvent. This program computes the location of water
 molecules such that the resulting PDB files become suitable
 for further analyses.
