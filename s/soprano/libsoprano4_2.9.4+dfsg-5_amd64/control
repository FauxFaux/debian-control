Description: libraries for the Soprano RDF framework
 Soprano is a pluggable RDF storage, parsing, and serialization framework based
 on Qt 4.  Soprano is targeted at desktop applications that need to store RDF
 data.  Its API has been optimized for simplicity and ease of use, while its
 modular structure allows it to use various different RDF storage
 implementations as its backend.
 .
 This package contains the Soprano core libraries, D-Bus service, parser
 plugins, and a storage plugin for the Redland RDF Application Framework.
