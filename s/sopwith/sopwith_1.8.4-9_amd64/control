Description: port of the 1980's side-scrolling WWI dogfighting game
 This is an updated version of the 1980's game developed by David L. Clark of
 BMB Compuscience Canada.  It has been adapted to run under *nix using the SDL
 toolkit. Poor graphics, stupid AI, and horrible sound await you. The gameplay
 is simple, addictive, and fun. A `side-scroller', you pilot your biplane
 across a static field, destroying enemy encampments and planes.
