Description: Qt5 GUI component toolkit for Inventor - development
 SoQt is a Qt GUI component toolkit library for Coin, based on the
 API of the InventorXt GUI component toolkit.  SoQt is also compatible
 with OpenInventor of SGI and TGS.
 .
 SoQt provides a class-hierarchy of viewer classes that ranges from a
 simple render canvas (the SoQtRenderArea), providing only the basic
 synchronization and device input conversion routines between Qt and
 Coin, up to 3 different full-featured viewer classes
 (SoQtExaminerViewer, SoQtPlaneViewer and SoQtFlyViewer) with input
 device handling logic and user interfaces to let the application
 programmer do Rapid Application Development.
 .
 This library is linked against Qt version 5.
