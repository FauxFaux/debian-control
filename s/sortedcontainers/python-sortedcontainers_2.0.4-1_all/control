Description: sorted container types: SortedList, SortedDict, and SortedSet
 Python’s standard library is great until you need a sorted container type. Many
 will attest that you can get really far without one, but the moment you really
 need a sorted list, dict, or set, you’re faced with a dozen different
 implementations, most using C-extensions without great documentation and
 benchmarking.
