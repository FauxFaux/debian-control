Description: Stretches and pitch-shifts sound independently
 This program can stretch and pitch-shift .wav-files independently.
 This is especially useful for musicians, who want to listen to a song
 played slowly, without having the pitch altered.
 .
 This program uses the SoundTouch shared library for the actual work.
