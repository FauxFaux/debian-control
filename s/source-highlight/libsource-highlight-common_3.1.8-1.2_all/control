Description: architecture-independent files for source highlighting library
 This package contains the data files used by the libsource-highlight
 library, which is the library that underlies the source-highlight
 program suite.  The library converts source code to a document with
 syntax highlighting and supports many file formats.  The library can
 be used by other C++ programs to get source code highlighting
 capabilities.
