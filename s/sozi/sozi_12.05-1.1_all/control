Description: inkscape extension for creating animated presentations
 Unlike most presentation formats, a Sozi document is not organized as
 a slideshow, but rather as a poster where the content of your
 presentation can be freely laid out. Playing such a presentation
 consists in a series of translations, zooms and rotations that focus
 on the elements you want to show.
 .
 A Sozi presentation is an SVG document in which a sequence of “frames”
 is defined. A frame is a rectangular region of the document associated
 with presentation and animation information (e.g. title, ordering,
 transition duration).
 .
 The presentation editor is an extension for the Inkscape vector
 graphics editor. It means that you can create an entire presentation,
 graphics and animation, within a single environment.
 .
 Documents produced by Inkscape and Sozi can be displayed and animated
 by web browsers supporting the SVG format, and the Javascript
 language. The user can control the presentation using the mouse and
 keyboard.
