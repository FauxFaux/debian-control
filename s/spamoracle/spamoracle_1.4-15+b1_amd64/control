Description: statistical analysis spam filter based on Bayes' formula
 SpamOracle, a.k.a. "Saint Peter", is a tool to help detect and filter away
 "spam" (unsolicited commercial e-mail). It proceeds by statistical analysis
 of the words that appear in the e-mail, comparing the frequencies of words
 with those found in a user-provided corpus of known spam and known legitimate
 e-mail. The classification algorithm is based on Bayes' formula, and is
 described in Paul Graham's paper, A plan for spam.
 .
 This program is designed to work in conjunction with procmail. The result of
 the analysis is output as an additional message header X-Spam:, followed by
 yes, no or unknown, plus additional details. A procmail rule can then test
 this X-Spam: header and deliver the e-mail to the appropriate mailbox.
