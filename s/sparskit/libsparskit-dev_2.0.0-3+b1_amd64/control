Description: basic tool-kit for sparse matrix computations - devel
 SPARSKIT a basic tool-kit for sparse matrix computations. Sparskit is a general
 purpose FORTRAN-77  library for sparse matrix computations. It has been
 gathered over several years and includes some of the most useful tools for
 developing and implementing sparse matrix techniques, particularly for
 iterative solvers. If you need a simple routine for doing a sparse matrix
 operation (e.g., adding two sparse matrices, or reordering a sparse matrix) it
 is likely to be available in SPARSKIT. SPARSKIT also contains most of the
 iterative accelarators and a number of efficient preconditioners.
