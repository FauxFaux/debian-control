Description: basic tool-kit for sparse matrix computations - runtime
 SPARSKIT a basic tool-kit for sparse matrix computations. Sparskit is a
 general purpose FORTRAN-77 library for sparse matrix computations. It has
 been gathered over several years and includes some of the most useful tools
 for developing and implementing sparse matrix techniques, particularly for
 iterative solvers. If you need a simple routine for doing a sparse matrix
 operation (e.g., adding two sparse matrices, or reordering a sparse matrix)
 it is likely to be available in SPARSKIT. SPARSKIT also contains most of
 the iterative accelarators and a number of efficient preconditioners.
