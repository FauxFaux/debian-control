Description: FastCGI process spawner
 Allows FastCGI processes to be separated from web server process :
   * Easy creation of chmoded socket.
   * Privilege separation without needing a suid-binary,
     or running a server as root.
   * You can restart your web server and the FastCGI applications
     without restarting the others.
   * You can run them in different chroot()s.
   * Running your FastCGI applications doesn’t depend on the web server
     you are running, which allows for easier testing of/migration
     to other web servers.
