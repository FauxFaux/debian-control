Description: Synchrotron image corrections and azimuthal integration
 SPD stands for SPatial Distortion. Written in C language, this command-line
 driven program deals with images coming from X-ray diffusion/diffraction
 experiments. It does subsequently:
  *intensity corrections (dark current, flat field correction, ...),
  *geometry corrections using spline files or a pair of distortion arrays,
  *azimuthal integration in 2D or 1D after maskin defective pixels.
 SPD was originally written by Jorg Klora for ESRF and was re-written by Peter
 Boesecke. Maintenance and packaging of the program are provided by Rainer
 Wilcke and Jerome Kieffer from software group at ESRF.
