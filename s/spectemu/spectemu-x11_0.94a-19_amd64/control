Description: Fast 48k ZX Spectrum Emulator for X11
 xspect is the X11 version of Spectemu which emulates the 48k ZX
 Spectrum, which uses the Z80 microprocessor.
 .
 It emulates the Z80 processor as well as the 48k Spectrum's other
 hardware: keyboard, screen, sound, tape I/O. The emulation is very
 close to the real thing, but it is still quite fast (It was reported
 to be working well on a laptop with 486 at 25MHz!). On the other hand,
 the user interface is not the best.
 .
 Features include:
    - Sound support through Linux kernel sound-card driver.
    - Snapshot saving and loading (.Z80 and .SNA format)
    - Tape emulation: loading from tape files (.TAP and .TZX format)
    - Optional quick loading of tapes.
    - Saving to tape files.
    - Separate utility to save tape files to real tape
    - Configurable with config files and from command line
