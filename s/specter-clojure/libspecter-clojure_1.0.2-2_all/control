Description: data structure transformation library for Clojure
 Most of Clojure programming involves creating, manipulating, and transforming
 immutable values. However, as soon as your values become more complicated than
 a simple map or list – like a list of maps of maps – transforming these data
 structures becomes extremely cumbersome.
 .
 Specter is a library (for both Clojure and ClojureScript) for doing these
 queries and transformations extremely concisely and elegantly. These kinds of
 manipulations are so common when using Clojure – and so cumbersome without
 Specter – that Specter is in many ways Clojure's missing piece.
