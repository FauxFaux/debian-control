Description: Utilities to spell-check selectively
 Spellutils is a suite of programs which are used to isolate some
 parts from various types of files and hand them over to another
 program which may change the texts; it is typically a spell checker.
 Afterwards the possibly changed text parts are copied back in place
 in the original file.
 .
 The newsbody program is intended for use on mail and news messages;
 it can e.g. ignore headers, quoted material and signatures.
 .
 The pospell program is for use on translated strings in .po files.
