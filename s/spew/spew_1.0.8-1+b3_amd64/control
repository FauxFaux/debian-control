Description: I/O performance measurement and load generation tool
 Spew is used to measure I/O performance of character devices, block
 devices, and regular files. It can also be used to generate high I/O loads
 to stress systems while verifying data integrity.

 Spew is easy to use and is flexible. No configuration files or
 complicated client/server configurations are needed. Spew also generates
 its own data patterns that are designed to make it easy to find and debug
 data integrity problems.
