Description: Shared Persistent Heap Data Environment library
 SPHDE is composed of two major software layers: The Shared Address Space (SAS)
 layer provides the basic services for a shared address space and transparent,
 persistent storage. The Shared Persistent Heap (SPH) layer organizes blocks of
 SAS storage into useful functions for storing and retrieving data.
 .
 This package contains the runtime shared library.
