Description: Development files for Spherepack scientific library
 SPHEREPACK is a collection of FORTRAN programs that facilitates computer
 modeling of geophysical processes. The package contains programs for computing
 certain common differential operators including divergence, vorticity,
 gradients, and the Laplacian of both scalar and vector functions. Programs are
 also available for inverting these operators. For example, given divergence
 and vorticity, the package can be used to compute the velocity components.
 The Laplacian can also be inverted and therefore the package can be used
 to solve both the scalar and vector Poisson equations. Its use in model
 development is demonstrated by a sample program that solves the time-dependent
 non-linear shallow-water equations. Accurate solutions are obtained via the
 spectral method that uses both scalar and vector spherical harmonic transforms
 that are available to the user. The package also contains utility programs
 for computing the associated Legendre functions, Gauss points and weights,
 and multiple fast Fourier transforms. Programs are provided for both
 equally-spaced and Gauss distributed latitudinal points as well as programs
 that transfer data between these grids.
