Description: extension to build reST (reStructuredText) files with Sphinx (Python 3)
 This extension is in particular useful to use in combination with the autodoc
 extension. In this combination, autodoc generates the documentation based on
 docstrings, and restbuilder outputs the result are reStructuredText (.rst)
 files.
 .
 In order to use it, add sphinxcontrib.restbuilder into the extensions list of
 your Sphinx configuration file (conf.py)
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version.
