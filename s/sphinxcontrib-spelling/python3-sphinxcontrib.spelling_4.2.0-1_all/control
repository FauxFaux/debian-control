Description: Sphinx "spelling" extension (Python 3)
 This package contains the spelling extension for the Sphinx documentation
 system.
 The extension enables a spelling checker which uses PyEnchant to produce a
 report showing misspelled words.
 .
 The extension also:
  - Supports multiple source languages using the standard enchant
    dictionaries.
  - Supports project-specific dictionaries for localized jargon and other
    terminology that may not appear in the global dictionaries.
  - Suggests alternatives to words not found in the dictionary, when
    possible.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the extension.
