Description: website engine for publishing
 SPIP is a publishing system for the Internet in which great importance
 is attached to collaborative working, to multilingual environments,
 and to simplicity of use for web authors.
 .
 SPIP's benefit consists in:
 .
  * managing a magazine type site i.e. made up mainly of
    articles and news items inserted in an arborescence
    of sections nested in each others.
  * completely separating and distributing three kinds of tasks
    over various players: the graphic design, the site editorial
    input through the submission of articles and news items and
    the site editorial management.
  * spare the webmaster and all the participants to the life of
    the site, a number of tedious aspects of web publishing as
    well as the need to learn lengthy technical skills.
    SPIP allows you to start creating your sections and
    articles straight away.
