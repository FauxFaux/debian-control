Description: Driver for Samsung and Xerox SPL2 and SPLc laser printers
 Support for printing to SPL2- and SPLc-based printers. These are most
 of the cheaper Samsung laser printers which do not understand standard
 languages like PostScript or PCL. Both monochrome (ML-15xx, ML-16xx,
 ML-17xx, ML-2xxx) and color (CLP-5xx, CLP-6xx) models are supported.
 Also some rebranded Samsungs like the Xerox Phaser 6100 work with this
 driver.
 .
 Note that older SPL1-based models (ML-12xx, ML-14xx) do not work. Use
 these printers with the older "gdi" driver which is built into
 GhostScript.
