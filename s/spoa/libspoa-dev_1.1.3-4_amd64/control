Description: SIMD partial order alignment library (development files)
 Spoa (SIMD POA) is a c++ implementation of the partial order alignment
 (POA) algorithm (as described in 10.1093/bioinformatics/18.3.452) which
 is used to generate consensus sequences (as described in
 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg109). It supports three alignment modes: local
 (Smith-Waterman), global (Needleman-Wunsch) and semi-global alignment
 (overlap).
 .
 This package contains the static library and the header files.
