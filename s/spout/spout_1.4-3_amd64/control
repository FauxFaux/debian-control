Description: Tiny abstract black and white 2D cave-shooter
 This is a small, abstract shooting game from Japanese developer Kuni. It is a
 'caveflier' in which the exhaust from the engine also serves as a tool to
 erode the cave walls.
 .
 Your goal is to fly upwards as long as you possibly can, without crashing
 against the cave walls and the window borders.
