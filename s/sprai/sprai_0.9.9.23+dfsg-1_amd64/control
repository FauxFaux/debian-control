Description: single-pass sequencing read accuracy improver
 Sprai is a tool to correct sequencing errors in single-pass reads for
 de novo assembly. It is originally designed for correcting sequencing
 errors in single-molecule DNA sequencing reads, especially in Continuous
 Long Reads (CLRs) generated by PacBio RS sequencers. The goal of Sprai is
 not maximizing the accuracy of error-corrected reads. Instead, Sprai aims
 at maximizing the continuity (i.e., N50 contig length) of assembled contigs
 after error correction.
