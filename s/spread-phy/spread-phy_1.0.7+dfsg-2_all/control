Description: analyze and visualize phylogeographic reconstructions
 SPREAD is a user-friendly application to analyze and visualize
 phylogeographic reconstructions resulting from Bayesian inference of
 spatio-temporal diffusion.
 .
 There is a tutorial for SPREAD online at
 http://www.kuleuven.be/aidslab/phylogeography/tutorial/spread_tutorial.html
 .
 Originally this program is named "spread".  However, there is just such a
 package inside Debian and thus a 'phy' for phylogeny was prepended.
