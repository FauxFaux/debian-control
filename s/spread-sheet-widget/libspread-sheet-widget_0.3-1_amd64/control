Description: shared library for GTK+ to view and manipulate two dimensional tabular data
 GNU Spread Sheet Widget is a library for Gtk+ which provides a widget
 for viewing and manipulating 2 dimensional tabular data in a manner
 similar to many popular spread sheet programs.
 .
 The design follows the model-view-controller paradigm and is
 of complexity O(1) in both time and space. This means that
 it is efficient and fast even for very large data.
 .
 Features commonly found in graphical user interfaces such as
 cut and paste, drag and drop and row/column labelling are also included.
