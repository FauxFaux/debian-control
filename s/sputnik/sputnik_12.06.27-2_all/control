Description: Extensible wiki
 Sputnik is a wiki written in Lua. It is also a platform for building a range
 of wiki-like applications, drawing on Lua's strengths as an extension
 language.
 .
 Out of the box Sputnik behaves like a wiki with all the standard wiki
 features: editable pages, protection against spam bots, history view of pages,
 diff, preview, per-page-RSS feed for site changes.
 .
 At the same time, Sputnik is designed to be used as a platform for a wide
 range of "social software" applications. Sputnik stores its data as versioned
 "pages" that can be editable through the web, and it allows those pages to
 store any data that can be saved as text (prose, comma-separated values, lists
 of named parameters, Lua tables, mbox-formatted messages, XML, etc.) While by
 default the page is displayed as if it carried Markdown-formatted text, the
 way the page is viewed (or edited, or saved, etc.) can be overridden on a
 per-page basis by over-riding or adding "actions".
 .
 The packages provide a wide range of storage modules that may require
 one of the suggested packages: git, lua5.1-sql-sqlite3, lua5.1-sql-mysql.
 .
 The easiest form of deployment is by using the Xavante web server.
