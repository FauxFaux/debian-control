Description: memory profiling plugin for the Spyder IDE
 This is a plugin for the Spyder IDE that integrates the Python memory
 profiler. It allows you to see the memory usage in every line.
 .
 Add a `@profile` decorator to the functions that you wish to profile then
 press Ctrl+Shift+F10 to run the profiler on the current script, or go to
 `Run > Profile memory line by line`.
 .
 The results will be shown in a dockwidget, grouped by function. Lines with a
 stronger color have the largest increments in memory usage.
