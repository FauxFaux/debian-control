Description: common files for spyder
 Originally written to design Spyder (the Scientific PYthon
 Development EnviRonment), the spyderlib Python library provides
 ready-to-use pure-Python widgets: source code editor with syntax
 highlighting and code introspection/analysis features, NumPy array
 editor, dictionary editor, Python console, etc. It's based on the Qt
 Python binding module PyQt4 (and is compatible with PySide since
 v2.2).
 .
 This package provides the common files.
