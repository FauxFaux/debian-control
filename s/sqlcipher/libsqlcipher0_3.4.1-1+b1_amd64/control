Description: SQLCipher shared library
 SQLCipher is a C library that implements an encryption in the SQLite 3
 database engine.  Programs that link with the SQLCipher library can have SQL
 database access without running a separate RDBMS process.  It allows one to
 have per-database or page-by-page encryption using AES-256 from OpenSSL.
 .
 SQLCipher has a small footprint and great performance so itâ€™s ideal for
 protecting embedded application databases and is well suited for mobile
 development.
 .
  * as little as 5-15% overhead for encryption
  * 100% of data in the database file is encrypted
  * Uses good security practices (CBC mode, key derivation)
  * Zero-configuration and application level cryptography
  * Algorithms provided by the peer reviewed OpenSSL crypto library.
 .
 SQLCipher has broad platform support for with C/C++, Obj-C, QT,
 Win32/.NET/Mono, Java, Python, Ruby, Linux, Mac OS X, iPhone/iOS, Android,
 Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android.
 .
 SQLCipher v3.4.1 is based on SQLite3 v3.15.2.
