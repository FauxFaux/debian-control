 SQLite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine.
 Programs that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database
 access without running a separate RDBMS process.

 SQLite use SQLite version 3. See the "sqlite3-doc" package for that.
 .
 This package contains the documentation that is also available on
 the SQLite homepage.
