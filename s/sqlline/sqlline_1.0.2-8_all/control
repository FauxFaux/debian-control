Description: JDBC command-line utility for issuing SQL
 SQLLine is a pure-Java console based utility for connecting to
 relational databases and executing SQL commands.
 .
 It is similar to other command-line database access utilities like
 sqlplus for Oracle, mysql for MySQL, and isql for Sybase/SQL Server.
 .
 Since it is pure-Java, it is platform independent, and will run on
 any platform that can run Java 1.3 or higher.
