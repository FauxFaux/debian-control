Description: random SQL query generator
 SQLsmith is a random SQL query generator. Its paragon is Csmith, which proved
 valuable for quality assurance in C compilers.
 .
 It currently supports generating queries for PostgreSQL 9.5+ and sqlite3.
 .
 Besides PostgreSQL developers, users developing extensions of PostgreSQL might
 also be interested in exposing their code to SQLsmith's random workload.
 .
 During its prototyping stage, it already found about thirty bugs in
 PostgreSQL alphas, betas and releases, including security vulnerabilities in
 released versions.
