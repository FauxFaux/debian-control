Description: Squeak plugins for the Scratch programming environment
 Scratch is an easy, interactive, collaborative programming
 environment designed for creation of interactive stories, animations,
 games, music, and art -- and sharing these on the web.
 .
 Scratch is designed to help young people (ages 8 and up) develop 21st
 century learning skills. As they create Scratch projects, young people
 learn important mathematical and computational ideas, while also
 gaining a deeper understanding of the process of design.
 .
 This package contains the plugins needed by Scratch and its derivatives.
