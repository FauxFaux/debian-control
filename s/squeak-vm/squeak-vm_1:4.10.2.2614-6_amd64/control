Description: virtual machine for Smalltalk
 Squeak is a full-featured implementation of the Smalltalk programming
 language and environment based on (and largely compatible with) the
 original Smalltalk-80 system.
 .
 This package contains just the Unix Squeak virtual machine.  You will
 likely need also an image file containing a "snapshot" of a live Squeak
 session - e.g. one of the Debian packages etoys or scratch.
