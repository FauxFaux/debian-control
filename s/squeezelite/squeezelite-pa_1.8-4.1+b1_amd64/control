Description: lightweight headless Squeezebox emulator - PortAudio version
 Squeezelite is a small headless Squeezebox emulator. It is aimed at
 supporting high quality audio including USB DAC based output at multiple
 sample rates.
 .
 It supports decoding PCM (WAV/AIFF), FLAC, MP3, Ogg, AAC, WMA and ALAC
 audio formats. It can also resample audio, which allows squeezelite to
 upsample the output to the highest sample rate supported by the output
 device.
 .
 This package is built with the resampling, ffmpeg and visualisation export
 options. It uses PortAudio for audio output.
