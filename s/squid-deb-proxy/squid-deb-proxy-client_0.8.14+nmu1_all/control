Description: automatic proxy discovery for APT based on Avahi
 This package contains a helper for the APT http method to discover
 proxies that publish their service as _apt_proxy._tcp.
 .
 It was written to be installed on clients that should use
 squid-deb-proxy automatically, but it will work with any proxy
 that publishes the service as _apt_proxy._tcp.
