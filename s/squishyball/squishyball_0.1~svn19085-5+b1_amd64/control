Description: audio sample comparison testing tool
 squishyball is a simple command-line utility for performing
 double-blind A/B, A/B/X or X/X/Y (A/B/X with additional sample order
 randomisation) testing of audio samples on the command line.
 .
 The user specifies two input files to be compared and uses the
 keyboard during playback to flip between the randomized samples to
 perform on-the-fly comparisons.  After a predetermined number of
 trials, squishyball prints the trial results to stdout and exits.
 .
 squishyball can be used to help establish what lossy audio codec
 settings are optimal for a particular combination of user and
 audio equipment.
