Description: collection of powerful tools for manipulating EPROM load files
 The srecord package is a collection of powerful tools for manipulating EPROM
 load files. It reads and writes numerous EPROM file formats, and can perform
 many different manipulations.
 .
 The tools include:
  * The srec_cat program may be used to catenate (join) EPROM load files, or
    portions of EPROM load files, together. Because it understands all of the
    input and output formats, it can also be used to convert files from one
    format to another. It also understands filters.
  * The srec_cmp program may be used to compare EPROM load files, or portions
    of EPROM load files, for equality.
  * The srec_info program may be used to print summary information about EPROM
    load files.
