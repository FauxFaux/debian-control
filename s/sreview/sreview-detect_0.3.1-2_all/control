Description: SReview input detection script
 SReview is a video review and transcoding system. It allows users to
 review videos, and will then (after the review has finished) transcode
 them into archive-quality video files.
 .
 This package contains the sreview-detect script, which probes files in
 the input directory and either adds them to the database if they're
 new, or just updates their length if they're already known.
