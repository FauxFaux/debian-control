Description: SReview encoder code
 SReview is a video review and transcoding system. It allows users to
 review videos, and will then (after the review has finished) transcode
 them into archive-quality video files.
 .
 This package contains the encoder scripts that do all the hard work.
 It should be installed on the machines which will do the actual
 transcoding.
