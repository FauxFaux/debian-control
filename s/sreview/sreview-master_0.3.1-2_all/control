Description: SReview components for master host
 SReview is a video review and transcoding system. It allows users to
 review videos, and will then (after the review has finished) transcode
 them into archive-quality video files.
 .
 This package contains the components that should run on just one
 server. It is not useful without one or more machines also running the
 webinterface (in the sreview-web package) or the encoder (in the
 sreview-encoder package).
