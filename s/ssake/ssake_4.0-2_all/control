Description: genomics application for assembling millions of very short DNA sequences
 The Short Sequence Assembly by K-mer search and 3′ read Extension
 (SSAKE) is a genomics application for aggressively assembling
 millions of short nucleotide sequences by progressively searching for
 perfect 3′-most k-mers using a DNA prefix tree. SSAKE is designed to
 help leverage the information from short sequences reads by
 stringently clustering them into contigs that can be used to
 characterize novel sequencing targets.
