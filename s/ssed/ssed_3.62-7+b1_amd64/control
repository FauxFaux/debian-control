Description: The super sed stream editor
 Super sed reads the specified files or the standard input if no files are
 specified, makes editing changes according to a list of commands, and
 writes the results to the standard output.
 .
 Super sed is an enhanced version of GNU sed 3.02. Relative to 3.02, there
 are several new features (including in-place editing of files, extended
 regular expression syntax and a few new commands) and some bug fixes.
