Description: Transparent proxy server for VPN over SSH
 Sshuttle makes it possible to access remote networks using SSH. It creates a
 transparent proxy server, using iptables, that will forward all the traffic
 through an SSH tunnel to a remote copy of sshuttle.
 .
 It does not require installation on the remote server, which just needs to
 have Python installed.
