Description: Applicative protocol multiplexer
 sslh lets one accept HTTPS, SSH, OpenVPN, tinc and XMPP connections on the
 same port. This makes it possible to connect to any of these servers on
 port 443 (e.g. from inside a corporate firewall, which almost never block
 port 443) while still serving HTTPS on that port.
