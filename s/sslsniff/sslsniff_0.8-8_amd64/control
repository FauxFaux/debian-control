Description: SSL/TLS man-in-the-middle attack tool
 sslsniff is designed to create man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks for
 SSL/TLS connections, and dynamically generates certs for the domains
 that are being accessed on the fly. The new certificates are constructed
 in a certificate chain that is signed by any certificate that is
 provided.
 sslsniff also supports other attacks like null-prefix or OCSP attacks to
 achieve silent interceptions of connections when possible.
