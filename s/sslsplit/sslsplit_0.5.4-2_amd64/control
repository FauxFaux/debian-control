Description: transparent and scalable SSL/TLS interception
 SSLsplit is a tool for man-in-the-middle attacks against SSL/TLS
 encrypted network connections. Connections are transparently
 intercepted through a network address translation engine and
 redirected to SSLsplit. SSLsplit terminates SSL/TLS and initiates a
 new SSL/TLS connection to the original destination address, while
 logging all data transmitted. SSLsplit is intended to be useful for
 network forensics and penetration testing.
