Description: macromolecular superposition library - runtime
 SSM is a macromolecular coordinate superposition library, written by
 Eugene Krissinel of the EBI.
 .
 The library implements the SSM algorithm of protein structure
 comparison in three dimensions, which includes an original procedure
 of matching graphs built on the protein's secondary-structure
 elements, followed by an iterative three-dimensional alignment of
 protein backbone Calpha atoms.
 .
 This package contains the shared library components needed for programs
 that have been compiled with the ssm library.
