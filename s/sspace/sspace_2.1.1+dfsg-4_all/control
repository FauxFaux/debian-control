Description: scaffolding pre-assembled contigs after extension
 SSAKE-based Scaffolding of Pre-Assembled Contigs after Extension (SSPACE)
 is a script able to extend and scaffold pre-assembled contigs using one or
 more mate pairs or paired-end libraries, or even a combination.
 .
 SSPACE is built based on SSAKE. Code of SSAKE is changed to be able to
 extend and scaffold pre-assembled contigs for multiple paired reads
 libraries.

 This is the free 'basic' version of SSPACE. The non-free 'standard' version is
 available directly from Baseclear.
