Description: small scale reflection extension for Coq (plugin)
 This package is part of Ssreflect, the small scale reflection
 extension for Coq. It provides a new tactic language, which promotes
 more structured, concise and robust proof scripts, and is in fact
 independent from the "reflection" proof style. It is implemented as a
 linkable extension to the Coq system.
