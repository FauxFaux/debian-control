Description: Enhanced TightVNC viewer with SSL/SSH tunnel helper
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop'
 environment not only on the machine where it is running, but from
 anywhere on the Internet and from a wide variety of machine
 architectures.
 .
 SSVNC is two things:
 .
 * An enhanced version of the TightVNC client with support for more
 encodings and color modes, support for x11vnc and UltraVNC
 extensions, dynamic screen resizing, an improved popup menu, etc.
 .
 * A GUI that helps set up an SSL (using stunnel) or SSH tunnel to
 connect to the VNC server through, as well as forwarding of ports for
 audio (esound/aRts), SMB, CUPS etc.
