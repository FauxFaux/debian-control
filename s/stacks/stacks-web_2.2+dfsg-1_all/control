Description: web interface for displaying loci from short-read sequences
 Stacks is a software pipeline for building loci from short-read sequences,
 such as those generated on the Illumina platform. Stacks was developed to work
 with restriction enzyme-based data, such as RAD-seq, for the purpose of
 building genetic maps and conducting population genomics and phylogeography.
 .
 This package provides the web-based viewer which you can use to examine Stacks
 output that has been loaded into a MySQL database.
