Description: pipeline for building loci from short-read DNA sequences
 Stacks is a software pipeline for building loci from short-read sequences,
 such as those generated on the Illumina platform. Stacks was developed to work
 with restriction enzyme-based data, such as RAD-seq, for the purpose of
 building genetic maps and conducting population genomics and phylogeography.
 .
 Note that this package installs Stacks such that all commands must be run as:
 $ stacks <cmdname> <args>
