Description: programs for maniuplating DNA sequencing files (usage examples)
 The io_lib from the Staden package is a library of file reading and writing
 code to provide a general purpose trace file (and Experiment File) reading
 interface. It has been compiled and tested on a variety of unix systems,
 MacOS X and MS Windows.
 .
 This package contains the programs that are distributed with the Staden io_lib
 for manipulating and converting sequencing data files, and in particular files
 to maniuplate short reads generated by second and third generation sequencers
 and stored in SRF format.
 .
 This package contains example data and a test suite to test the data.
