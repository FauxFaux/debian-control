Description: programs for maniuplating DNA sequencing files
 The io_lib from the Staden package is a library of file reading and writing
 code to provide a general purpose trace file (and Experiment File) reading
 interface. It has been compiled and tested on a variety of unix systems,
 MacOSÂ X and MS Windows.
