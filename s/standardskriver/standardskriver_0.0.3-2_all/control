Description: Tool for dynamically setting a user's default printer at desktop session logon
 The Standard Skriver Tool ('standardskriver' is Norwegian, i.e. Bokm√•l,
 for "default printer") allows the site admin to dynamically update
 a user's default printer setting at logon time.
 .
 At desktop session startup, a new default printer gets automatically
 configured based on the location of the client host in use and/or also
 based on POSIX group memberships of the current user.
 .
 Standard Skriver uses an easy-to-setup INI configuration file. The
 configuration syntax also supports for configuring of multiple sites, so
 one configuration file can be deployed to multiple sites.
