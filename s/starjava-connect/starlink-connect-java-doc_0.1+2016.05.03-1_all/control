 Classes related to persistent connections to remote services.
 Currently the main service provided by the connections defined here
 is access to some kind of filesystem which is modelled as a simple
 tree structure library, implemented in pure Java. Connection implementations
 are supplied by classes in other packages
 .
 This package contains the JavaDoc documentation of the package.
