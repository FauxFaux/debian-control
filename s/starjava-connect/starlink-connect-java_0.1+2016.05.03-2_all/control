Description: Abstract classes for persistent connections to remote services
 Classes related to persistent connections to remote services.
 Currently the main service provided by the connections defined here
 is access to some kind of filesystem which is modelled as a simple
 tree structure library, implemented in pure Java. Connection implementations
 are supplied by classes in other packages
