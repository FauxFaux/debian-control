Description: Classes for general FITS handling (javadoc)
 Classes for general FITS handling, including NDX, NDArray and
 StarTable implementations.
 .
 Some of these classes use the nom.tam.fits package (libfits-java) for
 low-level FITS access, though several of them do most of the handling
 in customised ways themselves for efficiency reasons.
 .
 This package contains the JavaDoc documentation of the package.
