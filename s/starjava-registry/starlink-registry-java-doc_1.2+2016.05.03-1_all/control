Description: Starlink IVOA registry access (API docs)
 This package provides a set of classes which can be used to make
 lightweight queries of an RI 1.0-compliant IVOA registry. In the
 Virtual Observatory (VO), registries provide a means for discovering
 useful resources, i.e., data and services. Individual publishers
 offer the descriptions for their resources ("resource records") in
 publishing registries.
 .
 This package contains the JavaDoc documentation of the package.
