Description: Starlink IVOA registry access
 This package provides a set of classes which can be used to make
 lightweight queries of an RI 1.0-compliant IVOA registry. In the
 Virtual Observatory (VO), registries provide a means for discovering
 useful resources, i.e., data and services. Individual publishers
 offer the descriptions for their resources ("resource records") in
 publishing registries.
 .
 This is not an all-singing or all-dancing registry client. The focus
 is on something which does a limited job fast and in a small memory
 footprint.
