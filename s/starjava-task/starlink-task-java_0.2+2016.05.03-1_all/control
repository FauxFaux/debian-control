Description: Java framework for invoking user-level tasks
 This package provides the necessary infrastructure for writing
 tasks that do things for users, along the same lines as ADAM A-tasks.
 .
 At the moment all the necessary machinery is provided for invoking
 tasks from the command line in a way that looks ADAM-like,
 but it is designed so that, for instance, a GUI-style invoker
 could be written to invoke the same tasks.
