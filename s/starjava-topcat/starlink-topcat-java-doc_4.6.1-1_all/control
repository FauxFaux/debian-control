Description: Tool for OPerations on Catalogues And Tables (JavaDoc)
 TOPCAT is an interactive graphical viewer and editor for tabular
 data. Its aim is to provide most of the facilities that astronomers
 need for analysis and manipulation of source catalogues and other
 tables, though it can be used for non-astronomical data as well. It
 understands a number of different astronomically important formats
 (including FITS and VOTable) and more formats can be added.
 .
 This package contains the JavaDoc documentation of the package.
