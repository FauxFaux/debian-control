Description: Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library Tool Set
 The STIL Tool Set is a set of command-line tools based on STIL, the
 Starlink Tables Infrastructure Library. It deals with the processing
 of tabular data; the package has been designed for, but is not
 restricted to, astronomical tables such as object catalogues. Some of
 the tools are generic and can work with multiple formats (including
 FITS, VOTable, CDF, CSV, SQL and ASCII), and others are
 specific to the VOTable format. In some ways, STILTS forms the
 command-line counterpart of the GUI table analysis tool TOPCAT. The
 package is robust, fully documented, and designed for efficiency,
 especially with very large datasets.
