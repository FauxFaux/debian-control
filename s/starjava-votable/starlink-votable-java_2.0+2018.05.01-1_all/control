Description: Classes for VOTable input and output
 The VOTable format is an XML standard for the interchange of data
 represented as a set of tables. In this context, a table is an
 unordered set of rows, each of a uniform structure, as specified in
 the table description (the table metadata). VOTable was designed to
 be close to the FITS Binary Table format.
