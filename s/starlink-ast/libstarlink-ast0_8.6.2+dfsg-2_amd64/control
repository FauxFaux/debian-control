Description: Handle World Coordinate Systems in Astronomy (main shared lib)
 AST implements an object oriented model for describing physical
 coordinate systems, and the transformations that exist between them.
 .
 It provides a comprehensive range of facilities for attaching world
 coordinate systems (WCS) to astronomical data and for retrieving and
 manipulating that information.
 .
 It has built-in intelligence for identifying types of celestial,
 spectral, time and other coordinate systems (including
 compound systems that combine axes of different types)
 and determining how to transform between them. This
 allows general purpose code to be written that makes no
 assumptions about the nature of the coordinate systems.
 .
 This package contains the main shared library.
