Description: Task scheduler for heterogeneous multicore machines - tools
 StarPU is a runtime system that offers support for heterogeneous
 multicore machines. While many efforts are devoted to design efficient
 computation kernels for those architectures (e.g. to implement BLAS
 kernels on GPUs or on Cell's SPUs), StarPU not only takes care of
 offloading such kernels (and implementing data coherency across
 the machine), but it also makes sure the kernels are executed as
 efficiently as possible.
 .
 This package contains StarPU tools.
 This "contrib" version is built against CUDA.
