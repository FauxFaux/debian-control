Description: Status bar widgets and progress indicators for Firefox 4+
 That status bar was removed in Firefox 4.0. While some of the status bar items
 did find new homes, some did not, and you might not like where they ended up.
 There were also some nice innovations during the development of Firefox 4.0,
 such as progress/links/status in the location bar, which unfortunately didn't
 make it to the final release.
 .
 Status-4-Evar aims to bring back (some of) the old status bar items, give you
 more control over the built-in Firefox features, and provide new alternatives.
 .
 There are also options to tweak the appearance and behaviour of the progress
 bar and download indicators. (This covers the entire functionality of the
 xul-ext-fission package, incompatible with later browser versions.)
