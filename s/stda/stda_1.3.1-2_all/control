Description: simple tools for data analysis (stda)
 This package contains some primary tools for evaluating sums, averages,
 integrals, derivatives, histograms/distributions of 1-d numerical data, and
 eventually for plotting the results. The stand-alone programs (supporting
 the standard UNIX input and output pipelines) are intended for data processing
 from the command line. They are especially useful for straightforward analysis
 of number series where a complex analytical approach is not necessary.
 .
 Following programs are included:
  * maphimbu   - histogram builder for 1-d numerical and text data;
  * mintegrate - evaluate average/sum/integral/derivative of 1-d numerical data;
  * mmval      - find minimum and maximum value in a dataset;
  * muplot     - plot a multi-curve figure from multiple dataset using Gnuplot;
  * nnum       - produce a series of integers or floats;
  * prefield   - prepare input file for 'muplot' to plot 2-d fields by arrows.
