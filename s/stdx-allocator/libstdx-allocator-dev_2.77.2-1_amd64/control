Description: High-level interface for allocators for D -- development files
 This D module implements bundled allocation/creation and
 destruction/deallocation of data including structs and classes,
 and also array primitives related to allocation.
 .
 The module is part of the D standard library as well, but has
 been split out into a separate library to allow using the most
 recent std.experimental.allocator with older D versions.
 .
 This package contains development files for the D programming language.
