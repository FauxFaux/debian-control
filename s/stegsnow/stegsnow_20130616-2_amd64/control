Description: steganography using ASCII files
 This utility can conceal messages in ASCII text by appending
 whitespace to the end of lines. Because spaces and tabs are generally
 not visible in text viewers, the message is effectively hidden from
 casual observers. And if the built-in encryption is used, the message
 cannot be read even if it is detected.
 .
 About the name: locating trailing whitespace in text is like finding
 a polar bear in a snowstorm. And it uses the ICE encryption
 algorithm, so the name is thematically consistent.
