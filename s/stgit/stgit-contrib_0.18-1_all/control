Description: set of contributed script to help working with stgit
 Among others, this package provides the following helper scripts:
  * stg-gitk: show all patches in gitk, not only applied ones, and hide logs
  * stg-whatchanged: examine changes that would modify the current patch
  * stg-fold-files-from: pick specific hunks from another patch up the stack
  * stg-dispatch: dispatch specific hunks into another patch down the stack
  * stg-swallow: completely merge another patch into the current one
  * stg-k: provide robust --keep functionality to all stgit commands
 .
 Most of the functionality of these scripts may one day be incorporated into
 stgit.
