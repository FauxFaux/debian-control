Description: manage stacks of patches in a git repository
 stgit provides similar functionality to quilt
 (i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) on top of git.
 .
 These operations are performed using git commands and the patches
 are stored as git commit objects, allowing easy merging of the stgit
 patches into other repositories using standard git functionality.
