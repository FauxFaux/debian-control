Description: Suite of commands for generating, inspecting and manipulating STL files
 stl_cmd is a suite of command line tools for generating, inspecting and
 manipulating STL files which are often used in 3D printing. The goal of this
 project is to be a resource for teaching terminal usage and some basic
 programming concepts in the 3D printing space. Imagine an assignment which
 involves building a brick wall. Students would need to use a combination of
 stl_cube, stl_transform and stl_merge. The commands could be combined in a
 bash or <insert favorite scripting language> script with for and while
 loops, could accept input and use conditionals to affect the attributes of
 the wall.
