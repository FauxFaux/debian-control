Description: Software Token for cryptographic authentication - development files
 stoken is a software token which generates one-time passwords compatible
 with RSA SecurID 128-bit (AES) tokens.  SecurID tokens are commonly
 used to authenticate end users to protected network resources and VPNs,
 as OTPs provide greater resistance to many attacks associated with static
 passwords.
 .
 stoken aims to provide a Linux-friendly, free software alternative to the
 proprietary RSA SecurID Software Authenticators.
 .
 This package provides the headers and static libraries for libstoken.
