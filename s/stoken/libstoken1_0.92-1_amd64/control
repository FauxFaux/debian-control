Description: Software Token for cryptographic authentication - shared library
 stoken is a software token which generates one-time passwords compatible
 with RSA SecurID 128-bit (AES) tokens.  SecurID tokens are commonly
 used to authenticate end users to protected network resources and VPNs,
 as OTPs provide greater resistance to many attacks associated with static
 passwords.
 .
 stoken aims to provide a Linux-friendly, free software alternative to the
 proprietary RSA SecurID Software Authenticators.
 .
 This package provides a shared library allowing other applications, such
 as VPN clients and web browsers, to generate tokencodes.  This can improve
 both ease of use and security, as the user does not need to copy and paste
 tokencodes between applications.
