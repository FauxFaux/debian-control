Description: Python client implementation of the STOMP protocol (Python 2)
 The client is attempting to be transport layer neutral. This module provides
 functions to create and parse STOMP messages in a programmatic fashion. The
 messages can be easily generated and parsed, however its up to the user to do
 the sending and receiving.
 .
 The Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol is a text-based protocol
 vaguely similar to HTTP, intended for message oriented middleware. Its
 protocol specification can be found at
 http://stomp.github.io/
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 2.
