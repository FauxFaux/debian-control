Description: Stop and instrument definitions for Aeolus
 Aeolus is a synthesised (i.e. not sampled) pipe organ emulator that
 should be good enough to make an organist enjoy playing it. It is a
 software synthesiser optimised for this job, with possibly hundreds
 of controls for each stop, that enable the user to "voice" his
 instrument.
 .
 This package contains definitions of stops and of an instrument
 to be used with the aeolus organ synth.
