Description: Free story planning and writing application for children
 StoryMaps is a graphical story planning and writing application for
 children that breaks down the elements of traditional fairy tales into
 building blocks, following Vladimir Propp's plot functions.
 .
 With StoryMaps children can easily create their own stories:
 selecting the plot cards with the story cards, creating a story map
 and writing their own story using a text editor. Once finished, the
 application can be used to export the story into HTML format.
