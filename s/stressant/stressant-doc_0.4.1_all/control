Description: simple stress testing and burn-in tool (documentation)
 stressant is designed to run on new machines to make sure they will
 work reliably by testing various parts of the system (CPU, RAM, disk,
 network) by putting them under heavy load and try to detect failures.
 .
 As much as possible, stressant tries to reuse existing tools to
 perform the various tasks and aims to be run automatically.
 .
 This package ships the Sphinx documentation builtin to Stressant.
