Description: file non-deterministic information stripper — Debhelper add-on
 StripNondeterminism is a library for stripping non-deterministic information
 such as timestamps and filesystem ordering from various file and archive
 formats.
 .
 This can be used as a post-processing step to improve the reproducibility of a
 build product, when the build process itself cannot be made deterministic.
 .
 It is used as part of the Reproducible Builds project, although it should be
 considered a temporary workaround which should not be needed in the long
 term; upstream software should be reproducible even without using such a tool.
 .
 This package installs the ‘dh_strip_nondeterminism’ Debhelper command that
 strips nondeterminism as part of a Debian package build process.
