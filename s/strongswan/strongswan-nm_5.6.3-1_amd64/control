Description: strongSwan plugin to interact with NetworkManager
 The strongSwan VPN suite uses the native IPsec stack in the standard
 Linux kernel. It supports both the IKEv1 and IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 This plugin provides an interface which allows NetworkManager to configure
 and control the IKEv2 daemon directly through D-Bus. It is designed to work
 in conjunction with the network-manager-strongswan package, providing
 a simple graphical frontend to configure IPsec based VPNs.
