Description: dogtail inspired GUI test automation framework
 Strongwind is a GUI test automation framework inspired by dogtail.  Strongwind
 is object-oriented and extensible. You can use Strongwind to build
 object-oriented representations of your applications ("application wrappers"),
 then reuse the application wrappers to quickly develop many test scripts.
 Strongwind scripts generate a human-readable log that contains the action,
 expected result and a screen shot of each step.  Most simple actions are logged
 automatically.
 .
 Strongwind is written in Python and uses the pyatspi library to manipulate and
 query the state of applications. Strongwind automatically classifies widgets by
 their ATK role. By default, Strongwind provides implementations for common
 actions on regular widgets -- for example, selecting an item in a menu or
 asserting that a window has closed -- but you can extend Strongwind's
 implementations or add your own implementations for custom widgets to handle
 alternate behaviors or custom widgets in your applications.
