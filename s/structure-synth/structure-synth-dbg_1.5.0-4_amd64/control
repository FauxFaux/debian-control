Description: application for creating 3D structures
 Structure Synth is a tool for generating 3D structures by specifying a
 design grammar. Even simple systems may generate surprising and complex
 structures. Structure Synth offers a graphical environment with multiple
 tabs, syntax highlighting, and OpenGL preview. Integration with third-party
 renderers (such as Sunflow and POV-Ray) is possible using a flexible
 template based export system.
