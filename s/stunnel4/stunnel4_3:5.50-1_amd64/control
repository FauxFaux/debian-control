Description: Universal SSL tunnel for network daemons
 The stunnel program is designed to work  as  SSL  encryption
 wrapper between remote client and local (inetd-startable) or
 remote server. The concept is that having non-SSL aware daemons
 running  on  your  system you can easily setup them to
 communicate with clients over secure SSL channel.
 .
 stunnel can be used to add  SSL  functionality  to  commonly
 used  inetd  daemons  like  POP-2,  POP-3  and  IMAP servers
 without any changes in the programs' code.
 .
 This package contains a wrapper script for compatibility with stunnel 3.x
