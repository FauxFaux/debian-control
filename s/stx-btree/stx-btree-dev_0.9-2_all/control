Description: b+tree implementation in c++
 The STX B+ Tree package is a set of C++ template classes
 implementing a B+ tree key/data container in main memory.
 Designed to be drop-in replacements  of the STL containers
 set, map, multiset and multimap and follow their interfaces very closely.
 By packing multiple value pairs into each node
 of the tree the B+ tree reduces heap fragmentation and utilizes cache-line
 effects better than the standard red-black binary tree.
 The classes contain extensive assertion and verification mechanisms
 to ensure the implementation's correctness by testing the tree invariants.
 To illustrate the  B+ tree's structure a wxWidgets demo program is included
 in the stx-btree-demo package.
