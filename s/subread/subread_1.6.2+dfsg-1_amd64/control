Description: toolkit for processing next-gen sequencing data
 Subread aligner can be used to align both gDNA-seq and RNA-seq reads.
 Subjunc aligner was specified designed for the detection of exon-exon
 junction. For the mapping of RNA-seq reads, Subread performs local
 alignments and Subjunc performs global alignments.
