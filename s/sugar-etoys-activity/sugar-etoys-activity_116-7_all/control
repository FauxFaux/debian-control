Description: Etoys activity for Sugar Learning Platform
 Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
 Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
 education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
 offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.
 .
 Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software
 packages that automatically save your work - producing specific
 instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many
 Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may
 be invited to join a collective Activity session.
 .
 Squeak Etoys was inspired by LOGO, PARC-Smalltalk, Hypercard, and
 starLOGO. It is a media-rich authoring environment with a simple,
 powerful scripted object model for many kinds of objects created by
 end-users. It includes 2D and 3D graphics, images, text, particles,
 presentations, web-pages, videos, sound and MIDI, etc. It includes the
 ability to share desktops with other Etoy users in real-time, so many
 forms of immersive mentoring and play can be done over the Internet.
 .
 The Etoys activity embeds Squeak Etoys into Sugar.
