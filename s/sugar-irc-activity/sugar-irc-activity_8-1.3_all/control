Description: Sugar IRC Activity
 Sugar is a graphical user interface aimed at children.
 .
 Originating as integral part of the OLPC "XO" a.k.a. the $100 laptop,
 Sugar has since grown into a more widely usable low-resource desktop
 environment for kids.
 .
 This Activity allows you to contact other Sugar users and enthusiasts
 on the internet and chat with them. It uses a system called Internet
 Relay Chat, or IRC for short. There are several IRC channels for Sugar
 users and developers. It defaults to a "room" called #sugar, but you
 can also enter other rooms by typing /join #room where room is the
 name of the room you wish to join.
