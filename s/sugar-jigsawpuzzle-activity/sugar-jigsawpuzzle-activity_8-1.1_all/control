Description: a classic picture-constructing game for Sugar
 Sugar is a graphical user interface aimed at children.
 .
 Originating as intregral part of the OLPC "XO" a.k.a. the $100 laptop,
 Sugar has since grown into a more widely usable low-ressource desktop
 environment for kids.
 .
 This package contains the Jigsaw Puzzle activity.
 .
 Jigsaw Puzzle is based on the classic picture-constructing game, but
 has the option to add your own pictures. It strengthens visual, spacial
 and problem solving skills and offers a context to creatively reflect
 on and explore any subject. This is a WorldWideWorkshop project.
