Description: Sugar Learning Platform - log viewing and reporting activity
 Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
 Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
 education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
 offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.
 .
 Learner applications in Sugar are called Activities.  They are software
 packages that automatically save your work - producing specific
 instances of the Activity that can be resumed at a later time.  Many
 Activities support learner collaboration, where multiple learners may
 be invited to join a collective Activity session.
 .
 Log files are created when Activities run, and by other Sugar-related
 processes.  They list software errors, among other data, and can help
 diagnose software problems.
 .
 This package contains the Log activity to view Sugar-related log files.
