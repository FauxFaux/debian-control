Description: physics simulator for the Sugar graphical shell
 Sugar is a graphical user interface aimed at children.
 .
 Originating as integral part of the OLPC "XO" a.k.a. the $100 laptop,
 Sugar has since grown into a more widely usable low-resource desktop
 environment for kids.
 .
 This package contains the Physics activity. In it, you can add squares,
 circles, triangles, or draw your own shapes, and see them come to life
 with forces like gravity friction, and inertia.
