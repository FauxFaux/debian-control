Description: Sugar Learning Platform - graphical shell
 Sugar Learning Platform promotes collaborative learning through Sugar
 Activities that encourage critical thinking, the heart of a quality
 education.  Designed from the ground up especially for children, Sugar
 offers an alternative to traditional “office-desktop” software.

 "Jarabe" is Spanish for "Jelly" - a sugary layer spread on the surface.
 .
 This package contains the parts of Sugar Learning Platform immediately
 visible to the user - the views, the journal, and the control panel.
 .
 This is a graphical shell, the name does not refer to a command-line
 "shell" interface.
