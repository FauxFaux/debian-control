Description: categorize each suite in an RNA backbone
 Suitename is a program that supports the ROC RNA Ontology Consortium
 consensus RNA backbone nomenclature and conformer-list development.
 .
 From dihedral-angle input for a specific RNA structure (usually from
 Dangle), Suitename categorizes the RNA backbone geometry of each suite
 (the sugar-to-sugar version of a residue) either as an outlier or
 as belonging to one of the 53 defined conformer bins. The output is
 either a one-line-per-suite report, or a linear conformer string (as
 shown below the image here) in one of several variant formats. Suitename
 is built into MolProbity, producing entries in the multi-criterion chart
 for an RNA model and also a suitestring file.
