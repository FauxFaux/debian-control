Description: graph algorithms via sparse matrix operations on semirings
 Suitesparse is a collection of libraries for computations involving
 sparse matrices.
 .
 SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS is an full implementation of the GraphBLAS standard,
 which defines a set of sparse matrix operations on an extended algebra of
 semirings using an almost unlimited variety of operators and types. When
 applied to sparse adjacency matrices, these algebraic operations are
 equivalent to computations on graphs. GraphBLAS provides a powerful and
 expressive framework for creating graph algorithms based on the elegant
 mathematics of sparse matrix operations on a semiring.
