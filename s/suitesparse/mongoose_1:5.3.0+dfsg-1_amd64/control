Description: graph partitioning tool that can quickly compute edge cuts (executable)
 Suitesparse is a collection of libraries for computations involving
 sparse matrices.
 .
 Mongoose is a graph partitioning library that can quickly compute edge cuts in
 arbitrary graph. Given a graph with a vertex set and edge set, an edge cut is
 a partitioning of the graph into two subgraphs that are balanced (contain the
 same number of vertices) and the connectivity between the subgraphs is
 minimized (few edges are in the cut).
 .
 This package contains the standalone executable.
