Description: differential equation solver (SUNDIALS library)
 This package contains the library for differential equation (ODE) system
 solvers from SUNDIALS (SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation
 Solvers). ARKODE is a solver for multi-rate ODE systems (initial value
 problems) given in explicit form M*dy/dt = f(t,y)
