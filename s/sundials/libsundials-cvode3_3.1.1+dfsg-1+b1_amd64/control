Description: ordinary differential equation solver (SUNDIALS library)
 This package contains the library for ordinary differential equation (ODE)
 system solvers from SUNDIALS (SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic
 equation Solvers). CVODE is a solver for stiff and nonstiff ODE systems
 (initial value problem) given in explicit form dy/dt = f(t,y).
