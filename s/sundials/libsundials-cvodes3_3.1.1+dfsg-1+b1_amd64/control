Description: ODE solver with sensistivity analysis (SUNDIALS library)
 This package contains the library for ordinary differential equation (ODE)
 system solver with sensistivity analysis capabilities from SUNDIALS (SUite of
 Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers). CVODES is a solver for
 stiff and nonstiff ODE systems (initial value problem) given in explicit form
 y' = f(t,y,p) with sensitivity analysis capabilities (both forward and adjoint
 modes).
