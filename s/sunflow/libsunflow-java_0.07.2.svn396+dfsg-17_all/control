Description: rendering system for photo-realistic image synthesis
 Sunflow is an open source rendering system for photo-realistic image
 synthesis. It is written in Java and built around a flexible ray
 tracing core and an extensible object-oriented design. It was created
 as a framework for experimenting with global illumination algorithms
 and new surface shading models.
