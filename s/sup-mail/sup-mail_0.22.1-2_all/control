Description: thread-centric mailer with tagging and fast search
 Sup is a console-based email client for people with a lot of email. It
 supports tagging, very fast full-text search, automatic contact-list
 management, custom code insertion via a hook system, and more. If
 you're the type of person who treats email as an extension of your
 long-term memory, Sup is for you.
 .
 Sup makes it easy to:
    * Handle massive amounts of email.
    * Mix email from different sources: mbox files and Maildirs, across
      multiple machines.
    * Instantaneously search over your entire email collection. Search
      over body text, or use a query language to combine search predicates
      in any way.
    * Handle multiple accounts. Replying to email sent to a particular
      account will use the correct SMTP server, signature, and from address.
    * Add custom code to handle certain types of messages or to handle
      certain types of text within messages.
    * Organize email with user-defined labels, automatically track recent
      contacts, and much more!
 .
 The goal of Sup is to become the email client of choice for nerds everywhere.
