Description: Documentation for Super CSV library for Java
 It is highly configurable, and supports reading and writing with POJOs,
 Maps and Lists. It also has support for deep-mapping and index-based
 mapping with POJOs, using the powerful Dozer extension.
 .
 Its flexible 'Cell Processor' API automates data type conversions
 (parsing and formatting Dates, Integers, Booleans etc) and enforces
 constraints (mandatory columns, matching against regular expressions
 etc) - and it's easy to write your own if required.
 .
 This package contains the API documentation of libsuper-csv-java.
