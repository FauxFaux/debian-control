Description: auto-save buffers, based on your activity
 This package provides Emacs mode that auto-saves your buffers, when
 certain events happen - e.g. you switch between buffers, an Emacs
 frame loses focus, etc. One can think of it as both something that
 augments and replaces the standard auto-save-mode.
