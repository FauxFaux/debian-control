Description: program that colorizes text for terminals and HTML
 Supercat is a program that colorizes text based on matching regular
 expressions/strings/characters. Supercat supports html output as well
 as standard ASCII text. Unlike some text-colorizing programs that
 exist, Supercat does not require you to have to be a programmer to
 make colorization rules.
