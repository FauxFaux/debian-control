Description: Super I/O detection tool
 Superiotool is a user-space utility which can
 .
   - detect which Super I/O chip is soldered onto your mainboard,
 .
   - at which configuration port it's located (usually 0x2e or 0x4e), and
 .
   - dump all register contents of the Super I/O chip, together with the
     default values as per datasheet (to make comparing the values easy).
 .
 It is mainly used for coreboot (previously known as LinuxBIOS) development
 purposes (see coreboot.org for details on coreboot), but it may also be
 useful for other things.
