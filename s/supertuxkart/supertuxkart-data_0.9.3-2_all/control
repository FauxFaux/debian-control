Description: 3D kart racing game (data)
 SuperTuxKart is a free 3D kart racing game, with a focus on having fun over
 realism. You can play with up to 4 friends on one PC, racing against each
 other or just trying to beat the computer; single-player mode is also
 available.
 .
 See the great lighthouse or drive through the sand and visit the pyramids.
 Race underground or in space, watching the stars pass by. Or rest under the
 palm trees on the beach, watching the other karts overtake you. But don't eat
 the bananas! Watch for bowling balls, plungers, bubble gum and cakes thrown by
 your opponents.
 .
 You can do a single race against other karts, compete in one of several Grand
 Prix, try to beat the high score in time trials on your own, play battle mode
 against your friends, and more!
