Description: Documentation for lua-supple
 Supple is a very strict sandbox which runs Lua code on behalf of applications
 which cannot trust the code very much.
 .
 Supple relies on a number of techniques to sandbox the user code away from the
 host application, such as chroots, seccomp mode, interpreter sandboxing, and
 rlimits.
 .
 This package contains the documentation on how to use the Supple library.
