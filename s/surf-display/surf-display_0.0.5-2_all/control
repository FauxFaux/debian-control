Description: Kiosk browser session manager based on the surf browser
 Provide an X11 session manager script that launches a minimal window
 manager and then opens an entry web page via the surf web browser in
 kiosk mode. The web page can be consumed "read-only" or in interactive
 mode.
 .
 In combination with the nodm display manager you can provide an
 easy-to-setup html'ish display screen or a web terminal.
 .
 If URL/domain filtering is needed, combine surf-display with a local
 instance of tinyproxy.
 .
 After a configurable idle time, the browser session is fully
 reset and started anew.
