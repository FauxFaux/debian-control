Description: Fetch and install SUSv4 (POSIX.1-2017)
 The Single Unix Specifications are not permitted to be generally
 redistributed, so this is an installer that fetches them and installs
 them in a Debian appropriate way.  This installer will fetch and
 install POSIX.1-2017 (variously also known as IEEE Std 1003.1-2017,
 The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7, 2018 Edition, or
 Single Unix Specification v4, 2018 edition).
