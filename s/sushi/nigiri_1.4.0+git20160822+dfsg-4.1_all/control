Description: D-Bus-based IRC suite (terminal client)
 The sushi IRC suite consists of a central daemon and several clients, which
 communicate via DBus. DBus methods and signals are provided by the daemon to
 abstract the IRC protocol. Clients can use these methods and signals to
 easily interact with IRC.
 .
 nigiri is a terminal client for maki and is written in Python. It uses Urwid
 to realize the interface and supports plugins.
