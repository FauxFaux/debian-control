Description: D-Bus-based IRC suite (graphical client)
 The sushi IRC suite consists of a central daemon and several clients, which
 communicate via DBus. DBus methods and signals are provided by the daemon to
 abstract the IRC protocol. Clients can use these methods and signals to
 easily interact with IRC.
 .
 tekka is a GTK-driven client for maki and is written in Python. It uses Glade
 to describe the interface, supports plugins and tries to stick to the GNOME
 Human Interface (HIG) guidelines.
