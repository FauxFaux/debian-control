Description: SVG engine for Java
 SVG Salamander is an SVG engine for Java that's designed to be small,
 fast, and allow programmers to use it with a minimum of fuss.
 .
 It's in particular targeted for making it easy to integrate SVG into
 Java games and making it much easier for artists to design 2D game
 content - from rich interactive menus to charts and graphcs to
 complex animations.
