Description: fast-import based converter to convert repos from Subversion to git
 svn-all-fast-export is a tool to convert Subversion repositories to git.
 .
 This tool takes a copy of the Subversion repository (not just a checkout)
 plus a rules file that specifies how the conversion should be performed and
 produces a bare git repository. Using regular expressions, the rules file
 specifies how the Subversion branches and tags should be created in the git
 repository. Example rule files are included in
 /usr/share/doc/svn-all-fast-export/examples
 .
 An authors file that maps the old svn accounts to the full authors names and
 email addresses can also be provided to make the history look much prettier.
