Description: Ruby tool for migrating svn projects to git
 Svn2git is a tiny utility for migrating projects from Subversion to Git
 while keeping the trunk, branches and tags where they should be. It uses
 git-svn to clone an svn repository and does some clean-up to make sure
 branches and tags are imported in a meaningful way, and that the code
 checked into master ends up being what's currently in your svn trunk
 rather than whichever svn branch your last commit was in.
