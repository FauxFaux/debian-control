Description: extensible Subversion commit notification tool
 The svnmailer is a tool, which is usually called by a Subversion hook
 to submit commit notifications in various ways (at the moment: mail via
 SMTP or a pipe to a sendmail like program, news via NNTP, CIA live
 tracker notification via XML-RPC). It is derived from the original
 mailer.py distributed with Subversion, but supposed to be much more
 consistent, better extensible and to have much more features. Have a
 look at the documentation for further details.
