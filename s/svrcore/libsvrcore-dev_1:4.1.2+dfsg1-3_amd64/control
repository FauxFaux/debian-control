Description: Development files for Netscape's secure PIN storage library
 Svrcore is a library for handling PIN requests from Mozilla's Network
 Security Service (NSS) library. It provides a standard way for servers
 to allow PIN input from a file or from the terminal. There is also a PIN
 handler that caches the PIN in memory after encrypting it with a key stored
 on a PKCS11 device, thereby allowing a server to restart without reentering
 the PIN.
 .
 This package contains header files and symlinks to develop programs which will
 use the libsvrcore library.  You should install this package if you need to
 develop programs which will use the svrcore library.
