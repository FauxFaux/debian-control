Description: Netscape's secure PIN storage library
 Svrcore is a library for handling PIN requests from Mozilla's Network
 Security Service (NSS) library. It provides a standard way for servers
 to allow PIN input from a file or from the terminal. There is also a PIN
 handler that caches the PIN in memory after encrypting it with a key stored
 on a PKCS11 device, thereby allowing a server to restart without reentering
 the PIN.
