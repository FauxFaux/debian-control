Description: audio collections of words (SWAC) manager
 Swac-get is a simple command line program written in C++ which allows to
 install audio collections of words (SWAC) in a SQLite3 database.
 Audio collections can be imported from the hard drive or directly from the
 Internet using the HTTP protocol.
 Swac-get is designed to be used with swac-explore, a GTK+ interface which
 allows to browse the created SQLite3 database.
 An important set of free audio collections of words (SWAC) is available at:
