Description: Semantic Web Archive of Mailing Lists
 SWAML reads a collection of email messages stored in a mailbox
 (from a mailing list compatible with RFC 4155) and generates a
 RDF description. It is written in Python using SIOC as the main
 ontology to represent in RDF a mailing list, including the next
 features:
 .
   * Platform independent.
   * Text-based.
   * Compatible with RFC 4155.
   * Serialize RDF to disk.
   * Reusability of ontologies already extended, mainly SIOC.
   * Enrichment using FOAF.
   * KML support.
