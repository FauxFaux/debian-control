Description: RDF/XML and RDF/N3 semantic web data processor
 Cwm (pronounced coom) is a general-purpose data processor for the
 semantic web, somewhat like sed, awk, etc. for text files or XSLT for
 XML. It is a forward chaining reasoner which can be used for querying,
 checking, transforming and filtering information. Its core language is
 RDF, extended to include rules, and it uses RDF/XML or RDF/N3
 (Notation3) serializations as required.
 .
 Also included is the RDF tools cant and delta.
