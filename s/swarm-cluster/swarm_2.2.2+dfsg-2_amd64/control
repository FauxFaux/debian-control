Description: robust and fast clustering method for amplicon-based studies
 The purpose of swarm is to provide a novel clustering algorithm to handle large
 sets of amplicons. Traditional clustering algorithms results are strongly
 input-order dependent, and rely on an arbitrary global clustering threshold.
 swarm results are resilient to input-order changes and rely on a small local
 linking threshold d, the maximum number of differences between two amplicons.
 swarm forms stable high-resolution clusters, with a high yield of biological
 information.
