Description: Data for swath Thai word segmentation program
 Swath is a general-purpose utility for analyzing word boundaries in Thai
 text and inserting predefined word delimiter codes. It can be used as a
 filter for Thai LaTeX files so the lines are wrapped properly when processed
 with babel-thai macros. Other formats that swath can also handle include
 HTML, RTF and plain text.
 .
 This package contains data files needed by the swath program.
