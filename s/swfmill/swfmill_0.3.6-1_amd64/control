Description: xml2swf and swf2xml processor
 swfmill is a tool to process Shockwave Flash(TM) (SWF) files. It can
 convert SWF from and to an XML-dialect called swfml, which is closely
 modeled after the SWF file format.
 .
 Apart from this xml2swf and swf2xml functionality, it also provides a
 libxslt-based XSL transformator that supports an extension ("swft")
 which helps with generating IDs for SWF objects and can import an SWF as
 XML using an XPath command (swft:document()).
 .
 As a simple application of such functionality, swfmill can pack together
 a bunch of media files (currently JPGs, PNGs, TTFs and other SWFs) into
 an SWF as "library objects" for your attachMovie() pleasure.
