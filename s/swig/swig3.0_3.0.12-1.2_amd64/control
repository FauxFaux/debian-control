Description: Generate scripting interfaces to C/C++ code
 SWIG is a compiler that makes it easy to integrate C and C++ code
 with other languages including Perl, Tcl, Ruby, Python, Java,
 Guile, Mzscheme, Chicken, OCaml, Pike, and C#.
 .
 Swig takes a set of ANSI C/C++ declarations and generates an
 interface for them to your favorite scripting language.
