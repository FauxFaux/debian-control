Description: Swiss Railway Clock for the X Window System
 Swisswatch is a clock for the X desktop.  It relies heavily on resources for
 configuration, and can be adjusted to a wide range of looks.  While it can be
 configured completely via resources and provides looks for a Botta (SFMoMA)
 clock style, an oclock emulation and other appearances, it defaults to the
 style of a Swiss Railway Clock.
