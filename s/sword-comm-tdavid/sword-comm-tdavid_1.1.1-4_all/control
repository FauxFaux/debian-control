Description: C. H. Spurgeon's Treasury of David for SWORD
 This seven volume "magnum opus", by Charles H. Spurgeon, was first
 published in weekly installments over a twenty-year span in the London
 Metropolitan Tabernacle's periodical, The Sword and the Trowel. As each
 section was completed it was published as a volume until the seventh and
 final volume was released in 1885.
 .
 This package requires a libsword version of at least 1.5.1a to access
 through a SWORD front end.  However, this is not declared as a dependency
 because you may have occasion to install just the text without any sort
 of front end or other interface.
