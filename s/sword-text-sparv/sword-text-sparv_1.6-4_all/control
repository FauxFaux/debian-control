Description: Spanish Reina-Valera Bible (1909) for SWORD
 The Reina-Valera Bible (1909) is a Spanish Bible translation based on
 the Textus Receptus.
 .
 This package requires a libsword version of at least 1.5.9 to access
 through a SWORD front end.  However, this is not declared as a dependency
 because you may have occasion to install just the text without any sort
 of front end or other interface.
