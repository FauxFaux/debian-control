Description: Simplified Java Printing Support for SWT
 Simple, light weight, extensible Java printing plug-in for SWT. PaperClips
 hides the complexity of laying out and rendering documents on the printer,
 helping you focus on what to print instead of how to print it.
 .
 In a nutshell, PaperClips provides an assortment of document "building
 blocks," which you can tweak and combine to form a custom document. The
 assembled document is then sent to PaperClips for printing. PaperClips
 includes support for printing text, images, borders, headers and footers,
 column layouts and grid layouts, to name a few. It can also be extended with
 your own printable classes.
 .
 With PaperClips you do not have to track cursors, calculate line breaking,
 fool around with font metrics, or manage system resources--it's all handled
 internally. And unlike report-generation tools, you are not constrained to a
 predefined document structure (like report bands). Every document is custom
 and the layout is up to you.
