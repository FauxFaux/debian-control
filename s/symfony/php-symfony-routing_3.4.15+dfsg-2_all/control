Description: associate a request with code that generates a response
 The Symfony Routing Component makes it easy to map HTTP requests to
 the code of an application that is able to process the request and
 generates a corresponding response. It thus serves as a router for an
 application, but should not be confused with a network router.
 .
 Symfony is a PHP framework, a set of tools and a development methodology.
