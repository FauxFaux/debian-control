Description: infrastructure for authorization systems - common features
 The Symfony Security Component - Core Library provides all the common
 security features, from authentication to authorization and from
 encoding passwords to loading users.
 .
 The Symfony Security Component makes it possible to easily separate
 authorization logic from user providers that hold the users credentials.
 It ships with facilities for authenticating using HTTP basic or digest
 authentication, interactive form login or X.509 certificate login.
 Furthermore it optionally also allows an application to implement its
 own authentication strategies.
 .
 Symfony is a PHP framework, a set of tools and a development methodology.
