Description: Symmetrica Combinatoric C Library -- development package
 Symmetrica is a library for combinatorics. It has support for the
 representation theory of the symmetric group and related groups,
 combinatorics of tableaux, symmetric functions and polynomials,
 Schubert polynomials, and the representation theory of Hecke algebras
 of type A_n.
 .
 This package contains the header files, static libraries and symbolic
 links that developers using the Symmetrica Combinatoric C Library will
 need.
