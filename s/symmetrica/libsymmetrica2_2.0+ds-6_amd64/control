Description: Symmetrica Combinatoric C Library -- library package
 Symmetrica is a library for combinatorics. It has support for the
 representation theory of the symmetric group and related groups,
 combinatorics of tableaux, symmetric functions and polynomials,
 Schubert polynomials, and the representation theory of Hecke algebras
 of type A_n.
