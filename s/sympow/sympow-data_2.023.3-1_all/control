Description: mathematical program for SYMmetric POWer elliptic curve L-functions -- shared
 SYMPOW is a mathematical program to compute special values of symmetric
 power elliptic curve L-functions; it can compute up to about 64 digits
 of precision.
 .
 This package provides the essential SYMPOW architecture independent
 material, namely shared data and scripts.
