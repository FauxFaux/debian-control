Description: Python shell for SymPy
 SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics (manipulation). It aims to
 become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as
 simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy
 is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries,
 except optionally for plotting support.
 .
 This support package contains the common isympy python script,
 a wrapper for SymPy which can be invoked with either python2 or python3.
 .
 Install the isympy or isympy3 package to ensure all required dependencies
 are loaded.
