Description: Sync personal information data via SyncML/CalDAV/CardDAV (HTTP server)
 SyncEvolution synchronizes contact, calendar and task items via SyncML and
 CalDAV/CardDAV with other servers or devices. It uses the Evolution Data Server
 to sync PIM data in Evolution, but a plain file storage is also supported.
 Data exchange can happen via HTTP(S) and Bluetooth. Full, one-way and
 incremental synchronization of items are supported. SyncEvolution can act as
 a SyncML/DAV client and SyncML server.
 .
 This package provides a python script to make SyncEvolution act as a HTTP(S)
 server for other SyncML clients.
