Description: IDL parser for synopsis
 Synopsis is a multi-language source code introspection tool that
 provides a variety of representations for the parsed code to enable
 further processing such as documentation extraction, reverse
 engineering, and source-to-source translation.
 .
 Synopsis provides a framework of C++ and Python APIs to access these
 representations and allows Processor objects to be defined and
 composed into processing pipelines, making this framework very
 flexible and extensible.
 .
 This package contains the IDL parser.
