Description: multi-threaded benchmark tool for database systems
 SysBench is a modular, scriptable and multi-threaded benchmark tool based on
 LuaJIT. It is most frequently used for database benchmarks, but can also be
 used to create arbitrarily complex workloads that do not involve a database
 server.
 .
 The idea of this benchmark suite is to quickly get an impression about system
 performance without setting up complex database benchmarks or even without
 installing a database at all.
 .
 Current features allow one to test the following system parameters:
 .
  * file I/O performance
  * scheduler performance
  * memory allocation and transfer speed
  * POSIX threads implementation performance
  * database server performance (OLTP benchmark)
 .
 Primarily written for MySQL server benchmarking, SysBench will be further
 extended to support multiple database backends, distributed benchmarks and
 third-party plug-in modules.
