Description: sysfs query tool and boot-time setup
 Sysfs is a virtual file system in Linux kernel 2.5+ that provides a
 tree of system devices. This package provides the program 'systool' to query
 it: it can list devices by bus, class, and topology.
 .
 In addition this package ships a configuration file /etc/sysfs.conf which
 allows one to conveniently set sysfs attributes at system bootup (in the init
 script /etc/init.d/sysfsutils).
 .
 If you need sysfs queries in own programs, then you may want to use the
 libsysfs library directly (package libsysfs-dev).
