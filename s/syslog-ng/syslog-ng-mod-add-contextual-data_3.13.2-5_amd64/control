Description: Enhanced system logging daemon (add-contextual-data plugin)
 syslog-ng is an enhanced log daemon, supporting a wide range of input
 and output methods: syslog, unstructured text, message queues,
 databases (SQL and NoSQL alike) and more.
 .
 Key features:
 .
  * receive and send RFC3164 and RFC5424 style syslog messages
  * work with any kind of unstructured data
  * receive and send JSON formatted messages
  * classify and structure logs with builtin parsers (csv-parser(),
    db-parser(), etc.)
  * normalize, crunch and process logs as they flow through the system
  * hand on messages for further processing using message queues (like
    AMQP), files or databases (like PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
 .
 This package provides the add-contextual-data module for syslog-ng.
 With this module syslog-ng can use an external database file to
 append custom name-value pairs on incoming logs (to enrich messages).
 The database is a file that containing `<selector, name, value>` records.
 Currently only `CSV` format is supported. It is like `geoip parser`
 where the selector is `$HOST`, but the user can define
 the selector, and also the database contents.
