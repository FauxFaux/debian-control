Description: syslog routines for OCaml (development files)
 This library provides syslog client functions for OCaml programs.
 These functions are implemented almost entirely in OCaml, not as
 bindings to the standard C library.
 .
 This package contains the files needed to compile OCaml programs
 that use the syslog library.
