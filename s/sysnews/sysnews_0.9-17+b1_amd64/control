Description: program to display system news
 The news command keeps you informed of news concerning the system.
 Each news item is contained in a separate file in the /var/lib/sysnews
 directory. Anyone having write permission to this directory can create
 a news file.
 .
 NOTE: This command has nothing to do with USENET news. It's more like an
 enhanced motd.
