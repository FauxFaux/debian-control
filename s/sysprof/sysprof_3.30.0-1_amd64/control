Description: system-wide Linux profiler
 Sysprof is a sampling CPU profiler that uses a ptrace in Linux kernel to
 profile the entire system, not just a single application. Sysprof handles
 shared libraries and applications do not need to be recompiled. In fact they
 don't even have to be restarted.
 .
 It has the following features:
  - profiles all running processes, not just a single application
  - has a simple graphical interface
  - shows the time spent in each branch of the call tree
  - profiles can be loaded and saved
