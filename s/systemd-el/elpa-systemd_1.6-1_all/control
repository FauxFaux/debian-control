Description: major mode for editing systemd units
 This package provides an Emacs major mode for editing systemd units.
 .
 It is similar to `conf-mode' but with enhanced highlighting; e.g. for
 specifiers and booleans. It employs strict regex for whitespace.
 Features a facility for browsing documentation: use C-c C-o to open
 links to documentation in a unit (cf. systemctl help).
 .
 It supports completion of directives and sections in either units or
 network configuration. Both a completer for
 `completion-at-point-functions' and a company backend are provided.
 The latter can be enabled by adding `company-mode' to
 `systemd-mode-hook'.
