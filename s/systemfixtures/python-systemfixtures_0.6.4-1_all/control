Description: Test fixtures providing fake versions of various system resources
 A collection of Python fixtures to fake out  various system resources such
 as processes, users, groups, etc.
 .
 Each fake resource typically behaves as an "overlay" on the real resource, in
 that it can be programmed with fake behavior for a set of inputs, but falls
 back to the real behavior for the rest.
