Description: Notifies about Linux Software RAID changes in system tray
 systray-mdstat is a system tray icon indicating the state of local
 Linux Software RAIDs (as set up with mdadm) by checking /proc/mdstat
 for changes — especially failures — periodically.
 .
 The use case for this utility is a desktop or laptop with a software
 RAID setup and no remote monitoring of the RAID (e.g. for privacy
 reasons or due to lacking a permanent network connection or an
 appropriate monitoring server).
