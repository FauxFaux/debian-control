Description: daemon to log boot messages
 bootlogd logs all messages printed to the system console during system boot,
 and records those messages to a logfile.
 .
 Note that not all init systems print messages to the system console,
 so that the logfile may remain empty; this is the case with systemd
 (the default init system). Try "journalctl -b" instead.
