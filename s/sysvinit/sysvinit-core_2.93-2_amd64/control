Description: System-V-like init utilities
 This package contains programs required for booting
 a Debian system and doing basic process management.
 .
 The most important program in the package is /sbin/init.
 It is the first process started on boot and continues
 to run as process number 1 until the system halts. All
 other processes are descended from it.
