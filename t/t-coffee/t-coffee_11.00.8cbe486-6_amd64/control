Description: Multiple Sequence Alignment
 T-Coffee is a multiple sequence alignment package. Given a set of
 sequences (Proteins or DNA), T-Coffee generates a multiple sequence
 alignment. Version 2.00 and higher can mix sequences and structures.
 .
 T-Coffee allows the combination of a collection of multiple/pairwise,
 global or local alignments into a single model. It can also
 estimate the level of consistency of each position within the new
 alignment with the rest of the alignments. See the pre-print for more
 information
 .
 T-Coffee has a special called M-Coffee that makes it possible to combine the
 output of many multiple sequence alignment packages. In its published version,
 it uses MUSCLE, PROBCONS, POA, DiAlign-TS, MAFFT, Clustal W, PCMA and
 T-Coffee.  A special version has been made for Debian, DM-Coffee, that uses
 only free software by replacing Clustal W by Kalign. Using the 8 Methods of
 M-Coffee can sometimes be a bit heavy. You can use a subset of your favorite
 methods if you prefer.
