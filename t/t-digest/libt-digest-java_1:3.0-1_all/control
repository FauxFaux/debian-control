Description: Data structure for quantiles and related rank statistics
 The t-digest construction algorithm uses a variant of 1-dimensional
 k-means clustering to product a data structure that is related to the
 Q-digest. This t-digest data structure can be used to estimate
 quantiles or compute other rank statistics. The advantage of the
 t-digest over the Q-digest is that the t-digest can handle floating
 point values while the Q-digest is limited to integers. With small
 changes, the t-digest can handle any values from any ordered set that
 has something akin to a mean. The accuracy of quantile estimates
 produced by t-digests can be orders of magnitude more accurate than
 those produced by Q-digests in spite of the fact that t-digests are
 more compact when stored on disk.
