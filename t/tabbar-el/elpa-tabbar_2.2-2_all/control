Description: Emacs minor mode that displays a tab bar at the top
 This library provides the Tabbar global minor mode which displays a
 tab bar in the header line of Emacs.  Click on a tab to select it.
 Three buttons are displayed on the left side of the tab bar in
 this order: "home", "scroll left", and "scroll right" buttons.  The
 "home" button is used to change something on the tab bar.  The scroll
 left and scroll right buttons are used to scroll tabs horizontally.
 Tabs can be grouped to maintain several sets of tabs at the same
 time.  Only one group is displayed on the tab bar, and the "home"
 button is used to switch between the tab bar groups.
 .
 While the mouse is usually the preferred way to work with the tab
 bar, it is also keyboard-accessible.
