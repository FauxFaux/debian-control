Description: program launcher with tabs for X
 tabble is a small alternative X shell which presents your programs in
 tabs for easy launch. It is not meant to replace a window manager,
 just complement it. Light window managers benefit the most from
 tabble. The idea is that tabble is 'always on top' so multiple
 launches can be made without re-navigating a menu hierarchy or
 clearing the desktop.
