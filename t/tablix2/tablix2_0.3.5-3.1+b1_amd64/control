Description: Kernel for solving general timetabling problems
 Tablix is a powerful free software kernel for solving general
 timetabling problems. It uses a coarse-grained parallel genetic
 algorithm in combination with other techniques to construct
 sensible timetables from XML formatted problem descriptions.
 Tablix can run on a single host as well as on a heterogeneous
 parallel virtual machine using PVM3.
