Description: Parallel/Multiprocessor Ray Tracing Library - runtime - MT flavour
 Tachyon is a portable, high performance parallel ray tracing system
 supporting MPI and multithreaded implementations. Tachyon is built as
 a C callable library, which can be used within applications.
 .
 Tachyon implements all of the basic geometric primitives such as
 triangles, planes, spheres, cylinders, etc. Some of the goals in
 developing Tachyon were to make it fast and for it to parallelize
 well. These are what set it apart from more full-featured programs
 like POV-Ray, Rayshade, and others. Tachyon supports enough features
 to be an excellent alternative to slower programs for demanding
 animation and scientific visualization tasks.
 .
 This package provides the shared library required to run third party
 program compiled against the tachyon C library built with multithreading.
 To compile your own programs you also need to install the concomitant
 libtachyon-mt-0-dev package.
