Description: API Documentation for TagSoup
 Documentation for TagSoup, a SAX-compliant parser written in Java that instead
 of parsing well-formed or valid XML, parses HTML as it is found in the wild:
 poor, nasty and brutish, though quite often far from short. TagSoup is designed
 for people who have to process this stuff using some semblance of a
 rational application design.
