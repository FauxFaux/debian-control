Description: Perl bindings for taktuk
 TakTuk allows one to execute commands in parallel on a potentially large set
 of remote nodes (using ssh to connect to each node). It is typically used
 inside high performance computing clusters and grids. It uses an adaptive
 algorithm to efficiently distribute the work and sets up an interconnection
 network to transport commands and perform I/Os multiplexing. It doesn't
 require any specific software on the nodes thanks to a self-propagation
 algorithm.
 .
 This package provides perl bindings to the TakTuk API. It also provides
 TakTuk::Pilot, a perl module that allows one to manage a TakTuk instance from
 a perl program.
