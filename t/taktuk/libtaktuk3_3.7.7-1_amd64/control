Description: C bindings for taktuk
 TakTuk allows one to execute commands in parallel on a potentially large set
 of remote nodes (using ssh to connect to each node). It is typically used
 inside high performance computing clusters and grids. It uses an adaptive
 algorithm to efficiently distribute the work and sets up an interconnection
 network to transport commands and perform I/Os multiplexing. It doesn't
 require any specific software on the nodes thanks to a self-propagation
 algorithm.
 .
 This package provides libtaktuk3, the C bindings for the taktuk communication
 layer.
