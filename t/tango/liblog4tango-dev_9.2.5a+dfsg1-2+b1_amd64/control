Description: logging for TANGO - development library
 Log for TANGO is a library of C++ classes for flexible logging to files,
 syslog and other destinations. It is modeled after the Log for
 C++ library (http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/), staying as close to
 their API as is reasonable.
 .
 This package contains the log4tango5 development files.
