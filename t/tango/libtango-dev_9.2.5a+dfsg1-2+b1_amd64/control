Description: TANGO distributed control system - development library
 TANGO is an object-oriented distributed control system using CORBA. In
 TANGO all objects are representations of devices, which can be on the
 same computer or distributed over a network. Communication between
 devices uses CORBA and can be synchronous, asynchronous or event driven.
 .
 The object model in TANGO supports methods, attributes and properties.
 TANGO provides an API which hides all the details of network access and
 provides object browsing, discovery, and security features. Permanent
 data is stored in a MySQL/MariaDB database.
 .
 TANGO is being actively developed as a collaborative effort between the
 ESRF (www.esrf.eu), Soleil (synchrotron-soleil.fr), Alba (www.cells.es),
 and Elettra institutes (www.elettra.trieste.it).
 .
 This package contains the tango9 development files.
