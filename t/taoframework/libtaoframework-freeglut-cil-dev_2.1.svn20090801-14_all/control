Description: Tao CLI binding for freeglut - development files
 The Tao Framework is a collection of bindings and libraries to
 facilitate cross-platform games-related development utilizing the Mono
 and .NET platforms.
 .
 freeglut is a completely OpenSourced alternative to the OpenGL Utility
 Toolkit (GLUT) library. GLUT (and hence freeglut) allows the user to
 create and manage windows containing OpenGL contexts on a wide range of
 platforms and also read the mouse, keyboard and joystick functions.
 .
 This package contains development files for Tao.FreeGlut, and should be
 used for compilation.
