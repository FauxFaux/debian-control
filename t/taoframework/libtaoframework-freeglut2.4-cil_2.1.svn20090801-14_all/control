Description: Tao CLI binding for freeglut
 The Tao Framework is a collection of bindings and libraries to
 facilitate cross-platform games-related development utilizing the Mono

 create and manage windows containing OpenGL contexts on a wide range of
 platforms and also read the mouse, keyboard and joystick functions.
