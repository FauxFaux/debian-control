Description: Tao CLI binding for OpenAL - development files
 The Tao Framework is a collection of bindings and libraries to
 facilitate cross-platform games-related development utilizing the Mono
 and .NET platforms.
 .
 OpenAL, the Open Audio Library, is a joint effort to create an open,
 vendor-neutral, cross-platform API for interactive, primarily spatialized
 audio. OpenAL's primary audience are application developers and desktop
 users that rely on portable standards like OpenGL, for games and other
 multimedia applications.
 .
 This package contains development files for Tao.OpenAl and should be used
 for compilation.
