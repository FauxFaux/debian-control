Description: Tao CLI binding for OpenGL and GLU - development files
 The Tao Framework is a collection of bindings and libraries to
 facilitate cross-platform games-related development utilizing the Mono
 and .NET platforms.
 .
 OpenGL is a vendor-neutral, multi-platform standard for high performance
 2D/3D graphics on devices ranging from mobile phones to PCs to
 Supercomputers.
 GLU is the OpenGL Utility Library. This is a set of functions to create
 texture mipmaps from a base image, map coordinates between screen and
 object space, and draw quadric surfaces and NURBS.
 .
 This package contains development files for Tao.OpenGl, and should be used
 for compilation.
