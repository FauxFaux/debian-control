Description: Tarball comparison tool
 TarDiff compares the contents of two tarballs and reports on any
 differences found between them. Its use is mainly for release
 managers who can use it as a QA tool to make sure no files have
 accidentally been left over or were added by mistake. TarDiff
 supports compressed tarballs, diff statistics and suppression of GNU
 autotool changes.
