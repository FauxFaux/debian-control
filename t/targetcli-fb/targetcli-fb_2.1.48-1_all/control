Description: Command shell for managing the Linux LIO kernel target
 The targetcli-fb package is a command-line interface for configuring
 the LIO generic SCSI target, present in 3.x Linux kernel versions.
 .
 The targetcli-fb package is a fork of the "targetcli" code written by
 RisingTide Systems. The "-fb" differentiates between the original and
 this version. Please ensure to use either all "fb" versions of the
 targetcli components -- targetcli, rtslib, and configshell, or stick
 with all non-fb versions, since they are no longer strictly
 compatible.
