Description: Tuning and Analysis Utilities - Tcl/tk profiler GUI
 TAU is a profiling toolkit specially made for parallel computing
 (multi-thread, multi-process, MPI, PVM).
 .
 RACY (Routine and data ACces profile displaY) is a GUI that
 graphically visualizes profiling data.
 .
 RACY has been superceded by a set of Java tools, and is no more
 actively developed.  Unfortunately, those tools cannot build yet
 using free tools.
