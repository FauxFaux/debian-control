Description: "Signal" extension for Tcl
 This extension adds dynamically loadable signal handling to Tcl/Tk
 scripts. It provides a very limited subset of the functionality of tclX (just
 the signal part, and about 3/4 of the functions for signals), but as a result
 is quite small and quick to load.
