Description: Lisp-like macro system for Tcl
 Sugar is a macro system for the Tcl programming language, with a design
 very similar to Lisp macros. It provides a way to create Tcl procedures
 using the [sugar::proc] command instead of the normal Tcl [proc] command,
 and a way to define macros that are expanded inline when the procedure is
 created.
