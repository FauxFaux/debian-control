Description: Tcl data transformations - development files
 Trf is an extension to Tcl which provides various data
 transformations. The collection of provided transformation
 procedures includes:
  * generation of message digests (hash values, checksums): MD2,
    MD5, SHA/SHS, SHA-1, HAVAL, RIPEMD-128, -160, CRC (polynomial
    used by PGP), Adler (based upon zlib);
  * conversion to and from various data encodings: uuencoding,
    base64-encoding, or ASCII85-encoding, and binary, octal, or
    hexadecimal representation;
  * an error-correcting Reed-Solomon encoder/decoder;
  * compression/decompression based on zlib and libbz2.
 .
 This package contains files to be used for development of C-based
 extensions which use the Trf library.
