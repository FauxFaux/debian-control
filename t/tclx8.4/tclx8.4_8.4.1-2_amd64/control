Description: Extended Tcl (TclX) - shared library
 Extended Tcl (TclX), is a set of extensions to Tcl, the Tool Command
 Language invented by Dr. John Ousterhout.  Tcl is a powerful, yet simple
 embeddable programming language.  Extended Tcl is oriented towards system
 programming tasks and large application development.
 .
 TclX provides additional interfaces to the operating system, and adds many
 new programming constructs, text manipulation tools, and debugging tools.
 .
 TclX 8.4 differs from its predecessors in that it is based more on the
 idea of TclX as an extension to Tcl, and not an alternate environment.
 There is no TkX and no stand-alone shells are built. The tkx*8.4 packages
 therefore don't exist anymore.
 .
 This package includes the shared library and Tcl library files.
