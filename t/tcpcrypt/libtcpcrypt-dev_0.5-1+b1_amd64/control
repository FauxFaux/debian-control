Description: Library to retrieve the tcpcrypt session ID where available
 Tcpcrypt offers opportunistic security for TCP network traffic.  All
 traffic between two tcpcrypt-enabled peers will be encrypted to
 protect against passive monitoring.  tcpcrypt also exposes a strong
 session identifier to tcpcrypt-aware clients, which can be used as a
 hook for authentication.
 .
 This package contains header files and directives for building tools
 that use libtcpcrypt.
