Description: Incoming and Outgoing TCP/IP connections logger
 tcpspy is an administrator's tool that logs information
 about incoming and outgoing TCP/IP connections. It's
 written in C and uses no libpcap functions, unlike tcpdump.
 .
 Connections are selected for logging with rules, similarly
 to the filter expressions accepted by tcpdump. The
 following information is logged: username, local address
 and port, remote address and port, and, optionally, the
 executable filename.
 .
 This Debian version supports IPv4 and IPv6.
