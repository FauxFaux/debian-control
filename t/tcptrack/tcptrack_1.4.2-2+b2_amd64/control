Description: TCP connection tracker, with states and speeds
 tcptrack is a sniffer which displays information about TCP connections
 it sees on a network interface. It passively watches for connections
 on the network interface, keeps track of their state and displays a
 list of connections in a manner similar to the unix 'top' command. It
 displays  source and destination addresses and ports, connection
 state, idle time, and bandwidth usage.
