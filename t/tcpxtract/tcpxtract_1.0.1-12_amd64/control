Description: extract files from network traffic based on file signatures
 tcpxtract is a fast console tool to extract files from network traffic
 based on file headers and footers and its patterns (so called carving).
 .
 Currently, 26 file formats are supported out of the box by tcpxtract but
 new formats can be added without problems. Foremost configurations are
 simple to convert to tcpxtract configuration files.
 .
 tcpxtract uses libpcap. So, it can read network dumps generated by tcpdump
 or wireshark or similar programs. tcpxtract is useful in network auditing
 and for forensics investigations.
