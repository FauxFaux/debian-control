Description: fast XML/DOM/XPath/XSLT/HTML/JSON extension for Tcl written in C
 tDOM takes advantage of Expat, the XML parser from James Clark,
 including namespace and DTD support. It includes a modified version
 of Tclexpat, the Tcl interface to Expat, with event-based XML push (SAX-like)
 and pull (StAX-like) parsing. tDOM comes with a (partial) DOM-I and DOM-II
 implementation in C for maximum performance and minimum memory need. A very
 complete, compliant, and fast XPath implementation is provided. A fast XSLT
 implementation in C completes the basic feature set. tDOM interfaces with the
 gumbo HTML5 parser and provides a robust JSON parser/ serializer for
 JSON-to-JSON roundtripping. Documentation is provided in TMML, HTML and
 nroff formats.
