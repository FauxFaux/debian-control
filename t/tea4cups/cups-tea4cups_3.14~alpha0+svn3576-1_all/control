Description: Swiss Army's knife of advanced CUPS administrators
 Tea4CUPS is a CUPS backend wrapper which can capture print datas before they
 are sent to a printer and process, duplicate or dispatch them in a number of
 ways.
 .
 Tea4CUPS is the Swiss Army's knife of the advanced CUPS administrator, and
 can easily replace or extend most of the existing specialized CUPS backends
 (pdf, email, ftp, etc...).
 .
 You are greatly encouraged to use this software instead of writing your own
 CUPS backends: Tea4CUPS will let you plug your own scripts, filters, tools,
 or commands wherever you want, while giving them access to all the print
 job's characteristics in a consistent way.
 .
 Tea4CUPS makes all information about the current print job, in particular the
 job's datas and attributes, available to your own commands through environment
 variables.
 .
 The possibilities are endless:
 .
   - Your own commands can optionally decide to discard the current print job
     instead of printing it.
   - Send the same job to several printers at the same time, which is not
     possible with CUPS.
   - Automate the PDF archiving of all print jobs.
   - Forbid duplicate print jobs (a simple example is shown in the sample
     configuration file).
   - Easily create a print accounting solution.
