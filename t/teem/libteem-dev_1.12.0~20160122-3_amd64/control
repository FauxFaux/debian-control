Description: Tools to process and visualize scientific data and images - development
 Teem is a coordinated group of libraries for representing, processing, and
 visualizing scientific raster data. Teem includes command-line tools that
 permit the library functions to be quickly applied to files and streams,
 without having to write any code. The most important and useful libraries in
 Teem are:
 .
  * Nrrd (and the unu command-line tool on top of it) supports a range of
    operations for transforming N-dimensional raster data (resample, crop,
    slice, project, histogram, etc.), as  well as the NRRD file format for
    storing arrays and their meta-information.
  * Gage: fast convolution-based measurements at arbitrary point locations in
    volume datasets (scalar, vector, tensor, etc.)
  * Mite: a multi-threaded ray-casting volume render with transfer functions
    based on any quantity Gage can measure
  * Ten: for estimating, processing, and visualizing diffusion tensor fields,
    including fiber tractography methods.
 .
 This package provides the Teem header files required to compile C++ programs
 that use Teem to do 3D visualisation.
