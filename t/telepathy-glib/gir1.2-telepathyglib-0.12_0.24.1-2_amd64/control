Description: GLib Telepathy connection manager library (GObject-Introspection)
 This package contains introspection data for telepathy-glib, which can be used
 to generate dynamic bindings for Telepathy components.
 .
 These GObject-Introspection bindings are considered to be experimental by the
 maintainers of telepathy-glib, and might receive incompatible changes until
 at least telepathy-glib 0.14.0.
 .
 Telepathy is a D-Bus framework for unifying real time communication,
 including instant messaging, voice calls and video calls. It abstracts
 differences between protocols to provide a unified interface for
 applications.
