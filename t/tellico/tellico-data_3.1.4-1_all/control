 Tellico is a collection manager for KDE. It includes default collections for
 books, bibliographies, comic books, videos, music, coins, stamps, trading
 cards, and wines.
 .
 Tellico capabilities include:
 .
   * creation of user-defined custom collections with unlimited fields,
   * automatically formatted names,
   * sorting and filtering by any field or property,
   * ISBN validation,
   * full customization for printing or display through XSLT files,
   * import and export of CSV, RIS, BibTeX and BibTeXML files,
   * import data from Amazon, IMDb, CDDB or any US-MARC compliant z39.50 server.

 Tellico files are stored in XML format, avoiding the need for a database
 server, and allowing other software applications to use the data.
