Description: demonstrate electromagnetic emissions from computer systems
 Tempest for Eliza uses a computer monitor to send out AM radio signals.
 This transmission can then be played as audio via a radio.
 .
 All electronic devices send out electromagnetic waves, monitors included,
 at frequencies high enough for a short-wave AM radio.
 .
 Tempest for Eliza displays pictures on a computer screen, one for each
 note in the song.
