Description: layered template library for Python
 Templayer currently supports only HTML generation, but its simple design
 is easily extended to support other file formats.
 .
 Templayer was created to offer an alternative to the more common ways
 of generating dynamic HTML: embedding code within the HTML (PHP etc.),
 or embedding HTML within code (traditional CGI). Neither of these
 methods allow for a clean separation of the form, or layout, of a page
 and the function of page generation. Instead of mixing HTML and Python,
 two rich and extremely expressive languages, we can add a small amount
 of syntax to each and keep the two separate and coherent.
