Description: Tendermint logging toolkit
 Package log15 provides an opinionated, simple toolkit for
 best-practice logging in Go (golang) that is both human
 and machine readable. It is modeled after the Go standard
 library's io and net/http packages and is an alternative
 to the standard library's log package.
 .
 Features
  - A simple, easy-to-understand API.
  - Promotes structured logging by encouraging use of
    key/value pairs.
  - Child loggers which inherit and add their own private context.
  - Lazy evaluation of expensive operations.
  - Simple Handler interface allowing for construction of flexible,
    custom logging configurations with a tiny API.
  - Color terminal support.
  - Built-in support for logging to files, streams, syslog, and
    the network.
  - Support for forking records to multiple handlers, buffering
    records for output, failing over from failed handler writes.
