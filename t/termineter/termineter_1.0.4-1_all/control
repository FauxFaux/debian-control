Description: Smart meter testing framework
 This package contains a Python framework which provides a platform for the
 security testing of smart meters.  It implements the C1218 and C1219 protocols
 for communication over an optical interface.  Currently supported are Meters
 using C1219-2007 with 7-bit character sets.  This is the most common
 configuration found in North America.  Termineter communicates with Smart
 Meters via a connection using an ANSI type-2 optical probe with a serial
 interface.
