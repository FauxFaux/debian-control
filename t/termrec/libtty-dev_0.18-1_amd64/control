Description: terminal/ttyrec library -- development
 libtty is a library for handling terminal output.  It is kind of "reverse
 curses" -- it is on the receiving end of tty data, accepting vt100 codes
 and managing a virtual terminal.  It lacks input handling thus is unfit
 for a real terminal emulator, but includes functions for storing a history
 of frames to handle a "video" recording.
 .
 A second part of the library provides ways to read/write/edit ttyrec/-like
 files, including transparent compression or streaming them from network.
 .
 This package contains the library headers.
