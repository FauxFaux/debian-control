Description: terminal videos/scripts recorder and player
 This package contains "termrec", a program which can record a terminal
 session and "termplay" to play it back.  They can handle both line-based
 programs and full-screen things that use curses or curses-like methods.
 Unlike "ttyrec" or "asciinema", termrec can go back, use .gz/.bz2/.xz/.zst
 transparently, and read/write/convert several formats.
