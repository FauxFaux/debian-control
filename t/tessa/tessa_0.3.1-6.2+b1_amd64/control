Description: simulation of 3D optical systems with the FDTD method
 Tessa is a three-dimensional simulation software for optical systems at
 the wavelength scale, based on the finite differences time-domain method
 (FDTD). It focuses on simulating large, resonating structures, but can
 also be used to study propagating beams. It can simulate arbitrary
 dielectric and absorbing materials, and can be used on single
 workstations as well as clusters.
 .
 Tessa is believed to be terribly efficient.
