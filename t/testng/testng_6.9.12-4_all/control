Description: testing framework for Java
 TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing
 some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use, such as:
  * Annotations.
  * Run your tests in arbitrarily big thread pools with various policies
    available (all methods in their own thread, one thread per test class, etc.)
  * Test that your code is multithread safe.
  * Flexible test configuration.
  * Support for data-driven testing (with @DataProvider).
  * Support for parameters.
  * Powerful execution model (no more TestSuite).
  * Supported by a variety of tools and plug-ins (Eclipse, IDEA, Maven, etc.)
  * Embeds BeanShell for further flexibility.
  * Default JDK functions for runtime and logging (no dependencies).
  * Dependent methods for application server testing.
 TestNG is designed to cover all categories of tests:
 unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc.
