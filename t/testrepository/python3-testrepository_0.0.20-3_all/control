Description: Database of test results - Python 3.x library
 Testrepository provides a database of test results and supports easy workflows
 to be built on top of that database. For instance, running just failing tests
 or getting the last test run back to examine again (without running the tests
 again). Testrepository is compatible with any test suite that can output
 subunit. This includes any TAP test suite and any pyunit compatible test
 suite.
 .
 The python3-testrepository package contains the Python testrepository
 library for Python 3.x, which can be used for programmatic access to the
 database.
