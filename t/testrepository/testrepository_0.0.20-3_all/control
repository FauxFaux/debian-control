Description: unit test system with database of test results - metapackage and doc
 Testrepository provides a database of test results and supports easy workflows

 or getting the last test run back to examine again (without running the tests
 again). Testrepository is compatible with any test suite that can output
 subunit. This includes any TAP test suite and any pyunit compatible test
 suite.

 This package is a metapackage that depends on both Python 2 and 3 packages. It
 also contains the documentation.
