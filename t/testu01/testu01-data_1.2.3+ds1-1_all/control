Description: testing suite for uniform random number generators -- data
 TestU01 is a software library, implemented in the ANSI C language, and
 offering a collection of utilities for the empirical statistical testing
 of uniform random number generators.
 .
 TestU01 implements several types of random number generators in generic
 form, as well as many specific generators proposed in the literature or
 found in widely-used software. It provides general implementations of the
 classical statistical tests for random number generators, as well as several
 others proposed in the literature, and some original ones. These tests can
 be applied to the generators predefined in the library and to user-defined
 generators. Specific tests suites for either sequences of uniform random
 numbers in [0,1] or bit sequences are also provided, as well as basic tools
 for plotting vectors of points produced by generators and more advanced
 tools for more involved tests and usage.
 .
 This package provides the essential TestU01 architecture independent
 material, namely shared data.
