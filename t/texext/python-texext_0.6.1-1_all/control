Description: sphinx extensions for working with LaTeX math - Python 2
 texext contains a couple of Sphinx extensions for working with LaTeX math:
 .
  * math_dollar, replaces math expressions between dollars in ReST with
    equivalent inline math.
 .
  * users of sympy may want to generate LaTeX expressions dynamically in Sympy,
    and then render them in LaTeX in the built pages. You can do this with the
    mathcode directive.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2 version of texext.
