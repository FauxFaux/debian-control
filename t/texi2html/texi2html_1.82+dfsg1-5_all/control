Description: Convert Texinfo files to HTML
 texi2html is a Perl script that converts Texinfo files to HTML.
 .
 The program takes Texinfo files (not info ones) and produces a set of
 HTML files.  The quality of the output is close to the printed output
 and is much better than an info->HTML gateway.
 .
 Compared to the output of `makeinfo --html', texi2html's output is
 more customizable and (subjectively) produces better output by default.
