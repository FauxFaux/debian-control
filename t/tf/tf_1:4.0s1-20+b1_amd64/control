Description: Tinyfugue MUD client for TinyMUDs, DikuMUDs, and LPMUDs
 TinyFugue (also known as "Fugue" or "TF") is a line-based client
 designed for connecting to MUD servers (note: LP, Diku, and other
 servers which use prompts require "/lp on"; see /help prompts).
 .
 TinyFugue is larger than most MUD clients, but has many more features
 and is much more flexible. The goal is to provide the most
 functionality in a client that still maintains the user-friendliness
 of Tinytalk.
