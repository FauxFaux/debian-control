Description: text-based MU* and chatserver client
 TinyFugue is a text-based, line-based client designed for connecting to
 most flavors of MU* servers (TinyMUSH, TinyMUX, LP, Diku, etc.) or any
 telnet-based chatserver.  It includes support for 256-color terminals,
 MCCP versions 1 and 2, a powerful trigger and scripting language, and
 many other features.  Encryption of communications with SSL/TLS is
 supported, but not validation of certificates.  Unicode is not currently
 supported.

 This package is the current development version of TinyFugue (major
 version 5).  For the current stable version (major version 4), install
 the "tf" package instead.
