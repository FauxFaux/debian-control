Description: Reference Manual for The Hessling Editor
 The Hessling Editor was originally written to be used by people already
 familiar with the VM/CMS System Product Editor XEDIT and KEDIT from
 Mansfield Software. For this reason, THE Reference Manual provides
 limited information on using THE, and concentrates more on reference
 material, such as command syntax and configuration.
