Description: CPU/GPU math expression compiler for Python (docs)
 Theano is a Python library that allows one to define and evaluate mathematical
 expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. It provides a
 high-level Numpy like expression language for functional description of
 calculation, rearranges expressions for speed and stability, and generates
 native machine instructions for fast calculation. Optionally, highly
 accelerated computations could be carried out on graphics cards processors.
 .
 This package contains the documentation for Theano.
