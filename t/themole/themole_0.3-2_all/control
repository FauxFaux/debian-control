Description: automatic SQL injection exploitation tool
 The Mole is an automatic SQL Injection exploitation tool.
 Only by providing a vulnerable URL and a valid string on the
 site it can detect the injection and exploit it, either by
 using the union technique or a boolean query based technique.
 .
 The Mole uses a command based interface, allowing the user
 to indicate the action he wants to perform easily. The CLI also
 provides auto-completion on both commands and command arguments,
 making the user type as less as possible.
