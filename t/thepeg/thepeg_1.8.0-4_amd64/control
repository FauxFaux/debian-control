Description: Toolkit for High Energy Physics Event Generation
 ThePEG is a general toolkit for implementing physics models of event
 generation in high energy particle collisions. It defines a general
 structure of event generation in terms of abstract base classes for e.g.
 hard partonic matrix elements, parton showers and the decay of unstable
 particles. Different models are then implemented by creating classes which
 inherits from these base classes and implements sets of pre-defined virtual
 functions.
 .
 This package provides program files of ThePEG.
