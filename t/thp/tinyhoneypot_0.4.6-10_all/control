Description: Small honeypot to trap attackers
 Small honeypot provides an environment which can be used to lure attackers
 into it. It provides sample responses that simulate a set of services (http,
 pop3, ftp, ssh, mssql and shell) and logs all the connections to these
 services for later auditing.
