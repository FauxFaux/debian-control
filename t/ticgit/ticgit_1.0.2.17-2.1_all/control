Description: ticketing system built on Git
 ticgit is an issue tracking system based in the Git revision control
 system. Tickets are stored in a separate branch called “ticgit” within
 a Git repository that can be made available on a public server along
 with the project’s source code. The idea is to keep tickets close to a
 project without touching its source tree.
