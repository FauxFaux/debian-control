Description: Scripts to run Tiger in other operating systems
 TIGER, or the 'tiger' scripts, is a set of Bourne shell scripts, C programs
 and data files which are used to perform a security audit of different
 operating systems. The tools can be both run altogether once to generate an
 audit report of the system and they can also be run periodically to
 provide information on changes to the system's security once a
 security baseline has been defined. Consequently, they can be used
 also as a host intrusion detection mechanism.
 .
 This package provides all the scripts for operating systems other than Linux
 provided for in the Tiger distribution. It is provided in the hope it will be
 useful for administrators that wish to run tiger in a distributed environment
 sharing these files through the network (e.g. NFS).
