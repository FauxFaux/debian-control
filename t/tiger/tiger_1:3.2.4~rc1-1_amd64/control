Description: Report system security vulnerabilities
 TIGER, or the 'tiger' scripts, is a set of Bourne shell scripts, C programs
 and data files which are used to perform a security audit of different
 operating systems. The tools can be both run altogether once to generate an
 audit report of the system and they can also be run periodically to
 provide information on changes to the system's security once a
 security baseline has been defined. Consequently, they can be used
 also as a host intrusion detection mechanism.
 .
 The tools rely on specialised external security tools such as John the Ripper,
 Chkroot and integrity check tools (like Tripwire, Integrit or Aide) for some
 of the tasks. The periodic review mechanism relies on the use of the cron task
 scheduler and an email delivery system.
 .
 TIGER has one primary goal: report ways the system's security can be
 compromised.
 .
 Debian's TIGER incorporates new checks primarily oriented towards Debian
 distribution including: md5sums checks of installed files, location of files
 not belonging to packages, and analysis of local listening processes.
 .
 This package provides all the security scripts and data files.
