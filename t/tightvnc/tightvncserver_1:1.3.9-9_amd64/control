Description: virtual network computing server software
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 This package provides a server to which X clients can connect and the
 server generates a display that can be viewed with a vncviewer.
 .
 The difference between the tightvncserver and the normal vncserver is the
 data encoding, optimized for low bandwidth connections. If the client do not
 support jpeg or zlib encoding it can use the default one. Later versions of
 vncserver (> 3.3.3r2) support a new automatic encoding that should be equally
 good as the tightvnc encoding.
 .
 Note: This server does not support or need a display. You need a vncviewer to
 see something. However, this viewer may also be on a computer running other
 operating systems in the local net.
