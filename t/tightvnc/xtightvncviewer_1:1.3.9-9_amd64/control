Description: virtual network computing client software for X
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 It is implemented in a client/server model. This package provides a client
 for X, with this you can connect to a vncserver somewhere in the network
 and display its content in a window. There are vncserver available for other
 operating systems.
 .
 The difference between the xtightvncviewer and the normal vncviewer is the
 data encoding, optimized for low bandwidth connections. If the client do not
 support jpeg or zlib encoding it can use the default one. Later versions of
 xvncviewer (> 3.3.3r2) support a new automatic encoding that should be equally
 good as the tightvnc encoding.
