Description: GTK+ based drop down terminal for Linux and Unix
 Tilda is a terminal emulator similar to normal terminals like
 gnome-terminal (GNOME) or Konsole (KDE), with the difference
 that it drops down from the edge of a screen when a certain configurable
 hotkey is pressed. This is similar to the build-in consoles in
 games such as Quake or Half-live. Tilda is highly configureable
 through a graphical wizard.
