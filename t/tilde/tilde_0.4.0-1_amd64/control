Description: Intuitive text editor for the terminal
 Tilde is a text editor for the console/terminal, which provides an intuitive
 interface for people accustomed to GUI environments such as Gnome, KDE
 and Windows. For example, the short-cut to copy the current selection is
 Control-C, and to paste the previously copied text the short-cut Control-V can
 be used. As another example, the File menu can be accessed by pressing Meta-F.
