Description: Block-Sparse Tensor Library (development files)
 TiledArray is a scalable, block-sparse tensor library that is designed
 to aid in rapid composition of high-performance tensor expressions,
 appearing for example in many-body quantum mechanics. It allows users
 to compose tensor expressions of arbitrary complexity that closely
 resembles the standard mathematical notation.
 .
 This package contains the static libraries and the header files.
