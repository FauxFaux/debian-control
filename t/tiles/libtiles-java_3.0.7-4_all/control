Description: Java templating framework for web application user interfaces
 Apache Tiles is a Java templating framework built to simplify the development
 of web application user interfaces. Tiles allows authors to define page
 fragments which can be assembled into a complete page at runtime.
 .
 Tiles grew in popularity as a component of the popular
 Struts <http://struts.apache.org/1.x/> framework.
 .
 It has since been extracted from Struts and is now integrated with various
 frameworks, such as Struts 2 <http://struts.apache.org/2.x/>
 and Shale <http://shale.apache.org/>.
