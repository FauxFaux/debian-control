Description: Tiling terminal emulator for GNOME
 Tilix is a feature-rich tiling terminal emulator following the
 GNOME human interface design guidelines.
 Its many features include:
 .
  * Layout terminals in any fashion by splitting them horizontally or
    vertically.
  * Terminals can be re-arranged using drag and drop both within and
    between windows.
  * Terminals can be detached into a new window via drag and drop.
  * Input can be synchronized between terminals so commands typed in
    one terminal are replicated to the others.
  * Supports notifications when processes are completed out of view.
