Description: JACK audio recorder for spontaneous and conservatory use
 Timemachine writes the last 10 seconds of audio _before_ the button press
 and everything from now on up to the next button press into a WAV-file.
 .
 The idea is that you doodle away with whatever is kicking around in your
 studio and when you heard an interesting noise, you'd press record and
 capture it, without having to try and recreate it.
 .
 It uses the JACK audio connection kit, an API that lets audio application
 communicate with each other and share audio data in realtime.
