Description: simple graphical program for certification authority management
 TinyCA is a program with a simple graphical user interface that makes
 managing a small CA (Certification Authority) easy.  TinyCA works as
 a frontend for openssl and can deal with several independent CAs.
 .
 With TinyCA you can create and manage x509 and S/MIME server and
 client certificates.  You can choose between RSA and DSA keys, as
 well as between different digest algorithms.
 .
 The certificates can be exported as PEM, DER, TXT and PKCS#12 or as a
 convenient archive containing both key and certificate.  Certificates
 can be revoked by adding them to a certificate revocation list.
