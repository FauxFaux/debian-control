Description: A tool to learn recognizing musical intervals
 Tiny Ear Trainer is a tiny piece of software that helps you to recognize
 musical intervals.
 .
 Implemented features include associating colors to intervals and learning mode
 which plays interval together with color and name. Harmonic and melodic
 intervals are supported. It uses fluidsynth/soundfonts for playback. You may
 want to know that GNU Solfege is a far more powerful alternative to Tiny Ear
 Trainer.

 Tiny Ear Trainer works with JACK Audio Connection Kit.
