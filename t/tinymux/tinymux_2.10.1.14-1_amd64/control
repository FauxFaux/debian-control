Description: text-based multi-user virtual world server
 This is the TinyMUX flavor of mud servers of the MUSH branch. It
 provides a number of robust features to enable players to extend
 the virtual world. This is done by building new rooms and objects,
 and utilizing its internal programming language, MUSHcode.
 .
 TinyMUX does not provide a superset of all the features available in
 other MUSH flavors, but those it does implement provide a stable and
 robust environment that performs as well or better than that of its
 peers.
