Description: lightweight and fast WFS-T server
 TinyOWS is a lightweight and fast implementation of the OGC WFS-T
 specification. Web Feature Service (WFS) allows querying and retrieval
 of features. The transactional profile (WFS-T) allows inserting, updating
 or deleting such features.
 .
 From a technical point of view WFS-T is a Web Service API in front
 of a spatial database. TinyOWS is deeply tied to PostgreSQL/PostGIS
 because of this.
 .
 TinyOWS implements strictly OGC standards and pass successfully all
 WFS OGC CITE tests (and even beta ones).
 .
 TinyOWS is part of MapServer Suite, but provided as a distinct module
 (i.e you could use it in conjunction with MapServer and MapCache, or
 as a standalone app). But both MapServer and TinyOWS could use the same
 configuration file, if you want to (or native TinyOWS XML config file).
