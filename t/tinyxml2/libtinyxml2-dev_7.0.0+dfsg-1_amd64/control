Description: TinyXML2 library - header and static library
 This package contains the header file and a static version of the
 TinyXML2 library.
 .
 TinyXML2 is a simple and small C++ XML parser that can be easily integrating
 into other programs. It reads XML and creates C++ objects representing the XML
 document. The objects can be manipulated, changed, and saved again as XML.
 .
 TinyXML2 supersedes the previous TinyXML library, with various improvements:
  - Fewer memory allocations (1% - 10% compared to TinyXML)
  - Uses less memory (about 40% of that used by TinyXML)
  - Faster
  - No STL requirement
  - More modern C++, including a proper namespace
  - Proper and useful handling of whitespace
