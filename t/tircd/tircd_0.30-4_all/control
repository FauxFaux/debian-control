Description: ircd proxy to the twitter API
 tircd presents Twitter as an IRC channel. You can connect to tircd
 with any IRC client, and Twitter as if you were on IRC.
 .
 To update your status on Twitter, send a message to the #twitter
 channel. When users you follow update their status, tircd will be sent
 to the channel as a message from them. Other actions are similarly
 mapped to the equivalent IRC commands and events.
