Description: strike down super high-velocity swooping insects - game data
 Titanion is an abstract shooter game. While you fire with one button, the
 other one acts as a tractor ray to attract the enemies and take them to
 the combat line. The game in itself is quite simple, but with such
 graphics and playability that it's worth a try.

 This package includes the architecture-independent data for the game Titanion.
