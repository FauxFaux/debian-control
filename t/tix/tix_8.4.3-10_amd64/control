Description: library for Tk -- runtime package
 The Tix library for Tk extends Tk with new widgets like:
    o panned windows,
    o hierarchical lists,
    o folders,
    o combo boxes,
    o help balloons,
    o and many others.
 .
 The Tix look and feel is really good. Additionally, Tix eases construction
 of mega-widget and has a full-fledged C interface as well.
