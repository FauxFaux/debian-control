 Japanese, European, and other models). It permits expanded .005 -
 1599.995 MHz frequency coverage (except cellular bands) for memory
 channels and can:
 .
 Read a memory image from an IC-R2 receiver or a disk file.
 Display data from a memory image and let a user change various settings.
 Add descriptive labels to memory channels and banks.
 Sort memory channels by frequency or label.
 Swap pairs of memory banks.
 Import memory channel data from a csv or ICF file.
 Export memory channel data to a csv file.
 Write the results back to the radio.
