Description: flexible listbox widget for Tcl/Tk
 TkTreeCtrl is a multi-column hierarchical listbox widget for the
 Tk GUI toolkit. It can display items that have a parent-child relationship
 with other itemsin a one- or two-dimensional arrangement. Items do also have
 a set of states, which are boolean properties.
 .
 Items may be  spread about one or more columns. For each column of an item
 there is a style associated, which determines how to display the item's
 column taking into account the item's current state set. One column can be
 defined to display the data in a hierarchical structure.
