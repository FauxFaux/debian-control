Description: Python client for tldr: simplified and community-driven man pages
 Yet another Python client for tldr. tldr is a collection of simplified and
 community-driven man pages. Instead of the long man pages, tldr will give you
 several simple yet powerful examples.
 .
 tldr is just a simple version for the man page, it's not an alternative.
 Sometimes, you should read the man pages patiently.
