Description: compare similar files using fuzzy hashing
 The Trend Micro Locality Sensitive Hash is a fuzzy hash algorithm that can be
 used to compare similar but not identical files.
 .
 Identifying near duplicates and similar files is known to be useful to
 identify malware samples with similar binary file structure, variants of spam
 email, or backups with corrupted files.
 .
 This package contains the tlsh_unittest utility, a command-line tool to
 generate TLSH hash values and compare TLSH hash values to determine
 similar files.
