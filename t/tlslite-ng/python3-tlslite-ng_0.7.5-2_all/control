Description: pure Python3 implementation of SSL/TLS protocols
 tlslite-ng is a Python implementation of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
 and TLS (Transport Layer Security) cryptographic protocols for
 providing communication security for computer networks. It supports
 SSLv3, TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 and several ciphersuites.
 .
 tlslite-ng integrates well with several stdlib networking libraries. It aims
 to be a drop-in replacement for TLS lite (which is not in Debian anymore) while
 providing a more comprehensive set of features and more secure defaults.
 .
 Important: if you think about employing tlslite-ng for securing network
 connections please be sure to have read "11. Security Considerations" in the
 README.
 .
 This package provides the modules for Python 3.
