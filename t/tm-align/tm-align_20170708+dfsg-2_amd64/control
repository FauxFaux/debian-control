Description: structural alignment of proteins
 TM-align is a computer algorithm for protein structure alignment using
 dynamic programming. The scoring is performed by the TM-score rotation
 matrix. This is similar to the RMSD in that unaligned portions of the
 structure influence the scoring less than the more structurally conserved
 regions.
