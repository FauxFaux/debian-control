Description: terminal multiplexer with instant terminal sharing
 tmate provides an instant pairing solution, allowing you to share a terminal
 with one or several teammates. Together with a voice call, it's almost like
 pairing in person. The terminal sharing works by using SSH connections to
 backend servers maintained by tmate upstream developers; teammates need to be
 given a randomly-generated token to be able to join a session.
 .
 tmate is a modified version of tmux, and uses the same configurations such as
 keybindings, color schemes etc.
