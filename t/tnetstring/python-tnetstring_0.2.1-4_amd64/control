Description: python library for data serialization using typed netstrings
 Python implementation of the tnetstring serialization format.
 .
 Tnetstring is a lot like JSON but it uses a new syntax called "typed
 netstrings" that was proposed for use in the Mongrel2 webserver. It's
 designed to be simpler and easier to implement than JSON, with a happy
 consequence of also being faster in many cases.
 .
 This Python library provided functions to read and write tnetstrings.
