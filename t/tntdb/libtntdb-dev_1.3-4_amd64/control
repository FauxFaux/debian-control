Description: Development headers for tntdb
 This library provides a thin, database independent layer over an SQL
 database.  It lacks complex features like schema queries or wrapper
 classes like active result sets or data bound controls.  Instead you
 get to access the database directly with SQL queries.  The library is
 suited for application programming, not for writing generic database
 handling tools.
 .
 Currently has support for MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite.
