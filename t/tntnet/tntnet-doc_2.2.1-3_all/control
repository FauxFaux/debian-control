Description: documentation for Tntnet
 Tntnet has a template-language called ecpp similar to PHP, JSP or
 Mason, where you can embed c++ code inside a HTML page to generate
 active content. The ecpp files are precompiled to C++ classes called
 components and compiled and linked into a shared library. This process
 is done at compiletime. The web server Tntnet needs only the compiled
 component library.
 .
 Because the web applications are compiled into native code, they are
 very fast and compact.
 .
 Components can call other components. So you can create building blocks
 of HTML parts and call them in other pages like subprocesses.
 .
 Requests are parsed by tntnet and the request information is easily
 accessible to the components. It supports GET and POST parameters and
 MIME multipart requests for file upload.
 .
 The template language has also support for internationalized
 applications. You can easily create web applications for different
 languages.
 .
 Other features are: cookies, HTTP upload, automatic request parameter
 parsing and conversion, automatic session management, scoped variables
 (application, request and session), internationalisation and keep-alive.
 .
 Logging is done through cxxtools, which provides a unique API for
 log4cpp, log4cxx or simple logging to files or console.
 .
 Tntnet is fully multithreaded and much work has been gone into making
 it scalable. It uses a dynamic pool of worker threads, which answer
 requests from HTTP clients.
