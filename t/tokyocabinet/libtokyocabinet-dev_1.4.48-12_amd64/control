Description: Tokyo Cabinet Database Libraries [development]
 Tokyo Cabinet is an efficient database library like GDBM and NDBM.
 It features hash database and B+ tree database and is developed as the
 successor of QDBM, for the purpose of the following three points: higher
 processing speed, smaller size of a database file, and simpler API.
 .
 This is the development package which contains headers and static libraries
 for the Tokyo Cabinet database library.
