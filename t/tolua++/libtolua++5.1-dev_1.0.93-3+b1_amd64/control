Description: extended tool to integrate C/C++ code with Lua (devel)
 tolua++5.1 is an extension of toLua, a tool to integrate C/C++ code with
 Lua. tolua++5.1 includes new features oriented to c++, such as class
 templates and is compiled with the newest lua 5.1.
 .
 Based on a "cleaned" header file, tolua++ automatically generates
 the binding code to access C/C++ features from Lua. Using Lua-5.1 API and
 metamethod facilities, the current version automatically maps C/C++
 constants, external variables, functions, namespace, classes, and methods
 to Lua. It also provides facilities to create Lua modules.
