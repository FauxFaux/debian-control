Description: analyzer for host agnostic Clojure code
 An analyzer for host agnostic Clojure code, written in Clojure and producing
 AST in EDN.
 The analyzer in this library should not to be used directly as it lacks any
 knowledge about host-specific special forms and it should only be considered
 as a building platform for host-specific analyzers
