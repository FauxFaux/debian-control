Description: Links Pine and GnuPG together
 Topal is yet another program that links GnuPG and Pine/Alpine.  It
 offers facilities to encrypt, decrypt, sign, and verify messages.
 Multiple PGP blocks included in the text of a message are processed.
 Decryption and verification output can be cached to reduce the
 number of times the passphrase is entered.  RFC2015/3156 multipart
 messages can be sent and received with help from some scripts,
 procmail, and a patch to Pine/Alpine.  It includes basic support for
 verifying S/MIME multipart/signed messages.  There is a remote
 sending mode for reading email on a distant computer via SSH with
 secret keys on the local computer.  There is a high level of
 configurability.
