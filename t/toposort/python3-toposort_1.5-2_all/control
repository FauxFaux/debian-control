Description: topological sort algorithm - Python 3 module
 In computer science, a topological sort (sometimes abbreviated
 topsort or toposort) or topological ordering of a directed graph is a
 linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge uv
 from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.
 .
 This package provides this algorithm for Python 3.
