Description: helps download and run the Tor Browser Bundle
 Tor Browser Launcher is intended to make the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) easier
 to maintain and use for GNU/Linux users. torbrowser-launcher handles
 downloading the most recent version of TBB for you, in your language and for
 your architecture. It also adds a "Tor Browser" application launcher to your
 operating system's menu.
 .
 When you first launch Tor Browser Launcher, it will download TBB from
 https://www.torproject.org/ and extract it to ~/.local/share/torbrowser,
 and then execute it.
 Cache and configuration files will be stored in ~/.cache/torbrowser and
 ~/.config/torbrowser.
 Each subsequent execution after installation will simply launch the most
 recent TBB, which is updated using Tor Browser's own update feature.
