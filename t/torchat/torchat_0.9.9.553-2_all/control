Description: decentralized instant messenger built on top of the Tor Network
 TorChat is a peer to peer instant messenger with a completely decentralized
 design, built on top of Tor's location hidden services, providing strong
 anonymity while being very easy to use
 .
 Top most relevant feature TorChat claims, above from text messaging and file
 sending, rest on the difficulty someone would experiment trying to find out
 where you are communicating from
 .
 In the condition someone might be observing you and sniff your internet traffic
 connection, the person will find highly difficult to find out:
  - Where your contacts are located
  - To whom you are sending or receiving from
  - What you send or receive, as everything is end-to-end encrypted
