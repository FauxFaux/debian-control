Description: download and process data from total station devices
 Total Open Station (TOPS for friends) is a free software program
 for downloading and processing data from total station devices.
 .
 This is a task which is usually done by proprietary, dedicated and
 Windowsâ„¢-only software, but TOPS is different by nature, because:
 .
  - it is free software released under the GNU GPLv3 license;
  - it works on any operating system, including mobile platforms like OpenMoko;
  - it is designed to support as many devices and formats as possible,
    all within the same program, opposed to having one program per device.
 .
 Every model has its own quirks, but TOPS uses a modular structure and keeps
 the downloading of data logically separated from its processing, thus enabling
 exporting data to a variety of output formats, even at a later moment.
 Archiving of raw data is made easy by using plain text files.
