Description: proxy to simulate network and system conditions
 Toxiproxy is a framework for simulating network conditions. It's made
 specifically to work in testing, CI and development environments,
 supporting deterministic tampering with connections, but with support
 for randomized chaos and customization. Toxiproxy is the tool you need
 to prove with tests that your application doesn't have single points of failure
 .
 This package contains the server.
