Description: ThinkPad hardware/firmware access modules source - dkms version
 The tp_smapi kernel module exposes some features of the ThinkPad
 hardware/firmware via a sysfs interface. Currently, the main implemented
 functionality is control of battery charging and extended battery status.
 The underlying hardware interfaces are SMAPI and direct access to the
 embedded controller.
 .
 This package also brings the source for an improved version of HDAPS
 which should work on newer ThinkPads too (the stock kernel version does
 not).
 .
 This package contains the source to be built with dkms.
