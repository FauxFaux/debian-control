Description: TPM2 Software stack library - development files
 TPM2.0 TSS (Software Stack) consists of API layers provided to support
 TPM 2.0 chips. It is made out of three layers:
 .
   - Enhanced System API (ESAPI)
   - System API (SAPI), which implements the system layer API;
   - Marshaling/Unmarshaling (MU)
   - TPM Command Transmission Interface (TCTI), which is used by SAPI to
     allow communication with the TAB/RM layer;
 .
 This package contains development files for use when writing applications
 that need access to TPM chips.
