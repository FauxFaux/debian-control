Description: text presentation program
 Tpp stands for text presentation program and is an ncurses-based presentation
 tool. The presentation can be written with your favorite editor in a simple
 description format and then shown on any text terminal that is supported by
 ncurses - ranging from an old VT100 to the Linux framebuffer to an xterm.
 .
 It supports color, LaTeX output of presentation, sliding in text,
 a command prompt and additional cool features.
 .
 The package also installs syntax highlighting modes/add-ons for emacs
 and vim. To enable the vim add-on, the package vim-addon-manager
 needs to be installed, too.
