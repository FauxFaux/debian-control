Description: This is a launcher for people that are nostalgic about katapult
 Trabucco means trebuchet in Italian, which is a siege weapon, like a catapult.
 When KDE4 was released, katapult was replaced by krunner.
 .
 Trabucco aims at providing an experience similar to katapult, using modern
 freedesktop.org standards.
 .
 It shows only one action per search query, and it is very deterministic about
 it.
