Description: enhanced e-mail notification system for Trac
 The AnnouncerPlugin is meant to provide an extensible,
 user-customizable notification system that can be used to
 completely replace Trac's default notifications. It allows
 easy and flexible notifications about tickets, wiki page
 changes, and even Bitten builds.
