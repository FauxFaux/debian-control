Description: continuous integration plugin for Trac
 Bitten is a Trac extension for continuous integration. It uses
 a distributed build model, where one or more "slaves" run the
 actual tests, and a "master" gathers the results and displays
 them nicely on a web page.
 .
 Bitten is similar to BuildBot, Gump, Hudson, Jenkins, or
 Tinderbox, but integrated well into Trac.
 .
 This package contains the slave, which performs the actual build.
 It is recommended to run the slave on behalf of a non-privileged
 user. You may run the slave from e.g. from cron or as a daemon.
