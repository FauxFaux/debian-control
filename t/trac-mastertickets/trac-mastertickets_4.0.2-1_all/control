Description: adds inter-ticket dependencies to Trac
 This Trac plugin adds "blocks" and "blocked by" fields to each
 ticket, enabling you to express dependencies between tickets. It
 also provides a GraphvizPlugin-based dependency-graph feature
 for those tickets having dependencies specified, allowing you to
 visually understand the dependency tree.
