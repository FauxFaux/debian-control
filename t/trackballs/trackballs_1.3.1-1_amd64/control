Description: OpenGL-based game of steering a marble through a labyrinth
 Trackballs is a simple game similar to the classical game Marble Madness
 on the Amiga in the 80's. By steering a marble ball through a labyrinth
 filled with vicious hammers, pools of acid and other obstacles the
 player collects points. When the ball reaches the destination it continues
 at the next, more difficult level - unless the time runs out.
 .
 This game is not intended to be a replica of Marble Madness but rather
 inspired by it. The game is also highly configurable by using a
 scripting extension (Guile) and it provides a simple editor by which new
 levels can easily be created.
