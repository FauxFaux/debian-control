Description: library to handle series of discrete events (development files)
 TrailDB is a highly optimized database library, written in C, which allows you
 to store and query trillions of discrete events quickly. In contrast to many
 other time-series databases, TrailDB focuses on discrete data, like events in
 a log file, which it can compress efficiently using a custom compression
 algorithm.
