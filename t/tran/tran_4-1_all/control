Description: transcribe between character scripts (alphabets)
 This tool lets you transliterate, with a ¼-hearted attempt at transcription,
 both ways between Latin and a number of other writing scripts.  Thus for
 example the word “Debian” is “Дэбян” in Cyrillic or “Δεβιαν” in Greek.
 Conversion to Latin lets you understand foreign text (at least names if not
 meaning), conversion from Latin is for fun, i10n testing, etc.
 .
