Description: find rho-independent transcription terminators in bacterial genomes
 TransTermHP finds rho-independent transcription terminators in
 bacterial genomes. Each terminator found by the program is assigned a
 confidence value that estimates its probability of being a true
 terminator. TransTermHP is the successor of TransTerm which was using
 very different search and scoring algorithms.
