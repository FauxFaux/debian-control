Description: Trapperkeeper service for scheduling background tasks
 Trapperkeeper-scheduler is a Trapperkeeper service that provides a simple API
 for scheduling potentially recurring background tasks. Other Trapperkeeper
 services may specify a dependency on the Scheduler service and then use its
 functions to schedule and cancel jobs to be run on background.
