Description: large-scale eigenvalue algorithms - runtime files
 Anasazi is an extensible and interoperable framework for large-scale
 eigenvalue algorithms. The motivation for this framework is to provide a
 generic interface to a collection of algorithms for solving large-scale
 eigenvalue problems. Anasazi is interoperable because both the matrix and
 vectors (defining the eigenspace) are considered to be opaque objects -- only
 knowledge of the matrix and vectors via elementary operations is necessary.
 .
 This package contains the dynamic libraries.
