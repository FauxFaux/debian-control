Description: generation of distributed linear systems - development files
 The Trilinos package Galeri contains a suite of utilities and classes to
 generate a variety of (distributed) linear systems. Galeri's functionalities
 are very close to that of the MATLAB's gallery() function.
 Several well-known finite element and finite difference matrices can be
 generated using only a few simple code lines.
