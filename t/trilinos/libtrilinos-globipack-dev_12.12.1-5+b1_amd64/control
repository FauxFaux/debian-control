Description: 1D globalization capabilities - development files
 The GlobiPack package contains a set of interfaces and implementations for 1D
 globalization capabilities to be used in nonlinear solvers, optimization
 solvers, and similar algorithms that require globalization methods (e.g. line
 search and trust region methods). Basic interfaces and a few implementations
 are present for 1D line search methods appropritate for Newton, quasi-Newton,
 and nonlinear CG algorithms.
 .
 This package provides headers.
