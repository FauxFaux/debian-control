Description: algebraic preconditioners - development files
 IFPACK provides a suite of object-oriented algebraic preconditioners for the
 solution of preconditioned iterative solvers. IFPACK constructors expect an
 Epetra_RowMatrix object for construction. IFPACK is part of the Trilinos
 Solver Project and IFPACK object interact well with other Trilinos classes. In
 particular, IFPACK can be used as a preconditioner for AztecOO.
