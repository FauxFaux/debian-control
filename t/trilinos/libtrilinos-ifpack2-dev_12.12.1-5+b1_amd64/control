Description: next generation algebraic preconditioners - development files
 Ifpack2 provides incomplete factorizations, relaxations, and domain
 decomposition operators for linear algebra objects (sparse matrices,
 operators, and dense vectors and multivectors) provided by the Tpetra package.
 You may use these operators however you wish: for example as preconditioners
 in an iterative solver, or as smoothers for algebraic multigrid.
 .
 This package provides headers.
