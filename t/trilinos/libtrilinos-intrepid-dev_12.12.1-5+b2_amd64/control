Description: compatible discretizations of PDEs - development files
 Intrepid is a library of interoperable tools for compatible discretizations of
 Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).  Intrepid is intended primarily for
 application developers who want to reuse large parts of their existing code
 frameworks such as I/O, data structures, assembly routines, etc. while gaining
 access to advanced discretization capabilities provided by Intrepid.
