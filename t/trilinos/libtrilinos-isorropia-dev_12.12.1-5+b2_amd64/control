Description: partitioning, load balancing, coloring of sparse matrices - development files
 Isorropia is a package for combinatorial scientific computing, with focus on
 partitioning and load balancing, but also supports coloring and ordering of
 sparse matrices. Its main purpose is to assist with redistributing objects
 such as matrices and graphs in a parallel execution setting, to allow for more
 efficient computations. Isorropia partitions matrices by rows, and produces
 good maps for Epetra matrices (graphs).
