Description: Trilinos Kokkos programming model - development files
 Kokkos implements a programming model in C++ for writing performance portable
 applications targeting all major HPC platforms. For that purpose it provides
 abstractions for both parallel execution of code and data management.
 Kokkos is designed to target complex node architectures with N-level memory
 hierarchies and multiple types of execution resources. It currently can use
 OpenMP, Pthreads and CUDA as backend programming models.
 .
 This package provides headers.
