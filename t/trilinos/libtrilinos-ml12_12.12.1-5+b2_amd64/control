Description: multigrid preconditioning - runtime files
 ML is Sandia's main multigrid preconditioning package. ML is designed to solve
 large sparse linear systems of equations arising primarily from elliptic PDE
 discretizations. ML is used to define and build multigrid solvers and
 preconditioners, and it contains black-box classes to construct
 highly-scalable smoothed aggregation preconditioners. ML preconditioners have
 been used on thousands of processors for a variety of problems, including the
 incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with heat and mass transfer, linear and
 nonlinear elasticity equations, the Maxwell equations, semiconductor
 equations, and more.
 .
 This package contains the dynamic libraries.
