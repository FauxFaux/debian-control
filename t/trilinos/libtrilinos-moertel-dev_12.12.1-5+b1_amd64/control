Description: mortar methods package - development files
 This package supplies capabilities for nonconforming mesh tying and contact
 formulations in 2 and 3 dimensions using Mortar methods. Mortar methods are a
 type of Lagrange Multiplier constraint that can be used in contact
 formulations and in non-conforming or conforming mesh tying as well as in
 domain decomposition techniques. Originally introduced as a domain
 decomposition method for spectral elements, Mortar methods are used in a large
 class of nonconforming situations such as the surface coupling of different
 physical models, discretization schemes or non-matching triangulations along
 interior interfaces of a domain.
