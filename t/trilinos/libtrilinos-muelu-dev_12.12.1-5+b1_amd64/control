Description: next generation multilevel preconditioner capabilities - development files
 MueLu is designed to solve large sparse linear systems of equations arising
 from PDE discretizations. MueLu provides easy-to-use multigrid solvers and
 preconditioners based on smoothed aggregation algorithms. As a multigrid
 framework, MueLu supports the design of highly application specific multigrid
 preconditioners.
