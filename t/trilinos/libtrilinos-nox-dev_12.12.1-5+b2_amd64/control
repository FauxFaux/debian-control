Description: robust solution of nonlinear equations - development files
 NOX robustly solves and analyzes large-scale systems of nonlinear equations.
 NOX is short for Nonlinear Object-Oriented Solutions, and its objective is to
 enable the robust and efficient solution of the equation: F(x)=0 using
 globalized Newton methods such as line search and trust region methods. NOX is
 designed to work with any linear algebra package and to be easily customized.
