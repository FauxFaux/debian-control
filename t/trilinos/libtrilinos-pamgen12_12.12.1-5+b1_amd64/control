Description: hexahedral and quadrilateral mesh generator - runtime files
 PAMGEN creates hexahedral or quadrilateral (in 2D) finite element meshes of
 simple shapes (cubes and cylinders) in parallel. When linked to an application
 as a library, it allows each process of a parallel simulation to generate its
 finite element domain representation at execution time.
 .
 This package contains the dynamic libraries.
