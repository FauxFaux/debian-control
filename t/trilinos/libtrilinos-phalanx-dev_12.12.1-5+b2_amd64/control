Description: local field evaluation kernel - development files
 Phalanx is a local field evaluation kernel specifically designed for general
 partial differential equation solvers. The main goal of Phalanx is to
 decompose a complex problem into a number of simpler problems with managed
 dependencies to support rapid development and extensibility of the PDE code.
 Through the use of template metaprogramming concepts, Phalanx supports
 arbitrary user defined data types and evaluation types. This allows for
 unprecedented flexibility for direct integration with user applications and
 provides extensive support for embedded technology such as automatic
 differentiation for sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification.
