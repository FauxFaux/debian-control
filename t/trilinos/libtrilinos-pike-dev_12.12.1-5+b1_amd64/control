Description: physics integration kernels - development files
 Pike is a software library for coupling and solving multiphysics applications.
 It provides basic interfaces and utilities for performing code-to-code
 coupling. It provides simple black-box Picard iteration methods for solving the
 coupled system of equations including Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel solvers. The
 Pike library contains no physics and just provides interfaces and utilities for
 coupling codes.
 .
 This package provides headers.
