Description: embedded nonlinear analysis package - runtime files
 Piro is the top-level, unifying package of the Embedded Nonlinear Analysis
 Capability area. The main purpose of the package is to provide driver classes
 for the common uses of Trilinos nonlinear analysis tools. These drivers all
 can be constructed similarly, with a ModelEvaluator and a ParameterList, to
 make it simple to switch between different types of analysis. They also all
 inherit from the same base classes (reponse-only model evaluators) so that the
 resulting analysis can in turn driven by non-intrusive analysis routines.
 .
 This package contains the dynamic libraries.
