Description: interoperability tools for PDE solving - development files
 The purpose of Shards is to provide a suite of common tools for numerical and
 topological data that facilitate interoperability between typical software
 modules used to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by finite element,
 finite volume and finite difference methods. Shards comprises of two
 categories of tools: methods to manage and access information about cell
 topologies used in mesh-based methods for PDEs, and methods to work with
 multi-dimensional arrays used to store numerical data in corresponding
 computer codes.
