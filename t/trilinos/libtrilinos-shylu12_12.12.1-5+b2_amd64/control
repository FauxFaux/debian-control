Description: solving sparse linear systems - runtime files
 ShyLU is a package for solving sparse linear systems. It can be used either as
 a preconditioner, or as a solver. Currently, it is recommended as an Ifpack
 preconditioner. ShyLU uses a hybrid direct/iterative approach based on Schur
 complements. The goal is to provide robustness similar to sparse direct
 solvers, but memory usage more similar to preconditioned iterative solvers.
 ShyLU was designed as a node-level solver. It can use both MPI and threads in
 several ways. ShyLU was designed (a) to solve difficult but medium-size
 problems, and (b) to be used as a subdomain solver or smoother for very large
 problems within an iterative scheme. It is a purely algebraic method so can be
 used as a black-box solver. ShyLU has been particularly successful in
 electrical circuit simulation (Xyce).

 This package contains the dynamic libraries.
