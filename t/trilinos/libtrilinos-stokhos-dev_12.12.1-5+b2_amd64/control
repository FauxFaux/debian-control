Description: Trilinos uncertainty quantification package - development files
 Stokhos is a package for intrusive stochastic Galerkin uncertainty
 quantification methods. It provides methods for computing well-known intrusive
 stochastic Galerkin projections such as Polynomial Chaos and Generalized
 Polynomial Chaos, interfaces for forming the resulting nonlinear systems, and
 linear solver methods for solving block stochastic Galerkin linear systems.
 .
 This package provides headers.
