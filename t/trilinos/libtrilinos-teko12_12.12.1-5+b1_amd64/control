Description: block preconditioners - runtime files
 Teko is a package for development and implementation of block preconditioners.
 This includes support for manipulation and setup of block operators.
 Furthermore tools exist to support decomposition of a fully coupled operator.
 Additionally, facilities that allow the construction of approximate inverse
 operators using the full complement of available preconditioners and solvers
 are available in Teko. Finally, a small number of generic block
 preconditioners has been implemented in Teko, including block Jacobi, and
 block Gauss-Seidel. For the Navier-Stokes equation, Teko has implementations
 of SIMPLE, PCD and LSC. For details on these methods see Stabilization and
 Scalable Block Preconditioning for the Navier-Stokes Equations and the
 references therein.
 .
 This package contains the dynamic libraries.
