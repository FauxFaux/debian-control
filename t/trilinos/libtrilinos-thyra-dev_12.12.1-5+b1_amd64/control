Description: interoperability layer for numerical software - development files
 The Thyra package contains a set of interfaces and supporting code that
 defines basic interoperability mechanisms between different types of numerical
 software. The foundation of all of these interfaces are the mathematical
 concepts of vectors, vector spaces, and linear operators. All other interfaces
 and support software is built on the basic operator/vector interfaces.
