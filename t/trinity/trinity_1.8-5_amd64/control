Description: system call fuzz tester
 As 'fuzz testing' suggests, trinity calls syscalls at random, with random
 arguments. Where Trinity differs is that the arguments it passes are not
 purely random.
 .
 If a syscall took, for example, a file descriptor as an argument,
 one of the first things kernels does is validate that fd, if is not valid the
 kernel would just reject it as -EINVAL.
 .
 So on startup, Trinity creates a list of file descriptors, by opening pipes,
 scanning sysfs, procfs, /dev, and creates a bunch of sockets using random
 network protocols. Then when a syscall needs an fd, it gets passed one of
 these at random.
 .
 Trinity also shares those file descriptors between multiple threads, which
 causes havoc sometimes.
 .
 Warning: This program may seriously corrupt your files, including any of those
 that may be writable on mounted network file shares.  It may create network
 packets that may cause disruption on your local network.
 Run at your own risk.
