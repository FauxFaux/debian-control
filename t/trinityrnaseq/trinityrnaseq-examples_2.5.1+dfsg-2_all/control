Description: RNA-Seq De novo Assembly common example and testing files
 Trinity represents a novel method for the efficient and robust de novo
 reconstruction of transcriptomes from RNA-seq data. Trinity combines three
 independent software modules: Inchworm, Chrysalis, and Butterfly, applied
 sequentially to process large volumes of RNA-seq reads. Trinity partitions
 the sequence data into many individual de Bruijn graphs, each representing the
 transcriptional complexity at a given gene or locus, and then processes
 each graph independently to extract full-length splicing isoforms and to tease
 apart transcripts derived from paralogous genes.
