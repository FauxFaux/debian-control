Description: file and directory integrity checker
 Tripwire is a tool that aids system administrators and users in
 monitoring a designated set of files for any changes.  Used with
 system files on a regular (e.g., daily) basis, Tripwire can notify
 system administrators of corrupted or tampered files, so damage
 control measures can be taken in a timely manner.
