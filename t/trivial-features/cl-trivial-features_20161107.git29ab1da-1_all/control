Description: abstraction layer for the *FEATURES* across Common Lisp implementations
 trivial-features ensures consistent *FEATURES* across multiple Common
 Lisp implementations.
 .
 For example, on MacOS X platforms, while most Lisps push `:DARWIN` to
 `*FEATURES*`, CLISP and Allegro push `:MACOS` and `:MACOSX` instead,
 respectively.  Some Lisps might not push any feature suggesting MacOS
 X at all.  trivial-features will make sure all Lisps will have
 `:DARWIN` in the `*FEATURES*` list when running on MacOS X.  This
 way, you can write
 .
    #+darwin foo #-darwin bar
 .
 instead of
 .
    #+(or darwin macos macosx) foo
    #-(or darwin macos macosx) bar
