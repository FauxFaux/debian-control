Description: high performance collections for java
 GNU Trove is a fast, lightweight  implementations of the java.util
 Collections API. These implementations are designed to be pluggable
 replacements for their JDK equivalents.
 .
 Whenever possible, GNU Trove provide the same collections support for
 primitive types. This gap in the JDK is often addressed by using the
 "wrapper" classes (java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Float, etc.) with
 Object-based collections. For most applications, however, collections
 which store primitives directly will require less space and yield
 significant performance gains.
 .
 This package includes the documentation.
