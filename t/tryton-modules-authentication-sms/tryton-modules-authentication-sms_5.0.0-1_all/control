Description: Tryton Application Platform (Authentication SMS Module)
 Tryton is a high-level general purpose application platform. It is the base
 of a complete business solution as well as a comprehensive health and hospital
 information system (GNUHealth).
 .
 This module allows one to authenticate users via SMS. There are two
 authentication methods which can be used in the authentications list of the
 session section in the configuration:
 .
 The sms method just sends a code via SMS to the user. This code can directly
 be used in the login dialog.
 .
 The password_sms method sends a code only after the user entered a valid
 password providing a two-factor authentication method
 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication).
 .
 Both methods require that the user has a *mobile* phone number defined
 otherwise he can not be authenticated with those methods.
