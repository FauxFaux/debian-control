Description: Tryton Application Platform (Purchase Invoice Line Standalone Module)
 Tryton is a high-level general purpose application platform. It is the base
 of a complete business solution as well as a comprehensive health and hospital
 information system (GNUHealth).
 .
 This module adds the possibility to change the behaviour of purchase orders
 to create standalone invoice lines instead of a complete invoice. This allows
 one to compose invoices with lines originating from different purchases.
