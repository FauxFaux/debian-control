Description: Tryton Application Platform (Sale Stock Quantity Module)
 Tryton is a high-level general purpose application platform. It is the base
 of a complete business solution as well as a comprehensive health and hospital
 information system (GNUHealth).
 .
 This module provides a check of the stock quantity of the products when
 quoting a sale. The check will warn the user if the forecast quantity at
 the sale date (and later dates until next supply) is lower than the quantity
 sold by taking into account other sales and the stock forecasts.
