Description: Tryton Application Platform (Stock Forecast Module)
 Tryton is a high-level general purpose application platform. It is the base
 of a complete business solution as well as a comprehensive health and hospital
 information system (GNUHealth).
 .
 This package contains the module for the "Forecast" model in Inventory
 Management.
 .
 The Forecast form allows one to define the expected stock movement towards
 customers in any period of time in the future. A wizard allows one to compute
 the expected quantities with respect to a period in the past. Once the form has
 been confirmed, the corresponding moves are created and spread homogeneously
 across the period. Those moves will allow other processes to take forecasts
 into account.
