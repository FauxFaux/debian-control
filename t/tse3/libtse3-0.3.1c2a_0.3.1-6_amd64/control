Description: portable MIDI sequencer engine in C++
 TSE3 is a portable open source MIDI sequencer engine written in C++.
 It provides programmers with rich and powerful sequencing
 capabilities.  Although it does not provide a user interface, it
 provides a lot of assistance to a UI, attempting to provide as much
 functionality as possible in as generic a manner as possible.
 .
 This package provides the shared library libtse3, which is required
 in order to run programs linked against tse3.
