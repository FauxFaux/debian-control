Description: IBM's TCG Software Stack (TSS) for TPM 2.0 and related utilities
 TSS2 is a user space Trusted Computing Group's Software Stack (TSS) for
 TPM 2.0.  It implements the functionality equivalent to the TCG TSS
 working group's ESAPI, SAPI, and TCTI layers (and perhaps more) but with
 a hopefully far simpler interface.
 .
 It comes with about 80 "TPM tools" that can be used for rapid prototyping,
 education and debugging.
