Description: distributed multi-protocol load testing tool
 Tsung is a distributed load testing tool. It can be used to stress
 HTTP, WebDAV, SOAP, PostgreSQL, MySQL, LDAP and Jabber/XMPP servers.
 .
 The purpose of Tsung is to simulate users in order to test the
 scalability and performance of IP based client/server applications.
 You can use it to do load and stress testing of your servers. Many
 protocols have been implemented and tested, and it can be easily
 extended. WebDAV, LDAP and MySQL support have been added recently
 (experimental).
 .
 For HTTP, it support 1.0 and 1.1 version, has a proxy mode to
 record sessions, support GET and POST method, Cookies and Basic
 WWW-authentication. It also has support for SSL.
 .
 It can be distributed on several client machines and is able to
 simulate hundreds of thousands of virtual users concurrently (or even
 millions if you have enough hardware ...).
