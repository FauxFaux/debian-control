Description: The Bitstream Vera family of free TrueType fonts
 This is a set of high-quality TrueType fonts created by Bitstream, Inc. and

 free high-quality fonts for the free desktop environments.
 .
 They fully cover Western European languages (ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-15) and
 Turkish (ISO-8859-9). They also include a selection of mathematical and other
 symbols and some limited support for Eastern European languages (parts of
 ISO-8859-2). Non-latin scripts are not supported (use ttf-dejavu instead).
