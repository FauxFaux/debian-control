Description: TeX/LaTeX to HTML converter
 LaTeX is popular for specifying complex printed documents.
 TtH translates Plain TeX or LaTeX sources into HTML documents.
 It quickly produces web documents that are compact, editable
 and fast viewing. TtH translates most equations
 instead of converting them into images. This HTML preserves much format
 when imported by MS Word.
