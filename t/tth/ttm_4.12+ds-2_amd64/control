Description: TeX/LaTeX to MathML converter
 LaTeX is popular for specifying complex printed documents.
 TtM translates Plain TeX or LaTeX sources into HTML documents
 with their mathematics in MathML. It quickly produces web documents
 that are compact, editable and fast viewing. TtM translates almost all
 equations instead of converting them into images. TtM is a sister to
 TtH in package tth which translates TeX/LaTeX mathematics to HTML.
