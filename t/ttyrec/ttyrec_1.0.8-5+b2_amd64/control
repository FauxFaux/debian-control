Description: Terminal interaction recorder and player (for tty)
 This package includes "ttyrec", a tty recorder which records terminal
 interaction, and "ttyplay", the player to see that intereaction.
 .
 Ttyrec records your terminal input and output, like the "script" command,
 but additionally records timing information to allow playback at the original
 speed.  It can record any console program, including screen-oriented programs
 such as those using curses.
