Description: sticky 2D shooter
 Tumiki Fighters brings a different twist to the side-scrolling shooter genre.
 With simple 3D graphics, the player has to control a ship and shoot down the
 enemies. The player can swoop in and attach the wreckage to its own hull for
 bonus points and protection from enemy attacks. .
 .
 Tumiki Fighters is another gem among many by Kenta Cho.
