Description: disk and net statistic monitoring systemtap scripts
 The tuned package contains a daemon that tunes system settings dynamically.
 It does so by monitoring the usage of several system components periodically.
 Based on that information components will then be put into lower or higher
 power saving modes to adapt to the current usage. Currently only ethernet
 network and ATA harddisk devices are implemented.
 .
 This package contains several systemtap scripts to allow detailed
 manual monitoring of the system. Instead of the typical IO/sec it collects
 minimal, maximal and average time between operations to be able to
 identify applications that behave power inefficient (many small operations
 instead of fewer large ones).
