Description: daemon for monitoring and adaptive tuning of system devices
 The tuned package contains a daemon that tunes system settings dynamically.
 It does so by monitoring the usage of several system components periodically.
 Based on that information components will then be put into lower or higher
 power saving modes to adapt to the current usage. Currently only ethernet
 network and ATA harddisk devices are implemented.
