Description: assistant to learn algorithms and programming languages
 Turing is a free and cross-platform app whose main goal is to assist
 the learning of algorithms and programming languages by providing
 easy-to-use development tools to all.
 .
 It provides a lighter alternative to the well-known Algobox, which is
 the currently de-facto widely used solution.
 .
 It provides two work modes:
 .
 * Algorithm mode
     * Uses a "natural" pseudocode language similar to the one used in
       Algobox and school books.
     * Assisted development
 * Program mode
     * Uses Python, for the more experienced
 .
 In both modes, the code can be debugged and executed step-by-step to
 facilitate the problem-solving side of development.
