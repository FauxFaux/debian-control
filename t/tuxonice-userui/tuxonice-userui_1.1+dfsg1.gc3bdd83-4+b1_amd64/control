Description: user-space interfaces for TuxOnIce
 TuxOnIce is an alternative implementation to suspend a Linux machine
 by writing its state to memory for later resuming. A kernel patch for
 TuxOnIce is available separately.
 .
 This package contains several user interfaces which improve the user's
 experience during the suspend and resume processes. It also adds TuxOnIce
 support to initramfs and provides a way to configure TuxOnIce settings.
