Description: AnyEvent HTTP server for PSGI (like Thin)
 Twiggy is a lightweight and fast HTTP server with unique features:
  * Can run any PSGI applications. Fully supports psgi.nonblocking
    and psgi.streaming interfaces.
  * This server uses AnyEvent and runs in a non-blocking event loop,
    so it's best to run event-driven web applications that runs I/O bound
    jobs or delayed responses such as long-poll, WebSocket or streaming
    content (server push).
  * Uses XS/C based HTTP header parser for the best performance. (optional)
  * The memory required to run twiggy is 6MB and it can serve more than
    4500 req/s with a single process on Perl 5.10 with MacBook Pro 13"
    late 2009.
  * Supports Server::Starter for hot deploy and graceful restarts.
