Description: a simple secure efficient FTP server
 This is twoftpd, an FTP server that strives to be secure, simple, and
 efficient.  None of the commands can cause execution of other programs,
 and the normal model of execution does a chroot to the logged in user's
 directory immediately after authentication.
 .
 This package sets up the twoftpd service to listen on 0.0.0.0:21, and
 additionally provides a service directory to run an anonymous twoftpd
 service.
