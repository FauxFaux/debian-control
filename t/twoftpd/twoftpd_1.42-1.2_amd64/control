Description: a simple secure efficient FTP server (programs)
 This is twoftpd, an FTP server that strives to be secure, simple, and
 efficient.  None of the commands can cause execution of other programs,
 and the normal model of execution does a chroot to the logged in user's
 directory immediately after authentication.
 .
 The name "twoftpd" comes from the fact that there were two parts to the
 server -- an authenticating front end, which contains no file or data
 transfer code, and a back end, which contains all the data transfer
 code.
 .
 This package contains the twoftpd programs.
