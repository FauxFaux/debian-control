Description: MPEG Audio Layer 2 encoder (development files)
 TwoLAME is an optimized MPEG Audio Layer 2 (MP2) encoder. It is based on
 tooLAME by Mike Cheng, which in turn is based upon the ISO dist10 code and
 portions of LAME.
 .
 TwoLAME does NOT support MPEG Audio Layer 3 (MP3) encoding due to patent
 issues surrounding MP3.
 .
 However, as most MPEG Audio players are able to play layer 2 (MP2) files,
 TwoLAME makes a very good drop-in replacement for LAME and other layer 3
 encoders.
 .
 This package contains the static library and header files.
