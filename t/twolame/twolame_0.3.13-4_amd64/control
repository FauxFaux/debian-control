Description: MPEG Audio Layer 2 encoder (command line frontend)
 TwoLAME is an optimized MPEG Audio Layer 2 encoder. It is based on tooLAME by
 Mike Cheng, which in turn is based upon the ISO dist10 code and portions of
 LAME.
 .
 Because of patent issues surrounding the MPEG Audio Layer 3 (MP3) encoders,
 the ability of most MPEG Audio players to play layer 2 files, and the
 similarity in command-line syntax and API, TwoLAME makes a very good
 drop-in replacement for LAME or other layer 3 encoders.
 .
 This package contains the command line frontend encoder.
