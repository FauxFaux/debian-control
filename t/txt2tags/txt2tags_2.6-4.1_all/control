Description: conversion tool to generating several file formats
 txt2tags is a document generator written in Python that
 generates HTML, XHTML, SGML, LaTeX, Lout, man page, Wikipedia,
 Google Code Wiki, DokuWiki, MoinMoin, Magic Point and PageMaker
 documents from a plain text file with little marks.
 .
 Different from other conversion tools, it is generic, and not
 target-specific (as a txt2html tool). This way, you can keep just
 one source text file and one tool for all your formatting needs.
 .
 Supports header, title, bold/italic/underline/strike, preformatted,
 quote, link, lists, bar, image and table.
 .
 With txt2tags, you can focus your mind on the document content, and
 forget about formatting. Just let the program do this dirty job.
