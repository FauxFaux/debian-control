Description: fast and fully-featured autocomplete library
 typeahead.js is a flexible JavaScript library that provides a strong
 foundation for building robust typeaheads.
 .
 The typeahead.js library consists of 2 components: the suggestion
 engine, Bloodhound, and the UI view, Typeahead. The suggestion engine
 is responsible for computing suggestions for a given query. The UI
 view is responsible for rendering suggestions and handling DOM
 interactions. Both components can be used separately, but when used
 together, they can provide a rich typeahead experience.
