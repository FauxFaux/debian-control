Description: Supposedly "high quality" TypeScript type definitions
 TypeScript type definitions supplied by the DefinitelyTyped project, for
 JavaScript packages that don't supply their own type definitions.
 .
 This description would be longer, but upstream does not give one on their
 website nor on their Github page. After some very painful experience using
 NPM, one can eventually deduce that these definitions are needed for certain
 typescript packages that build on top of javascript packages, where these
 latter packages don't themselves define any typescript types.
 .
 This package contains a subset of the upstream type definitions because there
 are a ridiculous amount (a few hundred megabytes) and the vast majority of
 them are probably never going to be needed for Debian. Currently these are:

 that you can update this package yourself.
