Description: Convert the time and date across time zones
 This tool provides a simple interface for converting the time and date between
 two time zones. Written in Python3 and using QtPy5, this interface allows
 the user to save a certain time zone and restore it after further changes. The
 timezone information is taken from pytz, supplying seven different regions:
 Africa, America, Asia, Australia, Europe, Pacific, and US.
