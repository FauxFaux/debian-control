Description: 2.4 GHz wireless development platform for Bluetooth experimentation
 Project Ubertooth is an open source wireless development platform suitable for
 Bluetooth experimentation. This package contains everything necessary to use
 the hardware dongle.
 .
 Ubertooth is capable of sniffing BLE (Bluetooth Smart) connections and it also
 has some ability to sniff some data from Basic Rate (BR) Bluetooth Classic
 connections.
 .
 In addition to the Bluetooth specific capabilities, there is also a simple
 spectrum analyzer for the 2.4 GHz band included (ubertooth-specan-ui) which
 can be used to also observe other things in this frequency band.
