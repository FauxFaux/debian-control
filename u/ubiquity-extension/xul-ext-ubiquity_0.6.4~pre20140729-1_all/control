Description: browser interface based on natural language input
 Ubiquity was a Mozilla Labs experiment that was in development from 2008 to
 2009. Its purpose was to explore whether a radically different type of
 interface to the Web, a task-centric natural-language-based command line,
 could help get common Web tasks done faster.
 .
 Ubiquity is still available here as Iceweasel/Firefox extension.
