Description: Ubuntu Packaging Guide - common files
 The Ubuntu Packaging Guide is a set of articles that should help you to get
 involved with packaging and development of Ubuntu. It's not meant to replace
 other great documentation like the Debian New Maintainer's Guide or the
 Debian policy, but serve as a starting point with easy and simple to
 understand articles.
 .
 This package contains some common files that are needed by HTML versions of
 the guide.
