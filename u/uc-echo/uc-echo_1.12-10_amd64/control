Description: error correction algorithm designed for short-reads from NGS
 ECHO is an error correction algorithm designed for short-reads
 from next-generation sequencing platforms such as Illumina's
 Genome Analyzer II. The algorithm uses a Bayesian framework to
 improve the quality of the reads in a given data set by employing
 maximum a posteriori estimation.
