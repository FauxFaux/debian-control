Description: protocol adapter between XBoard/CECP and UCI/USI/UCCI engines
 This adapter allows a GUI using the Chess Engine Control Protocol
 (aka. CECP, or XBoard protocol) to communicate with computer players
 using USI (Universal Shogi Interface) or UCCI (Universal Chinese
 Chess Interface) protocols.
 .
 It also support the UCI (Universal Chess Interface) protocol, but for
 this one the "polyglot" package is a recommended alternative from the
 same author.
