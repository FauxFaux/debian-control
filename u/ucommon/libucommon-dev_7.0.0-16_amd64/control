Description: lightweight C++ threading and sockets - development files
 GNU uCommon C++ is a lightweight library to facilitate using C++ design
 patterns even for very deeply embedded applications, such as for
 systems using uClibc along with POSIX threading support. For this
 reason, uCommon disables language features that consume memory or
 introduce runtime overhead. uCommon introduces some design patterns
 from Objective-C, such as reference counted objects, memory pools, and
 smart pointers.  uCommon introduces some new concepts for handling of
 thread locking and synchronization.
 .
 This package contains the development headers and static libraries.
