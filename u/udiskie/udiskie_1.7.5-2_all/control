Description: automounter for removable media for Python
 udiskie is a front-end for UDisks written in Python. Its main purpose is
 automatically mounting removable media, such as CDs or flash drives. It has
 optional mount notifications, a GTK+ tray icon and user level CLIs for manual
 mount and unmount operations. The media will be mounted in a new directory
 under /media or /run/media/USER/, using the device name if possible.
 .
 This package is needed to support automounting removable media when
 nautilus is not available to control UDisks2.
