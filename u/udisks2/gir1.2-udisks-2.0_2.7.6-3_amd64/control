Description: GObject based library to access udisks2 - introspection data
 The udisks daemon serves as an interface to system block devices,
 implemented via D-Bus. It handles operations such as querying, mounting,
 unmounting, formatting, or detaching storage devices such as hard disks
 or USB thumb drives.

 This package provides introspection data for libudisks. It can be used
 by packages using the GIRepository format to generate dynamic bindings.
