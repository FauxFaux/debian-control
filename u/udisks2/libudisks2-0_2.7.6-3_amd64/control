Description: GObject based library to access udisks2
 The udisks daemon serves as an interface to system block devices,
 implemented via D-Bus. It handles operations such as querying, mounting,
 unmounting, formatting, or detaching storage devices such as hard disks
 or USB thumb drives.
 .
 This provides a convenience library for communicating with udisks2 from
 GObject based programs.
