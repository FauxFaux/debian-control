Description: tunnel UDP packets over a TCP connection
 UDPTunnel is a small program which can tunnel UDP packets bi-directionally
 over a TCP connection. Its primary purpose (and original motivation) is to
 allow multi-media conferences to traverse a firewall which allows only
 outgoing TCP connections. UDPTunnel also can be used for security tests in
 networks.
