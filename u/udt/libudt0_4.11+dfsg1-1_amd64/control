Description: UDP-based Data Transfer Protocol
 UDT is a reliable UDP based application level data transport protocol for
 distributed data intensive applications over wide area high-speed networks.
 UDT uses UDP to transfer bulk data with its own reliability control and
 congestion control mechanisms. The new protocol can transfer data at a much
 higher speed than TCP does. UDT is also a highly configurable framework that
 can accommodate various congestion control algorithms.
