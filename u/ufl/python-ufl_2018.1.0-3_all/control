Description: unified language for form-compilers
 UFL (Unified Form Language) is a unified language for definition of
 variational forms intended for finite element discretization. More
 precisely, it defines a fixed interface for choosing finite element
 spaces and defining expressions for weak forms in a notation close to
 mathematical notation.  The form compilers FFC and SyFi use UFL as
 their end-user interface, producing UFC implementations as their
 output.
 .
 This is a dummy package that depends on python3-ufl.
 (UFL is no longer available for Python 2).
