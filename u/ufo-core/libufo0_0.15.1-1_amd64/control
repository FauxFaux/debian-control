Description: Library for high-performance, GPU-based computing - runtime
 The UFO data processing framework is a C library suited to build
 general purpose streams data processing on heterogeneous
 architectures such as CPUs, GPUs or clusters. It is extensively used
 at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology for Ultra-fast X-ray Imaging
 (radiography, tomography and laminography).
 .
 A gobject-instrospection binding is also provided to write scripts or
 user interfaces.
 .
 This package provides the runtime for libufo.
