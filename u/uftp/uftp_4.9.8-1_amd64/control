Description: Encrypted multicast file transfer program
 Utility for secure, reliable, and efficient file transfer to multiple
 receivers simultaneously.  This is useful for distributing large files to a
 large number of receivers, and is especially useful for data distribution over
 a satellite link where the inherent delay makes any TCP based communication
 highly inefficient.
