Description: High-level C++ wrapper library for libxml2/libxslt (development)
 "ui-gxmlcpp" is a high-level C++ wrapper around libxml2 and
 libxslt. It might be a choice for if your needs are some subset
 of:
 .
  - XML DOM Tree parsing.
  - Basic read/write support from/to trees via XPath.
  - Serialization.
  - Stylesheets and stylesheet translation support.
  - XMLSchema and RelaxNG validation.
 .
 If your needs are "lower-level" (e.g., proper DOM tree API
 support or SAX parsing), "gdome2" or "xml++" will be the right
 choices.
 .
 This package provides all files needed for development.
