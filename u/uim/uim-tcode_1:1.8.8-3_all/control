Description: Universal Input Method - T-Code support metapackage
 Uim is an input method module library which supports various scripts and can
 act as a front end for a range of input methods, including Anthy, Canna,
 or SKK (for Japanese), Pinyin (for Chinese), Byeoru (for Korean), and
 M17n (for many other languages). Most of its functions are implemented in
 Scheme, so it's very simple and flexible.
 .
 This package provides uim support for TUT-Code (or "T-Code"), a Japanese
 input method mapping pairs of alphanumeric codes to individual kanji - see
 http://openlab.jp/tcode/ (in Japanese).
