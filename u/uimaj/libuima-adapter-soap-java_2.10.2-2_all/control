Description: Library to provide SOAP web services within UIMA
 Apache UIMA is an implementation of the OASIS-UIMA specifications.
 .
 OASIS UIMA Committee: <http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/uima/>.
 .
 Unstructured Information Management applications are software systems
 that analyze large volumes of unstructured information in order to
 discover knowledge that is relevant to an end user.
 .
 An example UIM application might ingest plain text and identify
 entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or relations,
 such as works-for or located-at.
 .
 This library implements in Java an adapter to connect a SOAP web service with
 the UIMA framework.
