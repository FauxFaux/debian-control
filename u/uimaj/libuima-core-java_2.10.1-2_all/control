 Unstructured Information Management applications are software systems
 that analyze large volumes of unstructured information in order to
 discover knowledge that is relevant to an end user.

 An example UIM application might ingest plain text and identify
 entities, such as persons, places, organizations; or relations,
 such as works-for or located-at.
 .
 This library implements in Java the core features of the UIMA specification.
