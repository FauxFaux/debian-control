Description: Micro In-System Programmer for Atmel's AVR MCUs
 This utility is required to program AVR chips with object code
 created by the ava assembler/linker, gas, or gcc.  It supports
 in-system programming, Atmel's prototype board/programmer (stk500),
 and many other extremely low-cost parallel port programmers.
 It can also be used to program Atmel's AT89S51 and AT89S52.
