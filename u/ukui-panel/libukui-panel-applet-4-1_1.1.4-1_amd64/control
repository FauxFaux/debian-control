Description: library for UKUI Panel applets
 The UKUI Panel is an essential part of the UKUI Desktop, providing

 They are used to launch applications and embed a number of other
 functions, such as quick launch icons, the clock, the notification area,
 volume controls and the battery charge indicator, and utilities ranging
 from weather forecast to system monitoring.
 .
 This package contains the UKUI Panel applet library.
