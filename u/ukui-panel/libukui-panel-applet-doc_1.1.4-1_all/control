Description: library for UKUI Panel applets (documentation files)
 The UKUI Panel is an essential part of the UKUI Desktop, providing
 toolbar-like “panels” which can be attached to the sides of your desktop.
 They are used to launch applications and embed a number of other
 functions, such as quick launch icons, the clock, the notification area,
 volume controls and the battery charge indicator, and utilities ranging
 from weather forecast to system monitoring.
 .
 This package contains the documentation files of the UKUI panel applet
 library.
