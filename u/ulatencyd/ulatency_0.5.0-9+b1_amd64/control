Description: scriptable latency regulator using cgroups (client)
 The userspace latency daemon controls how the Linux kernel spends its
 resources on the running processes. It uses dynamic cgroups to give the
 kernel hints on how to optimize process scheduling.
 .
 This package provides a command-line/Qt4 client which can be used to tune
 and monitor ulatencyd.
