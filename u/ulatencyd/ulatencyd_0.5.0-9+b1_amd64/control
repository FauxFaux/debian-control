Description: scriptable latency regulator using cgroups (server)
 The userspace latency daemon controls how the Linux kernel spends its
 resources on the running processes. It uses dynamic cgroups to give the
 kernel hints on how to optimize process scheduling.
 .
 It is fully scriptable in Lua, to support writing custom rules and
 scheduler code.
 .
 The Linux scheduler does a pretty good job of sharing available resources
 out to all processes, but this may not be the best user experience on the
 desktop. ulatencyd monitors the system and categorizes the running processes
 into cgroups. Processes that run wild and slow down the system will be
 isolated.
