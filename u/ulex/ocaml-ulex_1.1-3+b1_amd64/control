Description: OCaml lexer generator with Unicode support
 ulex is a lexer generator for the Objective Caml (OCaml) programming
 language.
 .
 It is implemented as a Camlp4 syntax extension: lexer specifications
 are embedded in regular OCaml code.
 .
 Generated lexers work with a new kind of "lexbuf" that supports
 Unicode; a single lexer can work with arbitrary encodings of the input
 stream.
