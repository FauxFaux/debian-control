Description: SQLite 3 extension to ulogd
 ulogd is an advanced netfilter logging daemon. It can act as a replacement for
 syslog for logging netfilter ruleset violations (via the NFLOG or ULOG iptables
 targets), can gather per-connection accounting using NFCT, or gather per-rule
 accounting using NFACCT. Output can be sent to plain text log files, a variety
 of SQL database formats, XML files, pcap files, syslog, and many other formats.
 .
 This module adds SQLite 3 support to ulogd. If you install this package, you
 can send netfilter logs or accounting data to an SQLite 3 database.
