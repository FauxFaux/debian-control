Description: Netfilter Userspace Logging Daemon
 ulogd is an advanced netfilter logging daemon. It can act as a replacement for
 syslog for logging netfilter ruleset violations (via the NFLOG or ULOG iptables
 targets), can gather per-connection accounting using NFCT, or gather per-rule
 accounting using NFACCT. Output can be sent to plain text log files, a variety
 of SQL database formats, XML files, pcap files, syslog, and many other formats.
 .
 Support for the DBI database abstraction layer, MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite 3
 databases is in separate packages called ulogd2-dbi, ulogd2-mysql, ulogd2-pgsql
 and ulogd2-sqlite3 respectively. Support for writing to JSON files is the
 ulogd2-json package. Support for writing to pcap files is in the ulogd2-pcap
 package.
