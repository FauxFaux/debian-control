Description: User-mode Linux (utility programs)
 User-mode Linux is a port of the Linux kernel to its own system call
 interface.  It provides a kind of virtual machine, which runs Linux
 as a user process under another Linux kernel.  This is useful for
 kernel development, sandboxing, jailing, experimentation, and
 many other things.
 .
 This package contains userspace utilities for use with User-mode
 Linux, including uml_mconsole, uml_moo, uml_switch, uml_net and
 tunctl.
