Description: development files and documentation for libumockdev
 umockdev mocks hardware devices for creating unit tests for libraries and
 programs that handle Linux hardware devices.
 .
 This library provides an UMockdevTestbed class for running a program or test
 suite under a test bed with the previously recorded devices loaded.
 .
 Right now this covers sysfs, uevents, basic support for /dev devices, and
 recording/mocking usbdevfs ioctls (for PtP/MTP devices).
 .
 With this you can simulate particular hardware in virtual environments up to
 some degree, without needing any particular privileges or disturbing the whole
 system.
 .
 The library supports gobject-introspection and builds a VAPI, so that you can
 also use it with Python, JavaScript, and other languages which support GI, and
 Vala.
 .
 This package contains the header, development, and documentation files which
 are needed for building umockdev applications.
