Description: record/mock hardware devices for bug reports and regression tests
 umockdev mocks hardware devices for creating unit tests for libraries and
 programs that handle Linux hardware devices.
 .
 This package provides tools to record the properties and behaviour of
 particular devices, and to run a program or test suite under a test bed with
 the previously recorded devices loaded.
 .
 Right now this covers sysfs, uevents, basic support for /dev devices, and
 recording/mocking usbdevfs ioctls (for PtP/MTP devices).
 .
 With this you can simulate particular hardware in virtual environments up to
 some degree, without needing any particular privileges or disturbing the whole
 system.
