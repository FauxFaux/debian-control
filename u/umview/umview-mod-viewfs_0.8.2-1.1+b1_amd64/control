Description: View-OS in user space - Filesystem mangling modules
 View-OS is a novel approach to the process/kernel interface.  The semantics of
 each system call can be assigned process by process giving the user the right
 to decide which view of the system each process has to join.  Each process can
 "see" a different file system structure, networking resources, processor,
 devices.  Moreover some of the resources can be provided by the user
 him/herself, thus these resource can be private to the single process and are
 not known a priori by the system.  Groups of processes can share the same view
 but this is just an optimization to share management methods.
 .

 .
 UMView is a user-mode implementation of View-OS.  Processes are run with a
 controlling daemon that captures all the system calls (at present using the
 ptrace() system call) and uses dynamically loadable modules to change their
 semantic.
 .
 This package contains (very experimental) modules that allow filesystem
 namespace mangling (as hiding some portions of the filesystem, creating COW
 subtrees and so on).
