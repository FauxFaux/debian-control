Description: C programmer's library that removes accents from a string
 Unac is a C programmer's library that removes accents from a string.
 For instance the string été will become ete.  It provides a command
 line interface that removes accents from a input flow or a string
 given in argument (unaccent command). In the library function and the
 command, the charset of the input is specified as an argument. The
 input is converted to UTF-16 using iconv(3), accents are stripped and
 the result is converted back to the original charset. The iconv --list
 command on GNU/Linux will show all charset supported.
