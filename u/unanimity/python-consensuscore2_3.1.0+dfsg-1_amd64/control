Description: generate consensus sequences for PacBio data -- Python 2
 ConsensusCore2 embodies core C++ routines underlying the Arrow HMM
 algorithm for PacBio multi-sequence consensus.  Arrow is the successor
 to the Quiver model---a CRF model that was embodied in the
 ConsensusCore C++ library. Compared to Quiver, the Arrow model is more
 statistically principled and easier and more robust to train.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 2.
