Description: generate and process accurate consensus nucleotide sequences
 Unanimity provides a set of tools for consensus sequences from Pacific
 Biosciences sequencing data:
  * Circular Consensus Calling
    ccs takes multiple reads of the same SMRTbell sequence and combines them,
    employing a statistical model, to produce one high quality consensus
    sequence.
  * Minor variant caller
    juliet identifies minor variants from aligned ccs reads.
