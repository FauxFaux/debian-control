Description: utility to securely fetch the root DNS trust anchor
 unbound-anchor is a utility which securely fetches or updates the root DNS
 zone trust anchor. A copy of the current root anchor and root update
 certificate is embedded in unbound-anchor. RFC 5011 trust anchor tracking is
 performed, with fallback to an SSL fetch if this fails.
