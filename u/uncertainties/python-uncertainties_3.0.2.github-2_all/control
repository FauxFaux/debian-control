Description: Python module for calculations with uncertainties
 uncertainties is a Python module, which allows calculations such as
 .
   (0.2 +/- 0.01) * 2 = 0.4 +/- 0.02
 .
 to be performed transparently; much more complex mathematical expressions
 involving numbers with uncertainties can also be evaluated transparently.
 .
 Correlations between expressions are correctly taken into account; x-x is
 thus exactly zero, for instance. The uncertainties produced by this module
 are what is predicted by error propagation theory.
