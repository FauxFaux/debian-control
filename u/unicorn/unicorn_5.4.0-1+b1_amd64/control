Description: Rack HTTP server for fast clients
 Unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve fast
 clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take advantage of
 features in Unix and Unix-like kernels. Slow clients should only be served by
 placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering both request and response
 in between Unicorn and slow clients.
