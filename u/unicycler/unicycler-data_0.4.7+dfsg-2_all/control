Description: hybrid assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes (data package)
 Unicycler is an assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes. It can assemble
 Illumina-only read sets where it functions as a SPAdes-optimiser. It can
 also assembly long-read-only sets (PacBio or Nanopore) where it runs a
 miniasm+Racon pipeline. For the best possible assemblies, give it both
 Illumina reads and long reads, and it will conduct a hybrid assembly.
 .
 This package contains architecture independent data for unicycler.
