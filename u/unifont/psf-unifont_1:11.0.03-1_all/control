Description: PSF (console) version of GNU Unifont with APL support
 This contains a PSF font (Unifont-APL8x16.psf) as a console frame
 buffer font with a subset of Unifont for use with GNU APL and other
 APL implementations.  The font is installed in "/usr/share/consolefonts/".
 This PSF font is only suitable for running in console mode, not under the
 X Window System.
 .
 A PSF font allows a maximum of 512 glyphs.  The glyph subset in this
 font includes ASCII, Latin-1, "oe" and "OE" ligatures for French, the
 Euro sign, Unicode Box Drawing, Unicode Block Elements, plus various
 glyphs for APL support and some other miscellaneous glyphs.  The font
 is monospaced, 8 pixels wide by 16 pixels tall.
 .
 Consider using the TrueType version instead (ttf-unifont) if you are
 not running in console mode, because that version is scalable to any
 point size and has proper combining character support.
