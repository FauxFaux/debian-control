Description: utilities for manipulating GNU Unifont
 This is a set of Perl scripts, C programs, and FontForge scripts
 to manipulate Roman Czyborra's GNU Unifont ".hex" format font
 files.  GNU Unifont has a Unicode-compatible font structure.
 These utilities allow editing ".hex" fonts with text and
 graphical editors, producing final versions of fonts in BDF,
 PCF, PSF, TrueType SBIT, and TrueType outline formats.
 .
 To build the TrueType fonts, install the package 'fontforge'.  To build
 the PCF fonts, use 'bdftopcf', which is in the 'xfonts-utils' package.
 To build the PSF font, use 'bdf2psf', which is in the 'console-setup'
 package.  To obtain the font sources, run 'apt-get source unifont'.
 .
 Building the main Unifont TrueType font will require at least 4 GB of
 main memory.  You only need texlive (~1 GB) if you want to rebuild the
 unifont.pdf file in doc/ (see doc/Makefile); this is not done by default.
