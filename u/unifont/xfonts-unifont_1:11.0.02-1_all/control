Description: PCF (bitmap) version of GNU Unifont
 This contains three fonts: "Unifont" (unifont.pcf.gz),
 "Unifont CSUR" (unifont_csur.pcf.gz),  and
 "Unifont Sample" (unifont_sample.pcf.gz).
 .
 This is a bitmap version of Unifont in a standard X11 format.
 The fonts provide a glyph for each visible code point (character)
 in the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP, or Plane 0).  The BMP
 contains most of the world's modern writing scripts.  These fonts
 look best at 12pt.
 .
 unifont.pcf.gz contains Unicode Plane 0 glyphs.  This is the main font.
 .
 unifont_sample.pcf.gz contains combining circles for combining characters.
 Thus it is suited for illustrating individual Unicode glyphs, whereas
 Unifont is intended for general-purpose writing.
 .
 unifont_csur.pcf.gz contains some scripts in the Plane 0 ConScript
 Unicode Registry (CSUR).  These scripts are not part of the Unicode
 Standard, but are a popular use for the Private Use Area (PUA).
 .
 Complex fonts (such as Indic or Semitic scripts, where letters change
 shape depending on their position in a word, or such as Mongolian, which
 can be written vertically) will not render perfectly.  The philosophy
 behind this font, though, is that anything meaningful is better than
 an empty box for an unknown glyph.
 .
 Consider using the TrueType version instead (ttf-unifont), because
 that version is scalable to any point size and has proper combining
 character support.
