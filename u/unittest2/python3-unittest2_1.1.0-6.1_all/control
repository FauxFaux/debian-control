Description: backport of the enhanced unittest testing framework - Python 3.x
 unittest2 is an enhanced version of unittest including a standard test runner
 (automatic test discovery), class and module level fixtures (setUpClass /
 setUpModule etc), many powerful new assert methods, better resource management
 with addCleanups and a host of other new features. These new features are
 *all* going into the Python version of unittest in Python 2.7 and Python 3.2.
 The point of unittest2 is that it works with Python 2.4 - 2.6; you can use it
 now.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x module.
