Description: Tools for finding out what is in a Unicode file
 Useful tools when working with Unicode files when one doesn't know
 the writing system, doesn't have the necessary font, needs to inspect
 invisible characters, needs to find out whether characters have been
 combined or in what order they occur, or needs statistics on which
 characters occur.
 .
  * uniname defaults to printing the character offset of each character,
    its byte offset, its hex code value, its encoding, the glyph itself,
    and its name. It may also be used to validate UTF-8 input.
  * unidesc reports the character ranges to which different portions of the
    text belong. It can also be used to identify Unicode encodings
    (e.g. UTF-16be) flagged by magic numbers.
  * unihist generates a histogram of the characters in its input.
  * ExplicateUTF8 is intended for debugging or for learning about Unicode.
    It determines and explains the validity of a sequence of bytes as a UTF8
    encoding.
  * utf8lookup provides a handy way to look up Unicode characters from the
    command line.
  * unireverse reverse each line of UTF-8 input character-by-character.
