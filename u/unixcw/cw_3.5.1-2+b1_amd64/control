Description: Morse code tutor - command line user interface
 The unixcw project provides support for learning to use Morse.
 .
 This package provides two executables:
  * cw - a simple command line application that converts key-presses
    to Morse code that can be heard through the console buzzer or a
    sound card;
  * cwgen - a program that generates groups of random characters for
    Morse code practice, which can be piped to the cw program.
 .
 It also includes example files (with the extension "cw") containing
 commands which can be used to change properties such as the speed,
 tone, and spacing of characters.
