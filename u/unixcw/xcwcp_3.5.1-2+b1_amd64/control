Description: Morse code tutor - graphical user interface
 The unixcw project provides support for learning to use Morse code.
 .
 This package provides an interactive Morse code tutor with a Qt4
 user interface. It allows choosing from a number of options for
 practice, including sending random characters, random words, and
 characters from the keyboard. It will also receive Morse code sent
 using the keyboard or mouse as a Morse keyer, and display the
 characters it sees.
