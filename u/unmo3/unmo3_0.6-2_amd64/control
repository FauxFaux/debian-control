Description: Uncompress and extract samples from MO3 modules
 The MO3 format means "MOdule with MP3", because the main initial idea was to
 reduce the size of a module (in .mod, IT, XM) by compressing the samples
 using MPEG audio layer 3. The samples can be compressed using OGG, MP3, and
 two kind of specific lossless algorithms.
