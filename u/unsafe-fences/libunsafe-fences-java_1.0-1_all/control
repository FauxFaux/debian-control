Description: wrapper library around the Java 8 fences API
 unsafe-fences is a very simple Java library that just provides a shim
 around the Java 8 Unsafe methods used for memory fencing.
 .
 In Java 8, three memory-ordering intrinsics were added to the
 sun.misc.Unsafe class: fullFence, storeFence, and loadFence.
 .
 The main goal of unsafe-fences is to allow code in Java 6 and 7
 to compile those calls with a provided boolean guard.
 .
 This is especially useful for projects like JRuby that support
 several JDK versions but it can be reused by other Java projects as
 well.
