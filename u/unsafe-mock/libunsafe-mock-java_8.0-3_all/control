Description: Java library providing backported sun.misc.Unsafe class from JDK 8
 sun.misc.Unsafe is Java class in Oracle JDKs that provides a collection of
 methods for performing low-level, unsafe operations.
 .
 Although the class and all methods are public, use of this class is limited
 because only trusted code can obtain instances of it.
 .
 unsafe-mock provides a current version of sun.misc.Unsafe that
 supports all APIs up through the new "fences" API in Java 8 EA builds
 b71 and later. This Unsafe is a copy of the one from Java 8 EA build
 b71, and it is expected that if you want to build against it you put
 it in javac's bootclasspath. You are responsible for determining in
 your own code whether you can access Unsafe and which methods are
 available; this library is only to provide an all-inclusive Unsafe
 against which you can compile using JDKs <= 8.0.
