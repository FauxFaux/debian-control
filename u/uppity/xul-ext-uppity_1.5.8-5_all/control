Description: toolbar button to "go up" on the web
 Navigate up one level (directory). It will remove an in-page
 anchor, the querystring, the file, and the last directory
 in that order, whichever is first found.
 .
 The keyboard shortcut ALT-Up will also navigate this way.
 Clicking the drop-down arrow next to the toolbar button will
 present that entire list, from where you can navigate directly
 to any of those options.
 The ALT-Down key will also open this list.
