Description: The Ur-Quan Masters - An inter-galactic adventure game
 You return to Earth with a vessel built from technology discovered from an
 ancient race called the Precursors only to find it enslaved. Gather allies
 from a wide variety of races, engage in space combat with various foes, and
 save the galaxy from the Ur-Quan!
 .
 The Ur-Quan Masters is derived from the classic game Star Control II.
 It includes both the adventure game described above and a fast-paced
 Super Melee.
 .
