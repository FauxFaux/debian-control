Description: urweb FastCGI backend
 Ur is a pure, functional, statically typed, strict programming language in the
 tradition of ML and Haskell; however, it features a significantly richer type
 system.  Ur/Web is Ur plus a special standard library and associated rules for
 parsing and optimization.  Ur/Web supports constructing dynamic web
 applications backed by SQL databases.
 .
 This package provides the FastCGI backend for executables compiled with urweb.
