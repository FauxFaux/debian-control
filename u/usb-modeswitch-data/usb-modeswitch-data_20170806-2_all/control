Description: mode switching data for usb-modeswitch
 Several new USB devices have their proprietary Windows drivers onboard,
 especially WAN dongles. When plugged in for the first time, they act
 like a flash storage and start installing the driver from there. If
 the driver is already installed, the storage device vanishes and
 a new device, such as an USB modem, shows up. This is called the
 "ZeroCD" feature.
 .
 On Debian, this is not needed, since the driver is included as a
 Linux kernel module, such as "usbserial". However, the device still
 shows up as "usb-storage" by default. usb-modeswitch solves that
 issue by sending the command which actually performs the switching
 of the device from "usb-storage" to "usbserial".
 .
 This package contains the commands data needed for usb-modeswitch.
