Description: USB multiplexor daemon for iPhone and iPod Touch devices
 usbmuxd, the USB multiplexor daemon, is in charge of coordinating
 access to iPhone and iPod Touch services over USB. Synchronization and
 management applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch need this daemon
 to communicate with such devices concurrently.
 .
 This package includes udev rules to start the daemon when a supported
 device is plugged in, and stop it when all devices are removed.
