Description: implementing the usb-host (*) side of a usbredir connection (development)
 Usbredirhost is a library implementing the usb-host (*) side of a
 usbredir connection. All that an application wishing to implement
 an usb-host needs to do is:
  * Provide a libusb device handle for the device
  * Provide write and read callbacks for the actual transport of usbredir data
  * Monitor for usbredir and libusb read/write events and call their handlers
 .
 This package contains the development header files.
