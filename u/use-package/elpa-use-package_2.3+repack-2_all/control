Description: use-package declaration for simplifying your .emacs
 The `use-package' declaration macro allows you to isolate package
 configuration in your ".emacs" in a way that is performance-oriented and tidy.
 It helps to configure a given package, manage keybindings, diminish minor
 modes, load packages from ELPA with package.el and so on.
