Description: Utility to produce UTF-8 (Unicode) output
 This package contains a command-line tool that can produce UTF-8
 (Unicode) strings in various ways and direct them to standard output,
 standard error or direct to the terminal without the need for shell
 support. Strings can be repeated, delayed, randomly-generated,
 written to arbitrary file descriptors, interspersed with other
 characters and generated using ranges. Printf(1)-style escape
 sequences are supported along with extended escape sequences.
 utfout(1) Sits somewhere between echo(1) and printf(1).
