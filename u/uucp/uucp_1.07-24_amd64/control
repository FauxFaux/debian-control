Description: Unix to Unix Copy Program
 UUCP will copy files to or from another (usually *nix) system, which
 also runs uucp.
 .
 UUCP is used to transfer mail, news and random files between systems
 which are not connected by more modern networks.  The communication can
 be made via modems, direct (hard-wired) serial connections or via an IP
 connection.
