Description: Non-blocking streaming Unicode codec for OCaml (plugins)
 Uutf is an non-blocking streaming Unicode codec for OCaml to decode
 and encode the UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE encoding
 schemes. It can efficiently work character by character without
 blocking on IO. Decoders perform character position tracking and
 support newline normalization.
 .
 Functions are also provided to fold over the characters of UTF
 encoded OCaml string values and to directly encode characters in
 OCaml Buffer.t values
 .
 This package contains dynamically loadable modules for plugins.
