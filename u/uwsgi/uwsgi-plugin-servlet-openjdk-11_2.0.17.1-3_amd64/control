Description: JWSGI plugin for uWSGI (OpenJDK 11)
 uWSGI presents a complete stack for networked/clustered web applications,
 implementing message/object passing, caching, RPC and process management.
 It is designed to be fully modular. This means that different plugins can be
 used in order to add compatibility with tons of different technology on top of
 the same core.
 .
 This package provides Servlet 2.5 plugin for uWSGI
 (linked with OpenJDK 11 runtime).
