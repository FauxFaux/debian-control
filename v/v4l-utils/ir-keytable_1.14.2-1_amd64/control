Description: Alter keymaps of Remote Controller devices
 This package allows one to change the keymap of controller receivers.
 Those receivers are found as infrared receivers on DVB sticks or on
 framegrabber cards. Via ir-keytable the mapping from a scancode to
 the generated event can be customized and made persistent.
