Description: share a common package cache among similar VM instances
 A Vagrant plugin that helps you reduce the amount of coffee you drink
 while waiting for boxes to be provisioned by sharing a common package
 cache among similar VM instances. Kinda like vagrant-apt_cache or
 this magical snippet but targeting multiple package managers and
 Linux distros.
