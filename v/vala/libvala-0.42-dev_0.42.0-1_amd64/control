Description: C# like language for the GObject system - development headers
 Vala is a new programming language that aims to bring modern
 programming language features to GNOME developers without imposing
 any additional runtime requirements and without using a different ABI
 compared to applications and libraries written in C.
 .
 This package has the development library and headers for valac. These
 headers can be used for building tools around Vala.
