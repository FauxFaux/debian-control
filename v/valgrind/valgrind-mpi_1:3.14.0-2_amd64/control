Description: instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools (MPI module)
 Valgrind is a system for debugging and profiling Linux programs. With its tool
 suite you can automatically detect many memory management and threading bugs,
 avoiding hours of frustrating bug-hunting and making your programs more stable.
 You can also perform detailed profiling to help speed up your programs and use
 Valgrind to build new tools.
 .
 This package provides the "mpiwrap" library for debugging distributed-memory
 applications which use the MPI message passing standard.
