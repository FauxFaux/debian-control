Description: open-source graphical user interface for the Valgrind
 Valkyrie is an open-source graphical user interface for the Valgrind
 3.6.X line. Valkyrie uses the Qt widget library, and is based on
 Valgrind`s XML output capabilities. Valkyrie is designed for simplicity
 and ease of use, whilst allowing access to the full range of Valgrind
 command-line options.
 .
 Currently, Valkyrie supports Memcheck only, although work is in progress
 to handle Cachegrind and Massif.
