Description: audio analysis and feature extraction plugins (SDK)
 Vamp is an audio processing plugin system for plugins that extract
 descriptive information from audio data - typically referred to as
 audio analysis plugins or audio feature extraction plugins.
 .
 Just like an audio effects plugin (such as a VST), a Vamp plugin is a
 binary module that can be loaded up by a host application and fed
 audio data. However, unlike an effects plugin, a Vamp plugin outputs
 not processed audio but some sort of symbolic information. Typical
 things that a Vamp plugin might calculate include the locations of
 moments such as note onset times, visual representations of the audio
 such as histograms, or curve data such as power or fundamental
 frequency.
 .
 Hosts using Vamp plugins include Audacity and Sonic Visualiser.
 .
 This package contains C and C++ header files for developing Vamp
 plugins and hosts as well as source code of example plugins and a
 simple host.
