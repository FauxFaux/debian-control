Description: Additional protections for Tor Onion Services
 vanguards uses the Stem Tor control port library to connect to a Tor control
 port. It has three defense subsystems: Vanguards, Rendguard, and Bandguards.
 All three subsystems apply to both service-side and client-side onion service
 activity, but NOT to any client traffic that exits the Tor network to the
 normal Internet.
