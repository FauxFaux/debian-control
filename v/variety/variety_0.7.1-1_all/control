Description: Wallpaper changer, downloader and manager
 Variety is a wallpaper manager for Linux systems. It supports numerous
 desktops and wallpaper sources, including local files and online
 services: Flickr, Wallhaven, Unsplash, and more.
 .
 Where supported, Variety sits as a tray icon to allow easy pausing and
 resuming. Otherwise, its desktop entry menu provides a similar set of
 options.
 .
 You can also install the following (suggested) packages to enhance Variety's
 functionality on certain desktop setups:
  * feh | nitrogen: used for wallpaper changing on i3, openbox, and dwm
  * gnome-shell-extension-appindicator | gnome-shell-extension-top-icons-plus:
    adds tray icon / indicator support to GNOME Shell, so that Variety's tray
    icon can be displayed
