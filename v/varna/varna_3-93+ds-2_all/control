Description: Visualization Applet for RNA
 VARNA is Java lightweight Applet dedicated to drawing the secondary structure
 of RNA. It is also a Swing component that can be very easily included in an
 existing Java code working with RNA secondary structure to provide a fast and
 interactive visualization.
 .
 Being free of fancy external library dependency and/or network access, the
 VARNA Applet can be used as a base for a standalone applet. It looks
 reasonably good and scales up or down nicely to adapt to the space available
 on a web page, thanks to the anti-aliasing drawing primitives of Swing.
