Description: variant detection in next-generation sequencing data
 Variant detection in massively parallel sequencing. For one sample,
 calls SNPs, indels, and consensus genotypes. For tumor-normal pairs,
 further classifies each variant as Germline, Somatic, or LOH, and also
 detects somatic copy number changes.
