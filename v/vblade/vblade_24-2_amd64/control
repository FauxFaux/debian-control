Description: virtual AoE blade emulator
 The vblade is the virtual EtherDrive (R) blade, a program that makes a
 seekable file available over an ethernet local area network (LAN) via
 the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) protocol.
 .
 The seekable file is typically a block device like /dev/md0 but even
 regular files will work.  Sparse files can be especially convenient.
 When vblade exports the block storage over AoE it becomes a storage
 target.  Another host on the same LAN can access the storage if it has
 a compatible aoe kernel driver.
