Description: library to extract information from VideoCD (development files)
 This package contains development files (headers and static library)
 for the libvcdino library.
 .
 This library can be used to extract information stored on a
 VideoCD. One use is in media players, such as xine and vlc (where in
 fact it is currently used). Here libvcdinfo assists in VideoCD
 navigation, playback control and showing what is contained on a
 VideoCD. Some standalone programs for this library are vcd-info and
 vcdxrip (part of the VCDImager distribution).
