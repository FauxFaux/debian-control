Description: LADSPA plugin sporting anti-aliased oscillators
 This plugin contains three anti-aliased oscillators, all based on the
 concept of using precomputed bandlimited Dirac pulses to construct the
 classical waveforms. They are both memory and CPU efficient. The first
 one produces a flat spectrum (impulses) and the second generates a
 sawtooth waveform. The third one (new in 0.3.0), provides a variable
 width rectangular waveform.
