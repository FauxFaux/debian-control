Description: record and replay HTML interactions (Documentation)
 vcr.py records all interactions that take place through the HTML libraries
 it supports and writes them to flat files, called cassettes (YAML format by
 default). These cassettes could be replayed then for fast, deterministic
 and accurate HTML testing.
 .
 vcr.py supports the following Python HTTP libraries:
  - urllib2 (stdlib)
  - urllib3
  - http.client (Python3 stdlib)
  - Requests
  - httplib2
  - Boto (interface to Amazon Web Services)
  - Tornado's HTTP client
 .
 This package contains the documentation.
