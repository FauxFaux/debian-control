Description: Version Control System for $HOME - multiple Git repositories in $HOME
 vcsh allows you to have several git repositories, all maintaining their working
 trees in $HOME without clobbering each other. That, in turn, means you can have
 one repository per config set (zsh, vim, ssh, etc), picking and choosing which
 configs you want to use on which machine.
