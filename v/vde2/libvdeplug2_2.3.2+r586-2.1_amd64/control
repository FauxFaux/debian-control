Description: Virtual Distributed Ethernet - Plug library
 VDE is a virtual switch that can connect multiple virtual machines together,
 both local and remote.
 .
 Components of the VDE architecture are VDE switches (virtual counterpart of
 ethernet switches) and VDE cables (virtual counterpart of a crossed-cable used
 to connect two switches).
 .
 This package contains a library that makes programs able to connect to a local
 VDE switch. The simplest one is vde_plug, contained in the vde2 package.
