Description: debugging static library for the VDK C++ library version 2
 The Visual Development Kit (VDK) is a C++ library
 that wraps the GTK+ toolkit.
 .
 The package also includes the VDK Component Library which
 contains some  useful new  components not available in pure
 GTK+.
 .
 Programming in VDK is much like programming in VCL
 and Borland C++ Builder.
 .
 This package contains the debugging static libraries for the
 VDK C++ library.
 .
 The debugging libraries are installed as /usr/lib/libvdk_g.a
 Link specifically with them if you want to debug.
