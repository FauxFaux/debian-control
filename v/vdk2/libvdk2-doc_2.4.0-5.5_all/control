Description: documentation for VDK library version 2
 The Visual Development Kit (VDK) is a C++ library
 that wraps the GTK+ toolkit.

 The package also includes the VDK Component Library which
 contains some  useful new  components not available in pure
 GTK+.
 .
 Programming in VDK is much like programming in VCL
 and Borland C++ Builder.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static libraries for
 the VDK C++ and for the VDK Component libraries.
 .
 Install this package if you want the html documentation of VDK.
