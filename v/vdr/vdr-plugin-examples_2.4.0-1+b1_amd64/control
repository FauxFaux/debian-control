Description: Plugins for vdr to show some possible features
 Video Disk Recorder (VDR) is a digital sat-receiver program using
 Linux and DVB technologies. It allows one to record MPEG2 streams,
 as well as output the stream to TV.
 .
 This package contains the example-plugins hello, osddemo, svccli,
 svcsvr, skincurses, status and svdrpdemo from the vdr-source.
 These plugins do not have useful features, they only demonstrate
 how vdr-plugins work and what is possible to do with them.
