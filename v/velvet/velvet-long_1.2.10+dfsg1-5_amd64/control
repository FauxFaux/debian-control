Description: Nucleic acid sequence assembler for very short reads, long version
 Velvet is a de novo genomic assembler specially designed for short read
 sequencing technologies, such as Solexa or 454, developed by Daniel Zerbino and
 Ewan Birney at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), near
 Cambridge, in the United Kingdom.
 .
 Velvet currently takes in short read sequences, removes errors then produces
 high quality unique contigs. It then uses paired read information, if
 available, to retrieve the repeated areas between contigs.
 .
 This package installs special long-mode versions of Velvet, as recommended
 in the Velvet tutorials.
