Description: Test data for the Velvet sequence assembler
 Velvet is a de novo genomic assembler specially designed for short read
 sequencing technologies, such as Solexa or 454, developed by Daniel Zerbino and
 Ewan Birney at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), near
 Cambridge, in the United Kingdom.
 .
 Velvet currently takes in short read sequences, removes errors then produces
 high quality unique contigs. It then uses paired read information, if
 available, to retrieve the repeated areas between contigs.
 .
 This package contains the test data to run the unit tests of Velvet, a de novo
 genomic assembler, that could be used as additional set of examples.
