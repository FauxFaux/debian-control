Description: Programmable verification and analysis tool for C++
 Vera++ is a programmable tool for verification, analysis and transformation of
 C++ source code.
 Vera++ is mainly an engine that parses C++ source files and presents the
 result of this parsing to scripts in the form of various collections -
 the scripts are actually performing the requested tasks.
