Description: Create arbitrary-res modelines using hardware parameters
 Videogen is a small but nice utility to create modelines you can
 insert into your xorg.conf and fb.modes files.
 .
 Modeline is created by telling the program the resolution you want
 and your video hardware parameters (maximum video adapter
 bandwidth, maximum HCF and VCF of the monitor etc).
 .
 Note that for most modern installations, Xorg will handle its own modesetting
 automatically, and you don't need videogen to generate any Modelines.
 .
 The tool 'some_modes' may help you to create some common modes fast.
