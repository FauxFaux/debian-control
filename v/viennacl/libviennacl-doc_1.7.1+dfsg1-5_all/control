Description: ViennaCL API and user documentation
 The Vienna Computing Library (ViennaCL) is a scientific computing library
 written in C++ and based on OpenCL. It allows simple, high-level access to the
 vast computing resources available on parallel architectures such as GPUs and
 is primarily focused on common linear algebra operations (BLAS levels 1, 2 and
 3) and the solution of large systems of equations by means of iterative
 methods with optional preconditioner.
 .
 This package contains the Doxygen-generated source code and the user
 documentation.
