Description: graphical front end for computational chemistry programs
 Viewmol is able to graphically aid in the generation of molecular
 structures for computations and to visualize their results.
 .
 At present Viewmol includes input filters for Discover, DMol3, Gamess,
 Gaussian 9x/03, Gulp, Mopac, PQS, Turbomole, and Vamp outputs as well as
 for PDB files. Structures can be saved as Accelrys' car-files, MDL files,
 and Turbomole coordinate files. Viewmol can generate input files for
 Gaussian 9x/03. Viewmol's file format has been added to OpenBabel so that
 OpenBabel can serve as an input as well as an output filter for
 coordinates.
