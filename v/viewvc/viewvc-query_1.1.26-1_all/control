Description: utility to query CVS and Subversion commit database
 ViewVC is a browser (web) interface for CVS and Subversion version
 control repositories.  It generates templatized HTML to present
 navigable directory, revision, and change log listings.  It can display
 specific versions of files as well as diffs between those versions.
 .
 This package includes query.cgi (and equivalent FastCGI and mod-python
 variants): a utility to query a separate CVS and Subversion commit database.
 You can search for multiple matches by typing comma-separated lists into the
 text fields.  Regular expressions and wildcards are also supported.  It
 requires a stand-alone MySQL database server.
