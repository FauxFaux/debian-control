Description: VI Like Emacs - vi work-alike
 vile is a text editor which is extremely compatible with vi in terms of
 ``finger feel''.  In addition, it has extended capabilities in many areas,
 notably multi-file editing and viewing, syntax highlighting, key rebinding,
 an optional embedded perl interpreter, and real X window system support.
 .
 This package contains the character-mode binary.  Required support files
 are contained in vile-common.  Source code highlighting filters are in
 vile-filters.  An X11 binary is in the xvile package.
