Description: snippet solution for Vim
 UltiSnips provides snippet management for the Vim editor. A snippet is a short
 piece of text that is either re-used often or contains a lot of redundant
 text. UltiSnips allows you to insert a snippet with only a few key strokes.
 Snippets are common in structured text like source code but can also be used
 for general editing like, for example, inserting a signature in an email or
 inserting the current date in a text file.
 .
 This plugin can utilize the snippets provided by the vim-snippets package.
