Description: fast, as-you-type, fuzzy-search code completion engine for Vim
 YouCompleteMe is a fast, as-you-type, fuzzy-search code completion engine
 for Vim. It has several completion engines: an identifier-based engine
 that works with every programming language, a semantic, Clang-based
 engine that provides native semantic code completion for
 C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++ and an omnifunc-based completer that uses data
 from Vim's omnicomplete system to provide semantic completions for many
 other languages (Ruby, PHP etc.).
