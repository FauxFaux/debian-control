Description: fold text in GNU Emacs like in Vim
 This is a package for GNU Emacs to perform text folding like in Vim. It has
 the following features:
 .
  * folding of active regions;
  * good visual feedback: it's obvious which part of text is folded;
  * persistence by default: when you close file your folds don't disappear;
  * persistence scales well, you can work on hundreds of files with lots of
    folds without adverse effects;
  * it doesn't break indentation or something;
  * folds can be toggled from folded state to unfolded and back very easily;
  * quick navigation between existing folds;
  * you can use mouse to unfold folds (good for beginners and not only for
    them);
  * for fans of `avy' package: you can use `avy' to fold text with minimal
    number of key strokes!
