Description: vine Python promises documentation
 A Python implementation of the promise pattern for asynchronous programming.
 .
 This is a special implementation of promises in that it can be used both for
 "promise of a value" and lazy evaluation. The biggest upside for this is that
 everything in a promise can also be a promise, e.g. filters, callbacks and
 errbacks can all be promises.
 .
 This is the documentation package.
