Description: Cross-platform Atari Jaguar emulator
 Virtual Jaguar is a cross-platform emulator for Atari's infamous
 Jaguar console, the last video game system to be ever released by
 the now defunct company. The Jaguar was marketed as the first
 64-bit video game system despite the fact that it was actually
 a 32-bit system at heart, just the blitter operated in 64-bit
 mode. The system was a commercial failure and eventually lead
 to Atari leaving the market for video game systems for good.
 .
 This emulator features an intuitive user interface and emulation
 of all of the major subsystems of the Atari Jaguar console. This
 includes full GPU and DSP emulation as well as emulation of the
 Atari Jaguar CD. Most of the commercial Atari games are supported,
 albeit some of them have some minor glitches when running in the
 emulator.
