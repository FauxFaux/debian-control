Description: Modern, legacy free, simple yet efficient vim-like editor
 Vis aims to be a modern, legacy free, simple yet efficient editor
 combining the strengths of both vi(m) and sam. It extends vi's modal
 editing with support for multiple cursors/selections and combines it
 with sam's structural regular expression based command language.
 .
 As an universal editor it has decent Unicode support and should cope
 with arbitrary files including: large, binary or single-line ones.
 Syntax highlighting is provided using Parsing Expression Grammars which
 can be conveniently expressed using Lua in the form of LPeg.
 .
 The editor core is written in a reasonable amount of clean (your mileage
 may vary), modern and legacy free C code, enabling it to run in resource
 constrained environments. The implementation should be easy to hack
 on and encourage experimentation. There also exists a Lua API for
 in-process extensions.
 .
 Vis strives to be simple and focuses on its core task: efficient text
 management. Clipboard and digraph handling as well as a fuzzy file open
 dialog are all provided by independent utilities.
 .
 The intention is not to be bug for bug compatible with vi(m), instead
 the aim is to provide powerful editing features based on an elegant
 design and clean implementation.
