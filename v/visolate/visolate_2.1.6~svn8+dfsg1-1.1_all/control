Description: tool for engraving PCBs using CNCs
 Visolate reads the gerber files describing printed circuit boards and converts
 them into the G-code (RS-274 code) needed to engrave the layout into a board
 using a CNC machine. Precise renditions of the original layout can be created
 as well as voronoi fillings of the original layout, shortening the toolpath.
