Description: alternative visualization techniques for analysis of paje trace files
 Viva implements alternative trace visualization techniques for the
 analysis of parallel and distributed applications. The tool also serves
 as a sandbox to the development of new visualization techniques.
 .
 Current features include:
 .
  - Temporal integration using dynamic time-intervals
  - Spatial aggregation through hierarchical traces
  - Interactive Graph Visualization with a force-directed algorithm, with viva
  - Squarified Treemap to compare processes behavior on scale, with vv_treemap
