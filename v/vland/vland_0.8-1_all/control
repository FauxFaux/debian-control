Description: LAVA Coordinator daemon
 VLANd is a python program intended to make it easy to manage
 port-based VLAN setups across multiple switches in a network. It is
 designed to be vendor-agnostic, with a clean pluggable driver API to
 allow for a wide range of different switches to be controlled
 together.
