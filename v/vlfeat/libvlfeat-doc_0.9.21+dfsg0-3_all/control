Description: Computer vision library focussing on visual features and clustering
 VLFeat implements popular computer vision algorithms including MSER, k-means,
 hierarchical k-means, agglomerative information bottleneck, and quick shift. It
 is written in C for efficiency and compatibility, with interfaces in GNU octave
 for ease of use, and detailed documentation throughout. Note that some of the
 upstream library is under patent protection, and those components (SIFT for
 instance) are not included in this package
 .
