Description: mail user agent for Emacs
 VM (View Mail) is an Emacs subsystem that allows UNIX mail to be read
 and disposed of within Emacs.  Commands exist to do the normal things
 expected of a mail user agent, such as generating replies, saving
 messages to folders, deleting messages and so on.  There are other
 more advanced commands that do tasks like bursting and creating
 digests, message forwarding, and organizing message presentation
 according to various criteria.  With smtpmail in modern emacsen, you do
 not need an MTA locally in order to use VM.
 .
 This package does not cater to XEmacs, since vm comes (by default)
 bundled in with XEmacs.
