Description: Tools to access VMFS filesystems
 VMFS is a clustered filesystem designed to store virtual machine disks for
 VMware ESX or ESXi Server hosts. This set of tools allows to access these
 filesystems from some other non ESX/ESXi host for e.g. maintenance tasks.
 .
 Only read access is available at the moment, but write access is under
 works. Multiple extents are supported.
 .
 The VMFS can be accessed with a command line tool or mounted through a
 userspace filesystem (FUSE-based).
