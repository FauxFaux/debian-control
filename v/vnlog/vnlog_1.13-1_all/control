Description: Toolkit to read/write/manipulate whitespace-separated ASCII logs
 Vnlog (pronounced "vanillog") is a trivially-simple log format consisting of an
 ASCII table with comments and labelled fields. This package provides tools to
 process and manipulate such logs. The tools are:
 .
 vnl-filter selects a subset of the rows/columns in a vnlog and/or to
 manipulates the contents. This is effectively an awk wrapper.
 .
 vnl-sort, vnl-join and vnl-tail are wrappers around the corresponding GNU
 Coreutils tools
 .
 vnl-align aligns vnlog columns for easy interpretation by humans
 .
 vnl-make-matrix converts a one-point-per-line vnlog to a matrix of data
