Description: console-based network traffic monitor
 vnStat is a network traffic monitor for Linux. It keeps a log of
 daily network traffic for the selected interface(s). vnStat is not
 a packet sniffer. The traffic information is analyzed from the /proc
 filesystem, so vnStat can be used without root permissions.
