Description: advanced memory forensics framework
 The Volatility Framework is a completely open collection of tools for
 the extraction of digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples.
 It is useful in forensics analysis. The extraction techniques are
 performed completely independent of the system being investigated but
 offer unprecedented visibility into the runtime state of the system.
 .
 Volatility supports memory dumps from all major 32- and 64-bit Windows
 versions and service packs. Whether your memory dump is in raw format,
 a Microsoft crash dump, hibernation file, or virtual machine snapshot,
 Volatility is able to work with it.
 .
 Linux memory dumps in raw or LiME format are supported too. There are
 several plugins for analyzing memory dumps from 32- and 64-bit Linux
 kernels and relevant distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE,
 RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, Mandriva, etc.
 .
 Volatility also support several versions of Mac OSX memory dumps, both
 32- and 64-bit. Android phones with ARM processors are also supported.
 .
 These are some of the data that can be extracted from a memory image:
    - Image information (date, time, CPU count);
    - Running processes;
    - Open network sockets and connections;
    - OS kernel modules loaded;
    - Memory maps for each process;
    - Executables samples;
    - Command history;
    - Suspicious process mappings (i.e. injected code);
    - Passwords, as LM/NTLM hashes and LSA secrets;
    - Cached Truecrypt passphrases;
    - Others.
 .
 Current version (2.6) supports investigations of the memory images from
 the following operational systems:
    - 32-bit Windows XP Service Pack 2 and 3
    - 32-bit Windows 2003 Server Service Pack 0, 1, 2
