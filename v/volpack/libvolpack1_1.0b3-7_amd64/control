Description: fast volume rendering library
 VolPack is a software library for fast, high-quality volume rendering with
 this features:
  * Renders data sampled on a regular, three-dimensional grid.
  * Supports user-specified transfer functions for both opacity and color.
  * Provides a shading model with directional light sources, multiple material
    types with different reflective properties, depth cueing, and shadows.
  * Produces color (24 bits/pixel) or grayscale (8 bits/pixel) renderings,
    with or without an alpha channel.
  * Supports arbitrary affine view transformations.
  * Supports a flexible data format that allows an arbitrary C structure to be
    associated with each voxel.
