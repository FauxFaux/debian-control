Description: Python 3 library to validate data
 Voluptuous is primarily intended to validate data coming in to Python
 as JSON, YAML, etc. The aim is to offer a light-weight style with three
 main goals:
  1. simplicity
  2. support for complex data structures
  3. provide useful error messages
 .
 It has been inspired by Validino and to a lesser extent by jsonvalidator and
 json_schema.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3.x module.
