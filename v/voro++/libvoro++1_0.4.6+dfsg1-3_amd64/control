Description: library for the computation of the Voronoi diagram (shared library)
 Voro++ is a software library for carrying out three-dimensional computations
 of the Voronoi tessellation. A distinguishing feature of the Voro++ library is
 that it carries out cell-based calculations, computing the Voronoi cell for
 each particle individually. It is particularly well-suited for applications
 that rely on cell-based statistics, where features of Voronoi cells (eg.
 volume, centroid, number of faces) can be used to analyze a system of
 particles.
 .
 This package provides the shared library.
