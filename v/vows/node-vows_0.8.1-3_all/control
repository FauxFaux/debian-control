Description: asynchronous BDD & continuous integration for Node
 Node is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
 .
 Vows is a behavior driven development (BDD) framework for Node.
 .
 Vows was built from the ground up to test asynchronous code.  It
 executes your tests in parallel when it makes sense, and sequentially
 when there are dependencies.
 .
 Emphasis was put on speed of execution, clarity and user experience.
 .
 This package contains the vows library for Node, and the script vows
 for running tests from the commandline.
