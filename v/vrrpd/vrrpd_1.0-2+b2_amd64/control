Description: Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol user-space implementation
 This package provides an implementation of VRRPv2 as specified in rfc2338.
 It runs in the Linux kernel's userspace (as root).
 .
 VRRP can be used to setup high-availability services in Debian since two
 machines can use the same (virtual) IP address which is transfered upon
 failover. Some kernel features need to be enabled (please read the FAQ)
