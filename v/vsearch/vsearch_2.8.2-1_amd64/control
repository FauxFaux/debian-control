Description: tool for processing metagenomic sequences
 Versatile 64-bit multithreaded tool for processing metagenomic sequences,
 including searching, clustering, chimera detection, dereplication, sorting,
 masking and shuffling
 .
 The aim of this project is to create an alternative to the USEARCH tool
 developed by Robert C. Edgar (2010). The new tool should:
 .
  - have a 64-bit design that handles very large databases and much more
    than 4GB of memory
  - be as accurate or more accurate than usearch
  - be as fast or faster than usearch
