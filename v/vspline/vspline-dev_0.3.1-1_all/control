Description: header-only C++ template library for uniform b-spline processing
 vspline aims to be as fast as possible, it's main focus is processing
 of bulk data, especially images. vspline can create b-splines of:
 .
  -  real data types and their aggregates
  -  coming in strided n-dimensional memory
  -  spline order up to 24
  -  arbitrary dimensions of the spline
  -  with a reasonable selection of boundary conditions
  -  with implicit or explicit scheme of extrapolation
 .
 on the evaluation side it provides:
 .
  -  evaluation of the spline at point locations
  -  evaluation of the spline's derivatives
  -  fast specializations for nearest neighbour and linear interpolation
  -  mapping of arbitrary coordinates into the defined range
  -  evaluation of n-dimensional arrays of coordinates ('remap' function)
  -  functor-based transform and apply functions
  -  set of functional constructs to facilitate evaluation
 .
 data handling is done with vigra data types.
 vspline optionally uses horizontal vectorization with Vc.
 coefficient generation and remap routines are multithreaded.
