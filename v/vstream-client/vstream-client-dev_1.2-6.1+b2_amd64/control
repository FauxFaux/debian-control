Description: Development headers for vstream-client
 Vstream-client is a fork off of the vstream library from the
 tivo-mplayer project. It has been stripped down to just the
 client code, and includes an example client application. If
 you have vserver installed on your Tivo (which most tivo hackers
 do), then you can use this simple client to stream .ty files
 from it. MPlayer includes support for this library. This
 library can be used by MPlayer/MEncoder to watch/re-encode tivo
 streams live over a network.
 .
 This package contains the headers for development.
