Description: Virtual Tab Window Manager
 VTWM is an enhanced version of the Tab window manager (TWM) that adds many
 features -- primarily a virtual desktop, meaning that what is currently on
 screen is just a portion of a larger workspace.  What portion of the virtual
 desktop that is displayed, and whatever windows might be visible within it,
 are simple point-and-click operations within a scaled representation of the
 workspace.
