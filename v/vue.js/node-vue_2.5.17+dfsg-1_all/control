Description: Core library of the Vue JavaScript framework
 Vue is a flexible, non-opinionated, non-monolithic, incrementally adoptable
 JavaScript framework for building user interfaces with JavaScript or
 TypeScript.
 .
 It provides data-reactive components with a simple and flexible API.
 .
 The core library focuses on declarative rendering and component composition.
 .
 Vue core when used in combination with its supporting libraries and modern
 tooling is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page
 Applications.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
