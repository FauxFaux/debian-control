Description: tool for visualizing logs of USB packets
 The Virtual USB Analyzer is a tool for visualizing logs of USB packets, from
 hardware or software USB sniffer tools.
 .
 Currently, it supports two log formats (but it's designed to be easily
 extensible):
 .
  * Logged USB traffic from debug builds of VMware Fusion, Workstation, or
    Player.
  * XML logs from the Ellisys USB Explorer 200, a hardware USB 2.0 analyzer.
