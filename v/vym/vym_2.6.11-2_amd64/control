Description: mindmapping tool
 Vym is a mind mapping program. It is useful to organize thoughts and
 do structure work. In addition to that it has a lot of helpful
 shortcuts.
 .
 A mindmap is a multicolored and image centered radial diagram that
 represents semantic or other connections between portions of learned
 material.  For example, it can graphically illustrate the structure
 of a thesis outline, a project plan, or the government institutions
 in a state.  Mindmaps have many applications in personal, family,
 educational, and business situations.  Possibilities include
 note-taking, brainstorming, summarizing, revising and general
 clarifying of thoughts.
