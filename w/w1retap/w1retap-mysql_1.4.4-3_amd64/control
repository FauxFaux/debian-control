Description: Data logger for 1-Wire weather sensors (MySQL plugin)
 The w1retap package reads weather sensors on a 1-Wire bus and logs the
 retrieved data to the configured databases or files. It supports a number of
 different 1-Wire host bus adapters and 1-Wire sensors designed by Dallas
 Semiconductor Corp (now Maxim Integrated) and compatible sensors including
 those from AAG Electr√≥nica and other hobby sensors.
 .
 This provides the capability to use a MySQL database for storage.
