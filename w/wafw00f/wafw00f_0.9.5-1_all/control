Description: identify and fingerprint Web Application Firewall products
 This package identifies and fingerprints Web Application Firewall (WAF)
 products using the following logic:
 .
  - Sends a _normal_ HTTP request and analyses the response; this identifies a
    number of WAF solutions.
  - If that is not successful, it sends a number of (potentially malicious)
    HTTP requests and uses simple logic to deduce which WAF it is.
  - If that is also not successful, it analyses the responses previously
    returned and uses another simple algorithm to guess if a WAF or security
    solution is actively responding to the attacks.
