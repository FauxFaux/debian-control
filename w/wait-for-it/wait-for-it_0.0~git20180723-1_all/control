Description: script that will wait on the availability of a host and TCP port
 wait-for-it is a pure bash script that will wait on the availability
 of a host and TCP port. It is useful for synchronizing the spin-up of
 interdependent services, such as linked docker containers. Since it
 is a pure bash script, it does not have any external dependencies.
