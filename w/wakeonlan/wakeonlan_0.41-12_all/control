Description: Sends 'magic packets' to wake-on-LAN enabled ethernet adapters
 With this package you can remotely wake up and power on machines which have
 motherboards or network cards that support 'Wake-on-Lan' packets.
 .
 The tool allows you to wake up a single machine, or a group of machines.
 .
 You need the MAC addresses of machines to construct the WOL packets, but,
 in contrast to 'etherwake', you do not need root privileges to use the
 program itself as UDP packets are used.
