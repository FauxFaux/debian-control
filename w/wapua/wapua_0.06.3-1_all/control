Description: Web browser for WAP WML pages
 wApua is a web browser for browsing WAP (Wireless Application
 Protocol) pages written in the Wireless Markup Language (WML;
 versions 1.1 and 1.2 are supported). Its main purpose is to test or
 surf WAP pages locally or over HTTP and HTTPS without connecting with
 a WAP capable mobile phone, which may be expensive or impossible,
 i.e. in case of WAP pages on the local filesystem.
 .
 wApua is written in Perl using libwww-perl and Perl/Tk.
 .
 Included in the package is the command line front-end wbmp2xbm to
 wApua's internal converter for decoding WAP Wireless Bitmaps (WBMP)
 into X Bitmaps (XBM).
