Description: light and fast launch bar
 Wbar is a quick launch bar. It's fast, light and cool eye-candy.
 It was initially developed for Fluxbox, then tested on WindowMaker, Xfce
 and GNOME 2 and it works very well with other window managers, too.
 It can run on top of desktops such as xfdesktop or Nautilus with the
 -above-desk switch.
