Description: HTTP testing tool and configuration-less HTTP server
 Wbox aims to help you having fun while testing HTTP related stuff.
 You can use it to perform many tasks, including the following.
  * Benchmarking how much time it takes to generate content
    for your web application.
  * Web server and web application stressing.
  * Testing virtual domains configuration without the need to alter
    your local resolver.
  * Check if your redirects are working correctly emitting
    the right HTTP code.
  * Test if the HTTP compression is working and if it is actually
    serving pages faster.
  * Use it as a configuration-less HTTP server to share files!
    (it's as simple as % wbox servermode webroot /tmp)
