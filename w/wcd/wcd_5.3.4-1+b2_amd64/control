Description: saves time typing when you want to change directories
 Wcd (Wherever Change Directory) is a program to quickly change directories.
 It saves time typing at the keyboard. One needs to type only a part of a
 directory name and wcd will jump to it. By default, wcd searches for a
 directory with a name that begins with what has been typed, but the use of
 wildcards is also fully supported.
