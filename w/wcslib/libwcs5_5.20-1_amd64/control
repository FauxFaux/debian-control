Description: Implementation of the FITS WCS standard
 WCSLIB is a C library, supplied with a full set of Fortran wrappers, that
 implements the "World Coordinate System" (WCS) standard in FITS (Flexible
 Image Transport System).
 .
 The FITS data format is widely used within the international astronomical
 community, from the radio to gamma-ray regimes, for data interchange and
 archive, and also increasingly as an online format.
 .
 This package contains what you need to run programs that use this
 library.
