Description: optional correlation data for weather-util search feature
 This package provides precomputed lookup tables used by the weather utility in
 the weather-util package when performing searches for proximal weather data.
 The included tables consist of great arc positional correlations between
 IATA/FAA (International Air Transport Association and USA Federal Aviation
 Agency) airport codes, ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization)
 weather station codes, NWS (USA National Weather Service) alert/forecast
 zones, FIPS (USA Federal Information Processing Systems) location codes, USA
 Census Bureau Gazeteer place names and ZCTAs (USA Census ZIP Code Tabulation
 Areas). These tables can also be automatically rebuilt from updated public
 sources using the weather utility in the weather-util package.
