Description: command-line tool to obtain weather conditions and forecasts
 This utility is intended to provide quick access to current weather conditions
 and forecasts. Presently, it is capable of providing data for localities
 throughout the United States of America and some select locations globally by
 retrieving and processing METAR data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
 Administration and forecasts from the National Weather Service.
 .
 The weather-util-data package is recommended to enable searches for nearby
 sources of weather data--otherwise you have to look up and build configuration
 for all the data source URIs yourself.
