Description: Development files for WebAuth authentication
 WebAuth is a cookie-based web authentication system built on top of
 Kerberos.  It relies on a central authentication server that handles all
 user authentication for a domain and creates user authentication
 credentials for any web server that needs strong authentication.
 .
 This package contains the symlinks, headers, and static library needed to
 compile and link programs that use libwebauth.
