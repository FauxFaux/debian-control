Description: Central login server for WebAuth authentication
 WebAuth is a cookie-based web authentication system built on top of
 Kerberos.  It relies on a central authentication server that handles all
 user authentication for a domain and creates user authentication
 credentials for any web server that needs strong authentication.
 .
 This package contains the CGI-based WebLogin server that handles initial
 user authentication and building authentication tokens for WebAuth
 servers.  Only one WebLogin server is needed to support a site WebAuth
 installation.  It is normally run on the same system as the WebKDC.
