Description: simple web server providing an HTTP interface to Redis
 Webdis is a simple web server providing HTTP interface to Redis. Some features
 include:
  * Support for GET and POST requests.
  * JSON output by default, optional JSONP parameter (?jsonp=myFunction).
  * Raw Redis 2.0 protocol output with .raw suffix
  * HTTP 1.1 pipelining (50,000 http requests per second on a desktop Linux
    machine.)
  * Restricted commands by IP range (CIDR subnet + mask) or HTTP Basic Auth,
    returning 403 errors.
  * Possible Redis authentication in the config file.
  * Pub/Sub using Transfer-Encoding: chunked, works with JSONP as well. Webdis
    can be used as a Comet server.
  * Custom Content-Type using a pre-defined file extension, or with
    ?type=some/thing.
  * URL-encoded parameters for binary data or slashes.
  * Logs, with a configurable verbosity.
  * Cross-origin XHR, if compiled with libevent2 (for OPTIONS support).
  * File upload with PUT.
  * With the JSON output, the return value of INFO is parsed and transformed
    into an object.
