Description: Small server for creating HTTP endpoints (hooks)
 Webhook is a lightweight configurable tool written in Go, that
 allows you to easily create HTTP endpoints (hooks) on your
 server, which you can use to execute configured commands. You
 can also pass data from the HTTP request (such as headers,
 payload or query variables) to your commands. webhook also
 allows you to specify rules which have to be satisfied in
 order for the hook to be triggered.
 .
 For example, if you're using Github or Bitbucket, you can
 use webhook to set up a hook that runs a redeploy script
 for your project on your staging server, whenever you push
 changes to the master branch of your project.
