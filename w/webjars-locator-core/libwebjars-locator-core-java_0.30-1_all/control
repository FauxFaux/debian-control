Description: WebJars Locator Core
 WebJars are client-side web libraries (e.g. jQuery & Bootstrap) packaged
 into JAR files. They allow one to:
  * Explicitly and easily manage the client-side dependencies in JVM-based
    web applications
  * Use JVM-based build tools (e.g. Maven, Gradle...) to download client-side
    dependencies
  * Know which client-side dependencies are used
  * Resolve transitive dependencies automatically and optionally load them
    via RequireJS
 .
 The WebJars Locator Core library provides a means to locate assets within
 WebJars.
