Description: Web framework for Python applications
 Web.py by Aaron Swartz offers a clean and well designed API for Python web
 applications.
 .
 The philosophy behind web.py is to: "Think about the ideal way to write a
 web app. Write the code to make it happen."
 .
 Implementations using this library have resulted in:
  * less code
  * code that ran faster
  * code that is easier to read and maintain.
 .
 This package provides the documentation.
