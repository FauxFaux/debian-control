Description: Combine maps and polygon data for astronomical image processing
 WeightWatcher is a program that combines weight-maps, flag-maps and polygon
 data in order to produce control maps which can directly be used in
 astronomical image-processing packages like Drizzle, Swarp or SExtractor.
 .
 Weight-thresholding and/or specific flag selections are applied by
 WeightWatcher through a configuration file: this alleviates other programs
 from such interpretation work. WeightWatcher will mostly be useful as part of
 an imaging survey pipeline. Its main features are:
 .
  * Processing speed: limited by the I/O performances of the machine
    (typically 50 Mpixel/s on a workstation),
  * Ability to work with very large images (up to, say, 10^8 Ã— 10^9 pixels on
    a 64 bit system),
  * FITS format (including Multi-Extension) is used for input and
    output. Output flag-map format selection is automatic (8, 16 or 32bits),
  * Up to 30 weight-maps, 30 flag-maps, and thousands of polygons can be
    handled simultaneously.
  * Automatic rasterizing of DS9 .reg files,
  * Statistics of flagged and weighted areas,
  * Metadata output in XML-VOTable format.
