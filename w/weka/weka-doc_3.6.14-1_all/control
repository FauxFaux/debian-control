Description: documentation for the Weka machine learning suite
 Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms in Java that can
 either be used from the command-line, or called from your own Java
 code. Weka is also ideally suited for developing new machine learning
 schemes.
 .
 Implemented schemes cover decision tree inducers, rule learners, model
 tree generators, support vector machines, locally weighted regression,
 instance-based learning, bagging, boosting, and stacking. Also included
 are clustering methods, and an association rule learner. Apart from
 actual learning schemes, Weka also contains a large variety of tools
 that can be used for pre-processing datasets.
 .
 This package contains the documentation.
