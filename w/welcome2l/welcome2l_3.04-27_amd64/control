Description: Linux ANSI boot logo
 This is a little program that may run at login time to produce nice
 ANSI login logo.
 .
 Welcome2L intends to produce  the best looking ANSI screens by making
 full usage of PC graphic characters.
 .
 Therefore an architecture able to display those characters (i386, Alpha with
 TGA adapter,... ) is required to use it.  And, even if it will work on larger
 screens, it will only produce 80 column ANSI screens.
