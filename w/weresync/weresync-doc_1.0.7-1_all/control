Description: incrementally clones running drives (documentation package)
 This package allows you to clone your drive to a target drive. It clones the
 drive incrementally, so after the first clone it will take a much shorter time.
 It provides both the "weresync" and "weresync-gui" commands, in order to run
 the program.
 .
 Why use WereSync?
 .
 WereSync is accessible to less-technical users. It comes with a simple
 interface and clone a drive with a single command while your computer is
 running. No booting to a live disk or pushing through a long initiation
 process. Unlike dd or CloneZilla, WereSync requires a low level of technical
 skill and has an easy learning curve
 .
 WereSync can run while the your main drive is being used, instead of blocking
 your computer up for hours at a time
 .
 WereSync will incrementally update clones, making subsequent clones much
 faster.
 .
 WereSync works quickly, a single command copies your entire drive, no booting
 to live CDs or managing MBRs.
 .
 WereSync can copy to a smaller drive, provided your drive's data will fit.
 .
 WereSync creates new UUIDs for the new partitions, allowing you to use the
 old and new drives alongside each other.
 .
 This is the documentation package.
