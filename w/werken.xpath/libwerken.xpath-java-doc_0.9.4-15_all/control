Description: JDOM XPath Engine - documentation
 A XPath Engine for JDOM, created by the Werken & Sons Company.
 .
 It's not overly useful by itself, but rather needs an (currently in
 development) implementation of XPointer, XSLT, or other XPath-based
 specification.  werken.xpath is merely an engine which can parse XPaths,
 and walk JDOM <http://www.jdom.org/> trees.
 .
 This package contains Javadoc HTML documentation for
 libwerken.xpath-java.
