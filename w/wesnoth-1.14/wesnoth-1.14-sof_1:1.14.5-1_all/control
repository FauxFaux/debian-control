 This package contains the "The Sceptre of Fire" campaign for Wesnoth:
  "The land of Wesnoth's banner bold
  Comes not from its own land;
  It comes from Dwarfdom, grim and old
  Made by a runesmith's hand.
  So now I tell from whence it came -
  The Fire-sceptre great -
  And of the makers of the same,
  Their tale I now relate..."
