Description: fantasy turn-based strategy game - complete suite (branch 1.14)
 This package depends on the complete set of packages built from the wesnoth
 source package but the server (which can be found in the
 wesnoth-1.14-server package), most helpful if you always
 want to have all the official campaigns installed.  If you only want to play
 over the network with other players or want to play only a few campaigns you
 just need to install the wesnoth-1.14-core package and
 the wanted campaign packages.
 .
 Battle for control of villages, using variety of units which have advantages
 and disadvantages in different types of terrains and against different types
 of attacks.  Units gain experience and advance levels, and are carried over
 from one scenario to the next in a campaign.
