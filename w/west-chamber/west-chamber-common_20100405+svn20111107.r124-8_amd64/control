Description: iptable extension for bypassing content filtering firewall
 West-chamber is an iptable extension named after the famous Chinese ancient
 fiction - Romance of the West Chamber. It is based on the idea of
 T. Ptacek's paper in 1998 which allows users go through some
 content-filtered firewall without 3rd-party proxies.
 .
 This package contains the extension for iptables. It needs corresponding
 kernel modules to work properly.
