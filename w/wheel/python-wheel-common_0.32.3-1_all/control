Description: built-package format for Python
 A wheel is a ZIP-format archive with a specially formatted filename and the
 `.whl` extension.  It is designed to contain all the files for a PEP 376
 compatible install in a way that is very close to the on-disk format.
 .
 The wheel project provides a `bdist_wheel` command for setuptools.  Wheel
 files can be installed with `pip`.
 .
 These are the command line scripts and manpages.
