Description: Automatically reconfigure your (laptop) system for a new location
 whereami is a set of useful scripts and a coordinating system for
 automatically re-locating your computer within the current (network)
 environment.
 .
 Typically, you would use whereami to automatically detect and
 re-configure your laptop when you move between a variety of diverse
 networks and/or docking environments.
 .
 Although whereami will work best if all of your networks assign
 addresses through dhcp, this is not a pre-requisite and the system
 allows any technique to be used to ascertain the new location with
 as little ongoing user intervention as possible.
 .
 Having ascertained the correct location, whereami will run appropriate
 (user-configured) scripts to adjust the laptop operation to suit the
 current environment.
 .
 See the man pages for more information.  You may also get useful
 assistance from the debian-laptop mailing list, which is
 frequented by several of the users and contributors.
