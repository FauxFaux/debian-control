Description: documentation for whitedune
 This package contains useful documentation for the whitedune VRML editor
 .
 VRML97 (Virtual Reality Modelling Language) is the ISO standard for
 displaying 3D data over the web.
 .
 VRML has support for animation, realtime
 interaction and multimedia (image, movie, sound). VRML97 can be written
 by popular programs like maya, catia, 3D Studio MAX, cinema4D, blender,
 wings3d and others, but (unlike whitedune) most of this programs support
 only a small part of the VRML97 features.
