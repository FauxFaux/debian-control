Description: Software verification platform
 Why3 is a platform for deductive program verification. It provides a
 rich language for specification and programming, called WhyML, and
 relies on external theorem provers, both automated and interactive,
 to discharge verification conditions. Why3 comes with a standard
 library of logical theories (integer and real arithmetic, Boolean
 operations, sets and maps, etc.) and basic programming data
 structures (arrays, queues, hash tables, etc.). A user can write
 WhyML programs directly and get correct-by-construction OCaml
 programs through an automated extraction mechanism. WhyML is also
 used as an intermediate language for the verification of C, Java, or
 Ada programs.
 .
 Why3 is a complete reimplementation of the former Why platform. Among
 the new features are: numerous extensions to the input language, a
 new architecture for calling external provers, and a well-designed
 API, allowing to use Why3 as a software library. An important
 emphasis is put on modularity and genericity, giving the end user a
 possibility to easily reuse Why3 formalizations or to add support for
 a new external prover if wanted.
