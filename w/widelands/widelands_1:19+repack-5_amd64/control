Description: fantasy real-time strategy game
 Widelands is a strategy game aiming for gameplay similar to Settlers II by
 BlueByte.
 .
 In this game, you start out on a small piece of land with nothing more than
 a few of useful resources. Using those, you can build yourself an empire
 with many thousands of inhabitants. On your way towards this goal, you will
 have to build up an economic infrastructure, explore the lands around you
 and face enemies who are trying to rule the world just like you do.
