Description: apply patches with conflicting changes
 Wiggle is a program for applying patches that 'patch' cannot
 apply due to conflicting changes in the original.
 .
 Wiggle will always apply all changes in the patch to the original.
 If it cannot find a way to cleanly apply a patch, it inserts it
 in the original in a manner similar to 'merge', and report an
 unresolvable conflict.
