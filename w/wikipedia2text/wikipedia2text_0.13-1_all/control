Description: displays Wikipedia articles on the command line
 This script fetches Wikipedia articles (currently supports around 30
 Wikipedia languages) and displays them as plain text in a pager or
 just sends the text to standard out. Alternatively it opens the
 Wikipedia article in a (possibly GUI) web browser or just shows the
 URL of the appropriate Wikipedia article.
