Description: applets for modules used by WIMS
 WIMS uses modules to implement every user interface beyond its main page.
 Some of them depend on Java applets; this package provides the collection
 of free applets which are maintained upstream.
 .
 Some interesting applets like Jmol are missing, since they still cannot
 be built from their source with free/libre compilers. You can get them
 from their upstream developers.
