Description: server for educational content: courses, exercises, and exams
 The WWW Interactive Multipurpose Server is an educational platform
 originally developed for mathematics but now also supporting subjects such
 as physics, chemistry, biology, and languages.
 .
 WIMS features a rich set of resources and exercises either for
 autodidactical use or for training classes, including:
 .
  * exercises with automatic feedback and correction, allowing the
    learners to work at their own pace;
  * interactive exercises with randomly assigned data, allowing the
    learners to work on the same type of exercise but with different
    data and as often as they wish;
  * exercises with an automatic scoring system, which enhances learner
    motivation;
  * user-friendly graphics and calculation tools;
  * courses and documents with hyperlinks to the exercise pool;
    examples in the courses can be made random, so the student can get
    more than one instance of an illustration for tricky concepts;
  * support for exams with pre-published contents. As each individual
    exam will have randomly chosen data, training is possible but
    writing each response in advance is not.
 .
 This package contains the WIMS FastCGI server, serving Open Exercise
 Format (OEF) documents. OEF is a very high-level language which
 allows authors to focus on pedagogical issues.
