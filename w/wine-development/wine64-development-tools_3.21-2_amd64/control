Description: Windows API implementation - 64-bit developer tools
 Wine is a free MS-Windows API implementation.
 This is still a work in progress and many applications may still not work.
 .
 This package provides Wine's 64-bit developer tools. They are capable of
 generating both 32- and 64-bit results.
