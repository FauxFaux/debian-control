Description: winff data files
 WinFF is a graphical user interface for FFmpeg or avconv. It will convert
 almost any video file that FFmpeg or avconv will convert. WinFF does multiple
 files in multiple formats at one time. You can, for example, convert
 mpeg's, flv's, and mov's into avi's (or DVD/VCD format or MPEG or 3gp
 etc.) all at once.
 .
 This package contains the shared files for the different WinFF flavors.
