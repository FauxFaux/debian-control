Description: Qt variant of winff
 WinFF is a graphical user interface for FFmpeg. It will convert
 almost any video file that FFmpeg will convert. WinFF does multiple
 files in multiple formats at one time. You can, for example, convert
 mpeg's, flv's, and mov's into avi's (or DVD/VCD format or MPEG or 3gp
 etc.) all at once.
 .
 Users usually want to install the winff package and let their package
 manager decide which winff variant to use. If you want to override the
 packager's choice, you can additionally select the required variant.
 This package provides the Qt variant of winff.
