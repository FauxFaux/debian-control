Description: Platform independent Python debugger
 Winpdb supports debugging of threads- and curses based applications,
 namespace modification and embedded debugging. As a remote debugger,
 it uses (encrypted) network connections to connect to the debuggee
 (which is running on the same machine, usually).
 .
 Winpdb is the graphical, wx-based frontend to rpdb2, which is also
 included in this package. rpdb2 is text based and able to use screen
 sessions if there is no x-terminal-emulator available.
 .
 Winpdb is up to 20 times faster than pdb.
