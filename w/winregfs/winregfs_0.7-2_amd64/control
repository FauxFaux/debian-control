Description: Windows registry FUSE filesystem
 Winregfs is a FUSE-based filesystem driver that enables accessing of Windows
 registry hive files as ordinary filesystems. Registry hive file editing can
 be performed with ordinary shell scripts and command-line tools once mounted.
 .
 fsck.winregfs scans a Windows registry hive file for problems that indicate
 the hive has been damaged by hardware or software issues, reading recursively
 the  key  and  value  data structures in the registry hive.
 .
 This package provides mount.winregfs and fsck.winregfs commands.
 Winregfs is useful for pentesters, ethical hackers and forensics experts.
