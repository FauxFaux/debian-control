Description: C++ library and application server for web applications [development]
 Wt (pronounced 'witty') is a C++ library and application server for
 developing and deploying web applications. The API is widget-centric
 and offers complete abstraction of any web-specific application details.
 .
 This package contains the development files for the Wt core library but you
 still need to install a connector, either the HTTP connector (libwthttp-dev),
 the FastCGI connector (libwtfcgi-dev) or the test connector (libwttest-dev).
