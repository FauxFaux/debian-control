Description: C++ library for webapps [devel] (transition package)
 Wt (pronounced 'witty') is a C++ library and application server for
 developing and deploying web applications. The API is widget-centric
 and offers complete abstraction of any web-specific application details.
 .
 This package installs development files for building software that uses the
 Wt libraries.
 .
 This is a dummy transition package and can be safely removed.
