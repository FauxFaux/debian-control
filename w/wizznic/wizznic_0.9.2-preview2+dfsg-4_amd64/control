Description: implementation of the arcade classic Puzznic
 As in the original game your mission is to clear the level of
 bricks. This is done by moving the bricks around. When two or
 more bricks of the same kind are next to each other or on top
 of each other they will disappear and points will be given.
 The level has to be clear of bricks before the time runs out
 or you will lose a life.
