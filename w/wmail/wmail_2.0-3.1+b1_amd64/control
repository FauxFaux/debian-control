Description: WindowMaker docklet watching your inbox
 wmail is a Window Maker docklet watching your inbox, which is either a
 ordinary mbox or a directory conforming to qmails Maildir format. It
 provides a nice little GUI displaying some useful pieces of information
 about your inbox (as many other nice wm-apps doing nearly the same
 thing...). Per default it uses the $MAIL environment-variable to locate
 the inbox you are using, other mailing mechanisms like POP or IMAP are
 not supported - use a tool like fetchmail to retrieve POP- or IMAP-based
 mail.
