Description: Window Maker's own widget set - utility library
 WINGs Is Not GNUstep (WINGs) is a small widget set with the NeXTSTEP
 look and feel. Its API is inspired in OpenSTEP and its
 implementation borrows some ideas from Tk. It has a reasonable set of
 widgets, sufficient for building small applications like a CDPlayer
 or hacking something like rxvt. It is used for basic widgets in
 the WindowMaker window manager.
 .
 This package contains the libWUtils runtime library.
