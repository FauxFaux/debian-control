Description: display laptop battery info, dockable in WindowMaker
 wmbattery displays the status of your laptop's battery in a small icon.
 This includes if it is plugged in, if the battery is charging, how many
 minutes of battery life remain, and battery status (high - green, low -
 yellow, or critical - red).
 .
 There's nothing in the program that makes it require WindowMaker, except
 maybe the look. It can be docked in WindowMaker or AfterStep's dock.
 .
 wmbattery supports multi-battery machines, and can estimate how long
 it will take the battery to finish charging or discharging.
