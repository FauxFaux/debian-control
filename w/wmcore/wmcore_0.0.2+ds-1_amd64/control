Description: Dockapp that shows the usage of each core in the system
 The dockapp splits into two displays, the upper one showing the common usage
 of the system and the lower display showing one graph per each core.
 .
 It detects the number of cores and computes the usage to be represented as a
 bar graph.
 wmcore works with a variable number of cores.  The display has been tested
 with 1 up to 16 (simulated) cores.
