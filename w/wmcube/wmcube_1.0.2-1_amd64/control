Description: spinning 3D object that shows the current CPU load
 wmcube is a dockapp that displays a realtime rotating 3D object which
 indicates  current CPU  load. The  higher  the load,  the faster  the
 object  spins. On  SMP  machines one  instance  can be  run for  each
 processor.
 .
 Originally wmcube could spin only a cube, hence the name.
