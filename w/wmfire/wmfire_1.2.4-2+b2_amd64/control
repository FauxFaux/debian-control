Description: very cool fiery way of showing your CPU usage
 A Window Maker (or similar) dockapp which shows your current CPU usage as
 a roaring fire.
 .
 It can monitor the average cpu load, or individual cpu load on SMP computers.
 Additionally it can monitor the memory, network load, a file or just be set to
 show a pretty flame. On entering the dock a burning spot replaces the cursor,
 and after two seconds symbols to represent the current monitor are "burnt"
 onscreen. The flame colour can also be changed.
 .
 It uses the GDK library to improve its speed - using less than half the CPU of
 the original program.
