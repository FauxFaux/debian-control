Description: program to monitor longrun status
 WMLongRun is a program to monitor LongRun. It displays the current
 LongRun(tm) settings and status: the frequency, the LongRun(tm) flags
 (performance or economy), and the performance level (expressed as a
 percentile). It is a dockapp (dockable application) that is supported by
 X window managers such as Window Maker, AfterStep, BlackBox, and
 Enlightenment.
 .
 It has two user interfaces: an LCD look-alike user interface and an
 LED-interface. If you select the LCD-interfaces, the back-light may be
 turned on/off by clicking the mouse button over the application.
