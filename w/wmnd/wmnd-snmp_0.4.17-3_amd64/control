Description: Dockapp monitoring network interfaces with SNMP support
 Shows a graph of incoming/outgoing traffic, activity indicators for rx/tx and
 current/maximum rate for rx/tx in bytes or packets.
 .
 The SNMP input driver can use any IF-MIB compliant data source such as
 most routers and managed switches.
 .
 Tailored for use with WindowMaker, it will as well work with any other window
 manager though.
