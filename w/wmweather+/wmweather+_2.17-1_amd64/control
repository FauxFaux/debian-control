Description: WindowMaker dock app that shows your current weather
 This provides a monitor on a 64x64 mini window that displays the
 current weather conditions, forecast data (US only), and optionally a
 radar image. It will also watch for various warnings and display them
 using an external command.
 .
 It is designed to work with the WindowMaker dock, but will work with
 other window managers as well. Think wmweather with a smaller font,
 forecasts, a weather map, and a sky condition display.
