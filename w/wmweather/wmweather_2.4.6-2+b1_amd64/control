Description: WindowMaker dockapp that shows your current weather
 wmweather provides a monitor on a 64x64 mini window that displays the current
 weather. The weather reports are received from NOAA's National Weather
 Service at http://www.nws.noaa.gov/, that is the same source that pilots use.
 .
 wmweather is designed to work with the WindowMaker dock, but will work with
 other window managers as well. xbase-clients are required for the left click
 to bring up the complete METAR record.
