Description: share files through HTTP protocol
 Woof (Web Offer One File) is a tool to copy files among hosts. It can serve a
 specified file on HTTP, just for a given number of times, and then exits.
 .
 It can be easily used to share files across the computers on a net, enough the
 other ends have just a browser (that means you can share things between
 different operating systems or different devices, even phones).
 .
 Features include:
  * it can share stuff "one shot" and exit just after he served that file.
  * it can share things among different operating system or different devices
    (e.g.: a smartphone), and allows one to upload files easily.
  * it can also show a simple html form in order to upload file (useful if the
    client hasn't a way to serve the file).
