Description: electronic lexical database of English language for dict
 WordNet(C) is an on-line lexical reference system whose design is
 inspired by current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical
 memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are organized
 into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexical
 concept. Different relations link the synonym sets.
 .
 WordNet was developed by the Cognitive Science Laboratory at Princeton
 University under the direction of Professor George A. Miller (Principal
 Investigator).
 .
 This package will be of limited use without the server found in the
 dictd package.
