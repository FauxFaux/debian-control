Description: WordNet lexicographer files processor
 WordNet(C) is an on-line lexical reference system whose design is
 inspired by current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical
 memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are organized
 into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexical
 concept. Different relations link the synonym sets.
 .
 WordNet was developed by the Cognitive Science Laboratory at Princeton
 University under the direction of Professor George A. Miller (Principal
 Investigator).
 .
 This package contains the grind processor for WordNet lexicographer
 files.  It can be used to process the lexicographer files from the
 Debian  source tarball into a WordNet binary database file or other
 lexicographer filese provided by the user.
