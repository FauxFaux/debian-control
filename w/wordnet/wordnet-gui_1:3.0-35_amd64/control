Description: electronic lexical database of English language (GUI)
 WordNet(C) is an on-line lexical reference system whose design is
 inspired by current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical
 memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are organized
 into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexical
 concept. Different relations link the synonym sets.
 .
 WordNet was developed by the Cognitive Science Laboratory at Princeton
 University under the direction of Professor George A. Miller (Principal
 Investigator).
 .
 WordNet is considered to be the most important resource available to
 researchers in computational linguistics, text analysis, and many
 related areas.
 .
 This package contains a Tcl/Tk Gui to browse wordnet dictionary.
