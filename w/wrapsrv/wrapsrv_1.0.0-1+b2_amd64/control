Description: DNS SRV record command line wrapper
 wrapsrv adds support for connecting to a network service based on DNS SRV
 record lookups to commands that do not support the DNS SRV record. wrapsrv
 implements the weighted priority client connection algorithm in RFC 2782.
 The specified command line will be invoked one or more times with %h and %p
 sequences in the command line substituted for the hostname and port elements
 of the selected SRV record.
