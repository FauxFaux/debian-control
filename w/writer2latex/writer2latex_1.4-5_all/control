Description: OpenOffice.org Writer/Calc to LaTeX/XHTML converter
 Writer2LaTeX is a java utility to convert OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice
 documents – in particular documents containing formulas – into other
 formats. It is actually a collection of four converters, i.e.:
  1) Writer2LaTeX converts documents into LaTeX 2e format for high quality
     typesetting.
  2) Writer2BibTeX extracts bibliographic data from a document and stores it in
     BibTeX format (works together with Writer2LaTeX).
  3) Writer2xhtml converts documents into XHTML 1.0 or XHTML 1.1+MathML 2.0 with
     CSS2.
  4) Calc2xhtml is a companion to Writer2xhtml that converts Calc documents
     to XHTML 1.0 with CSS2 to display your spreadsheets on the web.
