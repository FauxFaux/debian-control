Description: application designed to help students write more easily
 WriteType is a simple word processor designed to help young students write
 more easily and accurately. It offers spelling suggestions as students type,
 making the process easier and less frustrating. It also provides the ability
 to read back text through either an eSpeak or a Festival backend. In
 addition, there are special tools for teachers, and the entire application
 is easily translatable.
