Description: unobtrusively remove trailing whitespace in Emacs
 This package provides ws-butler-mode and ws-butler-global-mode.  Upon
 saving a file in Emacs, these modes delete trailing whitespace on
 lines of the buffer that have been edited.
 .
 As compared with simply calling delete-trailing-whitespace in your
 before-save-hook, ws-butler has the advantage of not cluttering up
 version control commits with whitespace cleanup outside of the part
 of the file you have edited.
