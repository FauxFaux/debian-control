Description: Documentation and examples for the WSJT-X package
 WSJT-X implements communication protocols or "modes" called FT8, JT4,
 JT9, JT65, QRA64, ISCAT, MSK144, and WSPR, as well as one called Echo
 for detecting and measuring your own radio signals reflected from the
 Moon. These modes were all designed for making reliable, confirmed QSOs
 under extreme weak-signal conditions.
 .
 This package provides the software documentation.
