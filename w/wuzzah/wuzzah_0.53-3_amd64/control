Description: inobtrusively monitor your friends
 The idea: you have friends on a system, and you want to know when they
 log on and off when you're logged on. what's more, maybe you're tired
 of throwing together crappy/clunky who(1)/w(1)/finger(1) commands in
 obfuscated shell/perl scripts that only half do the job anyway.
 .
 wuzzah is a program that selectively scans a system's utmpx records (where
 logins are stored, among other things), keeping an eye out for your friends
 logging in and out, taking customizable actions on events. wuzzah is small,
 fast, efficient, and written in C.
