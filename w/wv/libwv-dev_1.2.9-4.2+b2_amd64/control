Description: Development files for the wvWare library
 wvWare (previously known as mswordview) is a library that allows access
 to Microsoft Word files.  It can load and parse the Word 2000, Word 97,
 Word 95, and Word 6 file formats.  (Work is underway to support reading
 earlier formats as well: Word 2 documents are converted to plain text.)
 .
 This package contains the static library and header files.
