Description: intelligent Point-to-Point Protocol dialer
 WvDial sacrifices some of the flexibility of programs like "chat" in order
 to make dialup configuration easier. With WvDial,
 modems are detected automatically and only three additional parameters
 are required: the telephone number, username, and password. WvDial knows
 enough to dial with most modems and log in to most servers without any
 other help.
 .
 In particular, a "chat script" is not required to handle the most common
 situations.
