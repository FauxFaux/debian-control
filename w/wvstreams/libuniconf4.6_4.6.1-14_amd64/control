Description: C++ network libraries for rapid application development
 UniConf is a configuration system that can serve as the centrepiece among
 many other, existing configuration systems, such as:
  * GConf
  * KConfig
  * Windows registry
  * Mutt ;)
 .
 UniConf can also be accessed over the network, with authentication, allowing
 easy replication of configuration data via the UniReplicateGen.
