Description: C++ network libraries for rapid application development
 WvStreams is a library suite that is comprised of several parts.  Included
 in the extras package are:
  * WvIPStreams: which includes WvTCPStream and WvUDPStream
  * WvCrypto streams: a REALLY easy way to add SSL support to applications
 .
 These are the base classes used to build programs such as the ever popular
 WvDial, TunnelVision, FastForward, KWvDial, retchmail, and many more yet
 to come.  ;)
