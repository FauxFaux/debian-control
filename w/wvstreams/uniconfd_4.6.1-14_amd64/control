Description: Server that manages UniConf elements
 UniConf is a configuration system that can serve as the centrepiece among
 many other, existing configuration systems.
 .
 UniConf can also be accessed over the network, with authentication, allowing
 easy replication of configuration data via the UniReplicateGen.
 .
 This package contains the server that accepts incoming TCP or Unix
 connections, and gets or sets UniConf elements at the request of a
 UniConf client.
