Description: Python interface to the wxWidgets Cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit
 wxWidgets (formerly known as wxWindows) is a class library for C++ providing
 GUI components and other facilities on several popular platforms (and some
 unpopular ones as well).
 .
 This package provides a Python interface to the wxGTK library and the
 wxPython runtime support libraries.  This is the Phoenix reimplementation of
 wxPython.  NOTE: this package is not importable by default and is intended
 only for porting.  See README.Debian for more information.
