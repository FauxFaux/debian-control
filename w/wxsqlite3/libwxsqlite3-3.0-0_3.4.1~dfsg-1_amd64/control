Description: SQLite3 C++ wrapper for use in programs based on the wxWidgets
 wxSQLite3 is a C++ wrapper around the public domain SQLite 3.x database
 and is specifically designed for use in programs based on the wxWidgets
 3.0 library.
 .
 wxSQLite3 does not try to hide the underlying database, in contrary
 almost all special features of the current SQLite3 version 3.7.4 are
 supported, like for example the creation of user defined scalar or
 aggregate functions.
 .
 This package provides the shared libraries for use with wxWidgets 3.0 .
