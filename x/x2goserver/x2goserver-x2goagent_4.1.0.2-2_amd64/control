Description: X2Go Server's X2Go Agent
 X2Go is a software suite that uses NX technology for remote desktop
 computing.
 .
 NX technology implements a very efficient compression of the X11
 protocol. This increases performance when using X applications over a
 network, especially a slow one.
 .
 X2Go Agent functionality has been completely incorporated into NX
 agent's code base. If the nxagent binary is executed under the name of
 `x2goagent', the X2Go functionalities get activated.
 .
 This package is a wrapper that activates X2Go branding in nxagent.
 Please refer to the nxagent package's description for more information
 on NX.
