Description: Xapian simple example programs
 This package contains source code for some example programs which use the
 Xapian library.  The three "simple" examples are also included in binary
 form; binaries for the other examples can be found in the xapian-tools
 package (since they're useful tools in their own right).
 .
 The Xapian search engine library is a highly adaptable toolkit which allows
 developers to easily add advanced indexing and search facilities to their own
 applications.  It implements the probabilistic model of information retrieval,
 and provides facilities for performing ranked free-text searches, relevance
 feedback, phrase searching, boolean searching, stemming, and simultaneous
 update and searching.  It is highly scalable, and is capable of working with
 collections containing hundreds of millions of documents.
