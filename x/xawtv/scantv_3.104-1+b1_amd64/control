Description: television channel-scanner
 This package provides a utility that can scan a channel set for TV
 stations and write the ones found in an xawtv configuration file
 (which is also read by some other utilities such as fbtv). It
 attempts to extract the station names from inter-frame (VBI) data
 as well.
