Description: xbase compatible C++ class library (shared libraries)
 Xbase (formerly known as xdb, also formerly known as xBase) is a collection
 of specifiations, programs, utilities and a C++ class library for
 manipulating Xbase type datafiles and indices.
 .
 Xbase is useful for accessing data in legacy dBase 3 and 4 database files as
 well as a general light-weight database engine.  It includes support for
 DBF (dBase version 3 and 4) data files, NDX and NTX indexes, and DBT
 (dBase version 3 and 4).  It supports file and record locking under *nix
 OS's.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries necessary to run programs linked
 against Xbase.  For documentation, please install the libxbase64-dev package.
