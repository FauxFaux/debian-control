Description: Get rid of those Wingdows Viruses!
 Ever get the feeling that nothing is going right?  You're a sysadmin, and
 someone's trying to destroy your computers.  The little people running
 around the screen are trying to infect your computers with Wingdows [TM],
 a virus cleverly designed to resemble a popular operating system.  Your
 objective is to click the mouse on them, ending their potential threat.
 If one of the people reaches a computer, it will attempt to replace your
 operating system with the virus it carries. It will then attempt to run off
 the screen with your vital software.
