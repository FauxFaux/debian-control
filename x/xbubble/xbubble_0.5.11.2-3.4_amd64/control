Description: A nice Puzzle Bubble clone
 XBubble is a Puzzle Bubble / Bust-A-Move clone.
 .
 Your goal is to remove all the bubbles from the game board. To do this
 you must aim and shoot bubbles. When you manage to match 3 or more
 bubbles of the same color, they burst and disappear. All bubbles which
 hang free now, will fall down and disappear, too.
 .
 XBubble features single player mode, two player mode and
 player vs. computer (five difficulty levels of the AI) and has nice
 graphics, but no sound.
