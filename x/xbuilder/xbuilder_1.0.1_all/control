Description: Tool to cross-build a list of packages using sbuild, xdeb or pdebuild-cross
 This package contains scripts to run a batch-job of cross-builds,
 using various methods, on a list of source packages. It also has a
 simple cross-bootstraping helper (using build-profiles), and scripts
 for generating html tables summarising the results of a build run, and
 generating the packagelists to build.
 .
 It is not a proper buildd, or smart in any way, just really a
 collection of scripts wrtten for a particular task. Nevertheless they
 remain useful for this particular job.
