Description: XIM protocol implementation in XCB (development files)
 xcb-imdkit is an implementation of XIM protocol in XCB.
 Comparing with the implementation of IMDkit with Xlib and
 xim inside Xlib, it has less memory foot print, better performance
 and safer on malformed client.
 .
 It doesn't have complete protocol support though since some part of
 the protocol is never used.
 .
 This package provides development files of xcb-imdkit.
