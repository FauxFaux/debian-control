Description: utility libraries for X C Binding -- cursor, development files
 This package contains the header and library files needed to build software
 using libxcb-cursor, providing port of Xlib's libXcursor functions.
 .
 The xcb-util module provides a number of libraries which sit on top of libxcb,
 the core X protocol library, and some of the extension libraries. These
 experimental libraries provide convenience functions and interfaces which make
 the raw X protocol more usable. Some of the libraries also provide client-side
 code which is not strictly part of the X protocol but which have traditionally
 been provided by Xlib.
