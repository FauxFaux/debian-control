Description: This package is a Python binding for XCB (Python 3)
 This package is intended to be a (mostly) drop-in replacement for xpyb. xpyb
 has an inactive upstream, several memory leaks, is python2 only and doesn't
 have pypy support. xcffib is a binding which uses python-cffi, which mitigates
 some of the issues described above. xcffib also builds bindings for 27 of the
 29 (xprint and xkb are missing) X extensions in 1.10.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
