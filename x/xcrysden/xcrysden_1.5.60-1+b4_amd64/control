Description: Crystalline and Molecular Structure Visualizer
 XCrySDen is a crystalline and molecular structure visualisation
 program, which aims at display of isosurfaces and contours, which can
 be superimposed on crystalline structures and interactively rotated
 and manipulated. It can run on most UNIX platforms, without any
 special hardware requirements.
 .
 XCrySDen allows for real-time capture of display. Several movie encoders
 are supported, in particular for Animated-GIF convert (imagemagick),
 gifsicle, or whirlgif are necessary. For AVI/MPEG mencoder or
 ppmtompeg (netpbm) is required. For window dumps either imagemagick or
 xwd (x11-apps) needs to be present.
