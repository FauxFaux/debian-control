Description: Cross-build tool for Debian packages
 xdeb allows building a set of packages, using either native or cross
 compilation.  It is based on dpkg-cross and includes heuristics to map
 package names to the build or host architecture.
 .
 xdeb will build source packages from either APT or the current
 directory and can optionally convert existing natively built packages
 to satisfy build-dependencies.  It will also schedule builds in the
 proper order as specified in build-dependencies.
