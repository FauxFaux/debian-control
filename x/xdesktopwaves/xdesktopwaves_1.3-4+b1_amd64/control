Description: Simulation of water waves on the X Window System
 xdesktopwaves is a cellular automata setting the background of your
 X Window System under water. Windows and mouse are like ships on
 the sea. Each movement of these ends up in moving water waves. You
 can even have rain and/or storm stirring up the water.
