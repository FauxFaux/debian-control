Description: Library to read/write EEG data file formats (development files)
 xdffileio is a library that provides a unified interface for writing and
 reading various biosignal file formats in realtime (i.e. streaming). It has
 been designed to provide a flexible, consistent and generic interface to
 all supported file formats while minimizing the overhead the function
 calls: the heaviest operations (type casting, scaling and formatting) are
 offloaded into a separated thread. This design makes its particularly
 suitable to be directly used in a data acquisition loop (like in
 electrophysiology recording or in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)).
 .
 The genericity of the interface makes trivial various operations like
 transformation of a recorded file or its conversion to another file format.
 xdffileio currently supports EDF, BDF, GDF1 and GDF2 file formats and more
 will be added in future.
 .
 This package contains the files needed to compile and link programs which
 use xdffileio.
