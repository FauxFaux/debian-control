Description: Xenstore command line utilities for Xen
 This package contains command line utilities for interacting with
 XenStore.
 .
 XenStore is a shared database used for interdomain communication of
 configuration and status information.  It is accessible to all domains
 running on the same Xen host.  See http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/XenStore for
 more information.
 .
 In the common case these tools are used by the Xen toolstack running in
 domain0 (or a driver domain) however they may also be used in a guest
 domain to support local scripting which wants to communicate via XenStore.
