Description: Xenomai system tools utilities
 Xenomai is a real-time development framework cooperating with the Linux
 kernel in order to provide a pervasive, interface-agnostic, hard real-time
 support to user-space applications, seamlessly integrated into the GNU/Linux
 environment. Xenomai provides its own API and emulation layers ("skins") to
 make migration from other RTOS easier. Examples are: pSOS+, VxWorks, VRTX,
 uiTRON, RTAI, POSIX.
 .
 This package contains the runtime programs, testsuite for the Xenomai
 realtime system and system configuration scripts.
