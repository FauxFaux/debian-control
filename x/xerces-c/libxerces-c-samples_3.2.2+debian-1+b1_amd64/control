Description: validating XML parser library for C++ (compiled samples)
 Xerces-C++ is a validating XML parser written in a portable subset of
 C++.  This package contains compiled versions of the samples.  You
 probably don't want this package, but it can be useful if you are
 trying to reproduce a problem before reporting a bug that will be
 easy for the xerces developers to reproduce.
