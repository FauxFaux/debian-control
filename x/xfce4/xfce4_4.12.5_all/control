 It aims to be fast and lightweight, while still being visually appealing and
 easy to use.  Designed for productivity, it loads and executes applications
 fast, while conserving system resources.

 desktop environment and recommends some extra Xfce4 packages.  If you intend
 to use Xfce4 and want the full experience then installing this package and the
 packages it Recommends is a great place to start.
