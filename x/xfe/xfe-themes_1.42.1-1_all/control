Description: lightweight file manager for X11 (themes)
 Xfe is based on the popular but discontinued X Win Commander. It is
 desktop independent and is written using the C++ Fox Toolkit. Its
 appearance is similar to the Windows file-manager Total Commander
 or Windows Explorer. It is very fast and simple.
 .
