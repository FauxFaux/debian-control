Description: program for the design and analysis of subsonic airfoils
 XFOIL is an interactive program for the design and analysis of subsonic
 isolated airfoils. It consists of a collection of menu-driven routines
 which perform various useful functions such as:
   - Viscous (or inviscid) analysis of an existing airfoil
   - Airfoil design and redesign by interactive specification of
     a surface speed distribution via screen cursor or mouse
   - Airfoil redesign by interactive specification of new geometric
     parameters
   - Blending of airfoils
   - Drag polar calculation with fixed or varying Reynolds and/or
     Mach numbers.
   - Plotting of geometry, pressure distributions, and polars
