Description: 100 dpi fonts for X (transcoded from ISO 10646-1)
 xfonts-100dpi-transcoded provides a set of bitmapped fonts at 100 dots per
 inch.  In most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs)
 and/or an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package contains fonts in several ISO 8859 encodings: -2, -3, -4, -9,
 -10, -13, -14, and -15.  For the ISO 10646-1 and ISO 8859-1 encodings, see
 the xfonts-100dpi package.
 .
 This package and xfonts-75dpi-transcoded provide the same set of fonts,
 rendered at different resolutions; only one or the other is necessary, but
 both may be installed.  xfonts-100dpi-transcoded may be more suitable for
 large monitors and/or large screen resolutions (over 1024x768).
 .
 This package requires the xfonts-utils package to prepare the font
 directories for use by an X server or X font server.
