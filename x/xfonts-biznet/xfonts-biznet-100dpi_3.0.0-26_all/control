Description: 100 dpi BIZNET ISO-8859-2 fonts for X servers
 The BIZNET ISO 8859-2 (Central European) X Window System Fonts
 are a set of ISO 8859-2 (sometimes called also ISO Latin2)
 X Window System bitmap typefaces.
 .
 ISO-8859-2 character set is the ISO standard character encoding for the
 following languages: Albanian, Croatian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish,
 Slovak, Slovene, and Serbian.
 .
 xfonts-biznet-100dpi provides a set of bitmapped fonts at
 100 dots per inch.  In most cases it is desirable to have the
 X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package and xfonts-biznet-75dpi provide the same set of
 fonts, rendered at different resolutions; only one or the other is
 necessary, but both may be installed.  xfonts-biznet-100dpi
 may be more suitable for large monitors and/or large screen resolutions
 (over 1024x768).
