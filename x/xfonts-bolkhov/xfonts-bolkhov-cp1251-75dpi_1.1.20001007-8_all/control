Description: 75 dpi CP1251 encoded Cyrillic fonts for X (Cyr-RFX collection)
 This package provides a set of bitmapped Cyrillic fonts at 75 dots
 per inch.  These are CP1251 (microsoft-cp1251) fonts.
 In most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or
 an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 The fonts from this package are not designed for big monitors and/or
 large screen resolutions (over 1024x768).  You can find big fonts in
 the package xfonts-cronyx-cp1251-100dpi.
 .
 The fonts are modified (mainly with Cyrillics added) versions of the
 most important X-Window fonts from 75dpi/.
