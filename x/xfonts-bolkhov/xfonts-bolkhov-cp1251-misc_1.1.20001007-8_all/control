Description: Character-cell CP1251 encoded Cyrillic fonts for X (Cyr-RFX collection)
 This package provides a standard set of character-cell low-resolution
 Cyrillic fonts.  These are CP1251 (microsoft-cp1251) fonts.
 In most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or
 an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 The fonts are modified (mainly with Cyrillic added) versions of the
 standard X-Window fonts from misc/.  Upstream author: Dmitry
 Bolkhovityanov <bolkhov@inp.ins.su>
