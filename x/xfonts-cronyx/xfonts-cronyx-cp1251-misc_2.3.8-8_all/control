Description: Character-cell CP1251 encoded Cyrillic fonts for X (Cronyx collection)
 This package provides a standard set of character-cell low-resolution
 Cyrillic fonts.  These are CP1251 (microsoft-cp1251) fonts
 and support all current slavic Cyrillic scripts.
 In most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or
 an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.

 The upstream source of this package is the package Xcyr of Serge
 Winitzki.  Xcyr is a descendant of the package Xrus-2.3 of Andrey
 Chernov.
