Description: 75 dpi ISO 8859-5 encoded Cyrillic fonts for X (Cronyx collection)
 This package provides a set of bitmapped Cyrillic fonts at 75 dots
 per inch.  These are ISO 8859-5 fonts and support the Belarusian,
 Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian and Serbian scripts.  In most cases it
 is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or an X server
 installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package and xfonts-cronyx-isocyr-100dpi provide the same set of
 fonts, rendered at different resolutions; only one or the other is
 necessary, but both may be installed.  xfonts-cronyx-isocyr-75dpi may be
 more suitable for small monitors and/or small screen resolutions
 (under 1024x768).
 .
 The upstream source of this package is the package Xcyr of Serge
 Winitzki.  Xcyr is a descendant of the package Xrus-2.3 of Andrey
 Chernov.
