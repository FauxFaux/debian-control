Description: 100 dpi KOI8-R encoded Cyrillic fonts for X (Cronyx collection)
 This package provides a set of bitmapped Cyrillic fonts at 100 dots
 per inch.  These are KOI8-R fonts
 and are suitable for Russian.
 In most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or
 an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package and xfonts-cronyx-koi8r-75dpi provide the same set of
 fonts, rendered at different resolutions; only one or the other is
 necessary, but both may be installed.  xfonts-cronyx-koi8r-100dpi may be
 more suitable for large monitors and/or large screen resolutions
 (over 1024x768).
 .
 The upstream source of this package is the package Xcyr of Serge
 Winitzki.  Xcyr is a descendant of the package Xrus-2.3 of Andrey
 Chernov.
