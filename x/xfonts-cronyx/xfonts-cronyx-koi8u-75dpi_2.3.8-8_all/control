Description: 75 dpi KOI8-U encoded Cyrillic fonts for X (Cronyx collection)
 This package provides a set of bitmapped Cyrillic fonts at 75 dots
 per inch.  These are KOI8-U fonts
 and are suitable for Ukrainian.
 In most cases it is desirable to have the X font server (xfs) and/or
 an X server installed to make the fonts available to X clients.
 .
 This package and xfonts-cronyx-koi8u-100dpi provide the same set of
 fonts, rendered at different resolutions; only one or the other is
 necessary, but both may be installed.  xfonts-cronyx-koi8u-75dpi may be
 more suitable for small monitors and/or small screen resolutions
 (under 1024x768).
 .
 The upstream source of this package is the package Xcyr of Serge
 Winitzki.  Xcyr is a descendant of the package Xrus-2.3 of Andrey
 Chernov.
