Description: Character-cell Unicode Cyrillic fonts for X (Cronyx collection)
 This package provides a standard set of character-cell low-resolution
 Cyrillic fonts.  These are Unicode (ISO10646-1) fonts and support all
 current slavic Cyrillic letters as well as some Russian
 prerevolutionary letters.  In most cases it is desirable to have the
 X font server (xfs) and/or an X server installed to make the fonts
 available to X clients.
 .
 The upstream source of this package is the package Xcyr of Serge
 Winitzki.  Xcyr is a descendant of the package Xrus-2.3 of Andrey
 Chernov.
