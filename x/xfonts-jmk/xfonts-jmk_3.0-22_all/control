Description: Jim Knoble's character-cell fonts for X
 These are character-cell fonts for use with the X Window System, created
 by Jim Knoble.  The fonts currently included in this package are:
 .
 Neep (formerly known as NouveauGothic): A pleasantly legible variation on
 the standard fixed fonts that accompany most distributions of the X
 Window System.  Comes in both normal and bold weights in small, medium,
 large, extra-large, and huge sizes, as well as an extra-small size that
 only comes in normal weight.  ISO-8859-1, ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-9, and
 ISO-8859-15 encodings are available.  The 6x13, 8x15, and 10x20 sizes have
 an ISO-10646-1 (Unicode) variant, drawing glyphs missing in Neep from
 misc-fixed.
 .
 Modd: A fixed-width font with sleek, contemporary styling.  Normal and
 bold weights in a 12-point (6x13) size.  ISO-8859-1 encoding only.
