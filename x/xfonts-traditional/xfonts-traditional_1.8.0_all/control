Description: Traditional fixed-width fonts for X
 Provides "traditional" versions of fixed-width fonts.
 .
 These are a set of fonts (including 6x13 "fixed"), with foundry name
 "trad" instead of "misc", with several glyphs replaced with earlier
 versions from before Markus Kuhn's changes:
  - balanced  ` '
  - less tall  [ ] ( ) { }
  - centred  *
  - high  ~
  - slightly higher  &
  - traditional appearance of  W a
  - in 10x20, versions of ; : , . matching ` ' and each other
 .
 These changes make the fonts compatible with the US-ASCII character
 set.  (UTF-8 is not compatible with ASCII in its usage of the
 backquote and some other characters.)  With these fonts, pre-2000
 documents (including ASCII art and GNU manuals) will render
 correctly.
 .
 Additionally, we provide ASCII-compatible versions of several Neep
 fonts (replacing "jmk" with "trad.jmk" in the foundry name).
 .
 Optionally, this package will edit your system configuration to make
 the default fonts used by xterm refer to the traditional font.
 .
 (This package does not actually contain the bulk of the font data;
 rather, it automatically generates the required modified fonts for
 each relevant font you have installed.)
