Description: WenQuanYi Bitmap Song CJK font for X
 The Wen Quan Yi bitmap font is a manually fine-tuned multi-strike
 bitmap font for on-screen display of Chinese (traditional and simplified).
 It has arguably the most complete coverage for Chinese characters among
 all known open-source bitmap fonts, including CJK Unified Ideograph
 (U4E00 - U9FA5) and CJK Unified Ideograph Extension A (U3400 - U4DB5)
 glyphs at four different sizes (9pt-12x12 pixel, 10pt-13x13 pixel,
 11pt-15x15 pixel, 12pt-16x16 pixel) and two weights (medium and bold).
 .
 Use of this font in web pages and elsewhere eliminates the annoying
 "blurring" problems caused by the high stroke density of many Chinese
 characters and insufficient "hinting" of anti-aliased Chinese fonts.
 .
 This font also provides bitmap glyphs for Basic Latin,
 Japanese Hiragana (U3040 - U309F) and Katakana (U30A0 - U30FF).
