Description: Utilities for managing the XFS filesystem
 A set of commands to use the XFS filesystem, including mkfs.xfs.
 .
 XFS is a high performance journaling filesystem which originated
 on the SGI IRIX platform.  It is completely multi-threaded, can
 support large files and large filesystems, extended attributes,
 variable block sizes, is extent based, and makes extensive use of
 Btrees (directories, extents, free space) to aid both performance
 and scalability.
 .
