Description: A library for converting HTML into PDFs using ReportLab (Python 2 module)
 xhtml2pdf is a html2pdf converter using the ReportLab Toolkit, the
 HTML5lib and pyPdf. It supports HTML 5 and CSS 2.1 (and some of CSS
 3). It is completely written in pure Python so it is platform
 independent.

 and CSS is able to generate PDF templates very quickly without
 learning new technologies.

 xhtml2pdf was previously developed as "pisa".
 .
