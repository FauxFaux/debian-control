Description: Documentation for libcore-renderer-java
 Documentation for xhtmlrender that is an XML/CSS renderer,
 which means it takes XML files as input, applies formatting
 and styling using CSS, and generates a rendered representation
 of that XML as output. The output may go to the screen (in a
 GUI), to an image or to a PDF file.
 .
 The main target for content is XHTML 1.0 (strict), an XML
 document format that standardizes HTML. However,
 xhtmlrenderer accepts any well-formed XML for rendering as
 long as CSS is provided that tells how to lay it out.
 .
 In the case of XHTML, default stylesheets are provided out
 of the box and packaged within the library.
 .
 This package contains the javadoc files of
 libcore-renderer-java and the user guide reference for
 xhtmlrenderer.
