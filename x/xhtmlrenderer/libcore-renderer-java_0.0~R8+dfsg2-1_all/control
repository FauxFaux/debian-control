Description: Java library that provides an XML/XHTML/CSS 2.1 Renderer
 xhtmlrender is an XML/CSS renderer, which means it takes
 XML files as input, applies formatting and styling using
 CSS, and generates a rendered representation of that XML as
 output. The output may go to the screen (in a GUI), to an
 image or to a PDF file.
 .
 The main target for content is XHTML 1.0 (strict), an XML
 document format that standardizes HTML. However,
 xhtmlrenderer accepts any well-formed XML for rendering as
 long as CSS is provided that tells how to lay it out.
 .
 In the case of XHTML, default stylesheets are provided out
 of the box and packaged within the library.
