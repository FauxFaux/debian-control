Description: X color management daemon
 xiccd is a simple bridge between colord and X. It performs the following
 tasks:
 .
  * Enumerating displays and registering them in colord;
  * Creating default ICC profiles based on EDID data;
  * Applying ICC profiles provided by colord;
  * Maintaining the user's private ICC storage directory.
 .
 It does not depend on any particular desktop environment nor toolkit and it
 should not be used in desktop environments that support color management
 natively, like GNOME and KDE do.
