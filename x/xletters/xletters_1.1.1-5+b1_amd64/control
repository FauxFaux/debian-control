Description: Type falling words before they land
 A typing practice game for X similar to typespeed and tuxtype.
 Words chosen from the system's wordlist fall from the top of
 the screen and must be typed correctly to score.  In a challenge
 stage, random sequences of characters appear instead of words.
 Head-to-head networked play is possible with xletters-duel.
