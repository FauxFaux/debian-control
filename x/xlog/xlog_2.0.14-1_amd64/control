Description: GTK+ Logging program for Hamradio Operators
 xlog is a logging program for amateur radio operators which can be used
 for daily logging and contest. Logs are stored into a text file.
 .
 QSO's are presented in a list. Items in the list can be added, deleted or
 updated. For each contact, dxcc information is displayed and bearings and
 distance is calculated, both short and long path.
 .
 When hamlib is enabled through the menu, you can retrieve frequency, mode and
 signal-strength from your rig over the serial port.
