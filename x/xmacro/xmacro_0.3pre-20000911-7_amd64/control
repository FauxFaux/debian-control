Description: Record / Play keystrokes and mouse movements in X displays
 xmacrorec can be used to record mouse and keyboard events on any X11 display.

 xmacroplay can be used to playback recorded events or send any other
 mouse/keyboard events you choose. It is very handy for scripting an
 X display - for example controlling a presentation in mgp or ultrapoint
 from a script, network connection...

 xmacroplay-keys is a script to help use the above.
 .
 Together these utils can be used to record and replay sessions
 for demonstrations etc.
