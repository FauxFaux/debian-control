Description: tile-based solitaire game
 Xmahjongg is a simple implementation of the popular solitaire Mah Jongg game.
 The object is to remove all 144 tiles from the playing area by matching them
 two at a time. Xmahjongg is the classical version with little in the way of
 requirements and enough aesthetical and gameplay features to provide hours
 and hours of fun.
