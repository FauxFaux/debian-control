Description: program for visualizing atomic and molecular systems (OpenGL)
 XMakemol is a mouse-based program, written using the LessTif widget set, for
 viewing and manipulating atomic and other chemical systems.  It reads XYZ
 input and renders atoms, bonds and hydrogen bonds.
 .
 Features include:
  - Animating multiple frame files
  - Interactive measurement of bond lengths, bond angles and torsion angles
  - Control over atom/bond sizes
  - Exporting to Xpm, Encapsulated PostScript and XYZ formats
  - Toggling the visibility of groups of atoms
  - Editing the positions of subsets of atoms
 .
 This is the OpenGL-enabled XMakemol package. The images are rendered using
 true 3D graphics primitives, and can be exported using the Xpm format;
 red/blue stereo images can also be produced. The OpenGL package provides more
 display options, along with better support for displaying vectors. Ellipses
 can also be rendered.
