Description: Medical Image (DICOM, ECAT, ...) conversion tool
 This project stands for Medical Image Conversion. Released under the
 (L)GPL, it comes with the full C-source code of the library, a
 flexible command line utility and a neat graphical front-end using
 the GTK+ toolkit. The currently supported formats are: Acr/Nema 2.0,
 Analyze (SPM), DICOM 3.0, InterFile 3.3 and PNG.
 .
 The program also allows one to read unsupported files without
 compression, to print pixel values or to extract/reorder specified
 images. It is possible to retrieve the raw binary/ascii image arrays
 or to write PNG for desktop applications.
 .
 This is the command line tool for batch processing.
