Description: Emacs Lisp XML-RPC client
 This is an XML-RPC client library for Emacs Lisp, capable of both
 synchronous and asynchronous method calls.
 .
 An XML-RPC client sends and receives data over HTTP.  The request and
 the response are both described using XML.
 .
 xml-rpc.el represents XML-RPC datatypes as lisp values, automatically
 converting to and from the XML datastructures as needed, both for
 method parameters and return values.  This makes using XML-RPC
 methods transparent to the lisp code.
