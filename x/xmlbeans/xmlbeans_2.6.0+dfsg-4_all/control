Description: Java library for accessing XML by binding it to Java types - tools
 XMLBeans is a technology for accessing XML by binding it to Java types.
 .
 XMLBeans provides several ways to get at the XML, including:
  * Through XML schema that has been compiled to generate Java types that
    represent schema types. In this way, you can access instances of the
    schema through JavaBeans-style accessors after the fashion of "getFoo"
    and "setFoo". The XMLBeans API also allows you to reflect into the XML
    schema itself through an XML Schema Object model.
  * A cursor model through which you can traverse the full XML infoset.
  * Support for XML DOM.
 .
