Description: creates a common interface to use of the XML objects provided by IE and Mozilla
 The usage of XML inside the browser has been around for a while
 but not until lately has it been possible to get this to work
 in a satisfactory way in more than one browser. A while back
 Mozilla added support for creating MS compatible XML classes
 scriptable from JavaScript.
 .
 This script creates a common interface for Mozilla and IE
 and also extends the Mozilla classes a little to make
 them behave even more like the Microsoft interfaces.
