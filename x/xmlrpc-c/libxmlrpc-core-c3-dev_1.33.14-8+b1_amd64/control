Description: Lightweight RPC library based on XML and HTTP [C development libraries]
 XML-RPC is a quick-and-easy way to make procedure calls over the Internet.
 It converts the procedure call into an XML document, sends it to a remote
 server using HTTP, and gets back the response as XML.
 .
 This library provides a modular implementation of XML-RPC for C.
 .
 Install this package if you wish to develop your own programs using this
 library.
