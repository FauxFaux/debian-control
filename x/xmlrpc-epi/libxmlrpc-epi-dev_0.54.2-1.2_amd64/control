Description: Development files for libxmlrpc-epi0, a XML-RPC request library
 An implementation of the XML-RPC protocol, providing an API for developers to
 serialise RPC requests to and from XML. It does not include any transport layer
 and is therefor useful for applications which implement their own transport or
 wish to use XML-RPC over an existing transport layer. This package contains
 the development files for applications wishing to use libxmlrpc-epi.
