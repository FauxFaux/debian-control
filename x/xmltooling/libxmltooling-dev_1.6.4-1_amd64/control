Description: C++ XML parsing library with encryption support (development)
 The XMLTooling library contains generic XML parsing and processing
 classes based on the Xerces-C DOM. It adds more powerful facilities
 for declaring element- and type-specific API and implementation
 classes to add value around the DOM, as well as signing and encryption
 support.
 .
 This package contains the headers and other necessary files to build
 applications or libraries that use or extend the XMLTooling library.
