Description: C++ XML parsing library with encryption support (development)
 The XMLTooling library contains generic XML parsing and
 processing classes based on the Xerces-C DOM.  It adds more powerful facilities
 for declaring element- and type-specific API and implementation classes, as
 well as signing and encryption support.
 .
 This package contains the headers and other necessary files to build
 applications or libraries that use or extend the XMLTooling library.
