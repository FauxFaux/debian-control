Description: XMMS2 - Perl client library
 XMMS2 is a redesign of the XMMS music player. It features a client-server
 model, allowing multiple (even simultaneous!) user interfaces, both textual
 and graphical. All common audio formats are supported using plug-ins. On top of
 this, there is a flexible media library to organize your music.
 .
 This package contains the Perl library Audio::Xmmsclient that allows you to
 write XMMS2 clients. It's a language binding of libxmmsclient0.
