Description: XMMS2 - medialib-updater client
 The media library is where XMMS2 stores metadata about files as it plays them.
 Having a media library allows XMMS2 to 'remember' the songs it has played, and
 thus allows users to easily re-create their favorite playlists.
 .
 This package contains the medialib-updater client which monitors given
 directories and updates the media library with new and changed files.
