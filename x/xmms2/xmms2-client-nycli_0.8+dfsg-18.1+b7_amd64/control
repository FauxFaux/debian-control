Description: XMMS2 - new cli client
 XMMS2 is a redesign of the XMMS music player. It features a client-server
 model, allowing multiple (even simultaneous!) user interfaces, both textual
 and graphical. All common audio formats are supported using plug-ins. On top of
 this, there is a flexible media library to organize your music.

 This package contains only the symlink from nyxmms2 to xmms2. nyxmms2 was
 renamed to xmms2 in 0.8 DrO_o.
