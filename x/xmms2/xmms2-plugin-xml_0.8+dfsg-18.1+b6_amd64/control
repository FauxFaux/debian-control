Description: XMMS2 - XML plug-in
 XMMS2 is a redesign of the XMMS music player. It features a client-server
 model, allowing multiple (even simultaneous!) user interfaces, both textual
 and graphical. All common audio formats are supported using plug-ins. On top of
 this, there is a flexible media library to organize your music.
 .
 This package allows XMMS2 to read XML based formats. This package is used by
 other plug-ins that implement support for specific XML formats like
 xmms2-plugin-xspf and xmms2-plugin-rss.
