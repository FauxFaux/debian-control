Description: Client/server based media player system
 XMMS2 is a redesign of the XMMS music player. It features a client-server
 model, allowing multiple (even simultaneous!) user interfaces, both textual
 and graphical. All common audio formats are supported using plug-ins. On top of
 this, there is a flexible media library to organize your music.
 .
 This package is a metapackage depending on various other XMMS2 packages.
 Installing this package gets you a command line client and enables XMMS2
 playback of Ogg Vorbis and MP3 files from local and remote sources.
