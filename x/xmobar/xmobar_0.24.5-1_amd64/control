Description: lightweight status bar for X11 window managers
 xmobar is a lightweight text-based status bar for X11 desktops written in
 Haskell and designed to work with (but not limited to) xmonad. It has a
 variety of plugins allowing the display of system-related data and an
 extensible architecture that makes it easy to write one's own plugins. xmobar
 supports displaying UTF-8 text and using TrueType fonts via Xft.
