Description: digital image warp and morph, examples
 gtkmorph loads, saves, warps, and dissolves images, and loads, saves,
 creates, and manipulates control meshes which determine the warping.  It has
 support for making movies automatically (it needs extra packages).  The
 technique was invented and first used by Industrial Light and Magic, and is
 commonly called "morphing."
 .
 This package contains an example session, that can be used also with xmorph.
