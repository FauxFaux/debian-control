Description: Digital image warp and morph (gtk)
 gtkmorph loads, saves, warps, and dissolves images, and loads, saves,
 creates, and manipulates control meshes which determine the warping.   The
 technique was invented and first used by Industrial Light and Magic, and is
 commonly called "morphing."
 .
 gtkmorph is a GUI for libmorph, using GTK+.  It has many features, as the
 support for making movies automatically (it needs extra packages).
