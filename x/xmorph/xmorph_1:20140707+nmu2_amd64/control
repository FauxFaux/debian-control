Description: digital image warp and morph (x11)
 Xmorph loads, saves, warps, and dissolves images, and loads, saves, creates,
 and manipulates control meshes which determine the warping.  The technique
 was invented and first used by Industrial Light and Magic, and is commonly
 called "morphing".
 .
 Xmorph uses the Targa image format exclusively.  Other software is needed to
 convert to other image formats or to movies.  (Due to a bug, Xmorph's images
 are unreadable by John Bradley's XV.)
 .
 xmorph is a GUI for libmorph, using the X Toolkit; the package also contains
 a text-only program called morph.
