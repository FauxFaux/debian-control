Description: Graphical user interface for MPI program development
 MPI is a standard for writing parallel processing programs using
 a well defined Message Passing Interface.
 .
 XMPI can acquire and display extensive detail on an application's MPI
 communication, including the following:
  o process synchronization status: running, system or blocked
  o message queue contents
  o source, destination, root ranks
  o MPI function name
  o communicator
  o data type
  o message count
  o tag
 The above information is acquired from on-demand snapshots of
 application status using debugging hooks in the MPI implementation or
 from a trace log of communication activity.
