Description: Documentation for the libxom-java package
 XOM(tm) is a new XML object model. It is an open source (LGPL),
 tree-based API for processing XML with Java that strives for correctness,
 simplicity, and performance, in that order.
 .
 XOM is designed to be easy to learn and easy to use. It works very
 straight-forwardly, and has a very shallow learning curve. Assuming
 you're already familiar with XML, you should be able to get up and
 running with XOM very quickly.
 .
 XOM is the only XML API that makes no compromises on correctness.
 XOM only accepts namespace well-formed XML documents, and only allows
 you to create namespace well-formed XML documents. (In fact, it's a
 little stricter than that: it actually guarantees that all documents
 are round-trippable and have well-defined XML infosets.) XOM manages
 your XML so you don't have to. With XOM, you can focus on the unique
 value of your application, and trust XOM to get the XML right.
 .
 This package includes the API documentation for libxom-java package.
