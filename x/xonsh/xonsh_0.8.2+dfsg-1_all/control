Description: Python-powered, cross-platform, Unix-gazing shell
 Xonsh is a Python-ish shell language and command prompt. Unlike other shells,
 xonsh is based on Python, with additional syntax added that makes calling
 subprocess commands, manipulating the environment, and dealing with the file
 system easy. Xonsh supports all normal Python constructs and a subset of
 those available in bash.
