Description: miscellaneous X clients - metapackage
 An X client is a program that interfaces with an X server (almost always via
 the X libraries), and thus with some input and output hardware like a
 graphics card, monitor, keyboard, and pointing device (such as a mouse).
 .
 This package provides a miscellaneous assortment of several dozen X clients
 that ship with the X Window System.
 .
 This package is provided for transition from earlier Debian releases, the
 programs formerly in xutils and xbase-clients having been split out in smaller
 packages.
