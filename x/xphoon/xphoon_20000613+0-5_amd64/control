Description: sets the root window to a picture of the moon
 xphoon sets the X root window to a picture of the moon in its current
 phase, including the partial lighting of the dark side by reflected
 earthlight. Picture is a monochrome dithered bitmap which is calculated
 via mathematical formulae. It keeps running on background updating the
 picture accordingly as time goes by.
