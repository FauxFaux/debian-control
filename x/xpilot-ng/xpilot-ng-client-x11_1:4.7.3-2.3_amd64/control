Description: Client for XPilot NG
 XPilot is a multi-player tactical manoeuvring game for X.  Each
 player controls their own fighter equipped with a variety of weapons
 and power-ups.  Players compete as teams or as individuals;  the
 object of the game is to score points by blasting the opposition,
 stealing their treasure or by racing round a circuit.
 WARNING: This game is very addictive.
 .
 This package contains the classic client needed to play the game.
 Because it is X11-based, it has a very basic, clean look-and-feel,
 and is suitable for use on older, less powerful systems.
