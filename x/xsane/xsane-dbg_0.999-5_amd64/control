Description: featureful graphical frontend for SANE (Debug files)
 xsane can be run as a stand-alone program or through the GIMP image
 manipulation program.  In stand-alone mode, xsane can save an image
 to a file in a variety of image formats, serve as a frontend to a
 fax program, or send an image to a printer.
 .
 SANE stands for "Scanner Access Now Easy" and is an application
 programming interface (API) that provides standardized access to any
 raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner,
 video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). The SANE standard is
 free and its discussion and development are open to everybody. The
 current source code is written to support several operating systems,
 including GNU/Linux, OS/2, Win32 and various Unices and is available
 under the GNU General Public License (commercial applications and
 backends are welcome, too, however).
 .
 This package contains debug files needed by xsane.
