Description: X.Org X server -- mouse input driver
 This package provides the driver for mouse input devices.  It is mainly used
 on non-Linux operating systems such as BSD and Solaris. Most
 configurations on Linux will use evdev, the kernel's event delivery
 mechanism, and do not need this package.
 .
 See the inputattach package if your mouse is not automatically
 detected by the Linux kernel, for example because it is a serial mouse.

 This package is built from the X.org xf86-input-mouse driver module.
