Description: X.Org X server -- VESA display driver
 This driver for the X.Org X server (see xserver-xorg for a further description)
 uses the standard VESA interface provided on all video cards, but runs
 unaccelerated.  This driver is not recommended for use unless you have a
 problem with the normal driver for your card, because it will perform very
 badly.
