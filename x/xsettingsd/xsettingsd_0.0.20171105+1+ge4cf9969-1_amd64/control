Description: Provides settings to X11 applications
 xsettingsd is a daemon that implements the XSETTINGS specification.
 It is intended to be small, fast, and minimally dependent on other
 libraries. It can serve as an alternative to gnome-settings-daemon
 for users who are not using the GNOME desktop environment but who
 still run GTK+ applications and want to configure things such as
 themes, font antialiasing/hinting, and UI sound effects.
