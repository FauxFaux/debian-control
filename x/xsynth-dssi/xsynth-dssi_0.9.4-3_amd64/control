Description: classic-analog (VCOs-VCF-VCA) style software synthesizer
 The xsynth-dssi  package contains the Xsynth-DSSI plugin, a classic-analog
 (VCOs-VCF-VCA) style software synthesizer with an editor GUI. Xsynth-DSSI was
 written by Sean Bolton, and was based on Steve Brooke's Xsynth code, but has
 since acquired polyphonic operation, band-limited oscillators, a better
 filter mode, and velocity-sensitive envelopes.
 .
 DSSI is an API for audio processing plugins, particularly useful for software
 synthesis plugins with user interfaces.
