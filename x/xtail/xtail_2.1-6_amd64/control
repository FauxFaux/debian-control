Description: like "tail -f", but works on truncated files, directories, more
 xtail watches the growth of files.  It's like running a "tail -f" on
 a bunch of files at once.  It notices if a file is truncated and starts
 from the beginning.  You can specify both filenames and directories on
 the command line.  If you specify a directory, it watches all the files
 in that directory.  It will notice when new files are created (and
 start watching them) or when old files are deleted (and stop watching
 them).
 .
 Note that xtail isn't a graphical (X11) program, it runs on a plain tty.
 The name likely comes from "eXtended tail" or such.
