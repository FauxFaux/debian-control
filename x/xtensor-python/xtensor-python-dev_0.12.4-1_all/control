Description: Python bindings for the xtensor library
 xtensor is a C++ library for multi-dimensional arrays enabling numpy-style
 broadcasting and lazy computing.
 .
 xtensor-python enables inplace use of numpy arrays in C++ with all the
 benefits from xtensor:
 .
   - C++ universal function and broadcasting
   - STL - compliant APIs.
   - A broad coverage of numpy APIs (see the numpy to xtensor cheat sheet).
 .
 The Python bindings for xtensor are based on the pybind11 C++ library, which
 enables seemless interoperability between C++ and Python.
 .
 This package provides the header-only library.
