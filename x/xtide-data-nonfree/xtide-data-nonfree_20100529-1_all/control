Description: Harmonics data for xtide (Canada, Netherlands, Germany and UK)
 XTide is a package that provides tide and current predictions in a wide
 variety of formats. Graphs, text listings, and calendars can be generated,
 or a tide clock can be provided on your desktop.
 .
 This package provides _extra_ harmonic station data for the xtide package.
 XTide works fine without them using the (free) xtide-data package which
 provides harmonics data for the US, but this package adds non-free data
 for Canada, the Netherlands, Germany and the UK.
 .
 This package is non-free because commercial distribution of the data is
 not allowed.
