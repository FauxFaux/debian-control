Description: Reads and writes crossword puzzles in the Across Lite file format
 Xword is a GTK+ program that works well for doing crossword puzzles in the
 Across Lite file format used by The New York Times and others. As well as a
 clock, it supports printing. It also auto-saves puzzles as you solve them so
 that you can return to partially completed puzzles.
