Description: display write and wall messages as desktop notifications
 The xwrited utility displays write(1) and wall(1) messages as desktop
 notifications. A notification daemon compliant to the freedesktop.org
 Desktop Notification Specification draft needs to be running in order
 to display the notifications.
 .
 This utility is useful e.g. to send (forward) broadcast (wall) messages
 to all users from cronjobs or system daemons.
 .
 The xwrited daemon is automatically started for each new X session
 after the installation of this package.
