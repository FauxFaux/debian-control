Description: graphical file/directory comparison and merge tool - scripts
 xxdiff is a powerful tool for viewing the differences between two or three
 files, or two directories, and can be used to produce a merged version.  The
 texts of the two or three files are presented side by side with their
 differences highlighted with colors for easy identification.
 .
 This package provides a number of scripts that are used to perform a variety of
 tasks that all involve getting user verification and feedback using the xxdiff
 graphical differences viewer.
 .
 For example, there are scripts to perform global renaming of strings within a
 large codebase, where each transformed file is viewed by the user with an
 xxdiff, accepted, rejected or merged changes written over the original file
 (making backups is supported).  Also, this infrastructure is mostly provided as
 modules, in order to allow users to write file transformations in Python and to
 leverage this interactive confirmation process.
 .
 There are also scripts that visualize diffs for a number of SCM systems, like
 CVS, Subversion, etc.  This package was born after a number of these useful
 scripts had sprouted, and it became apparent that sharing the common code for
 the scripts would be a great advantage to tools writers.
 .
