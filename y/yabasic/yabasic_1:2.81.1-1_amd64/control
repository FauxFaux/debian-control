Description: Yet Another BASIC interpreter
 yabasic implements the most common and simple elements of the BASIC
 language; it comes with for-loops and goto with while-loops and
 procedures.  yabasic does monochrome line graphics, and printing
 comes with no extra effort.  yabasic runs under Unix and Windows;
 it is small (less than 200 KB) and free.
