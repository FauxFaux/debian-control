 Yet Another Computer Algebra System is a small and highly
 flexible computer algebra language.

 The syntax is very close to Mathematica. The distribution contains
 a small library of mathematical functions, but its real strength
 is in the language in which you can easily write your own symbolic
 manipulation algorithms. It supports arbitrary precision arithmetic.
