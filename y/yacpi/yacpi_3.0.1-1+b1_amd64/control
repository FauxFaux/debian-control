Description: ncurses based acpi monitor for text mode
 yacpi (yet another configuration and power interface) is an ncurses based
 ACPI monitoring program for notebooks. There is also a text-only output
 so it is possible to include it in scripts.
 It displays various ACPI information like battery status, temperature,
 charging circuits and AC status.
 Additionally it displays CPU governor and current frequency.
