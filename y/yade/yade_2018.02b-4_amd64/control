Description: Platform for discrete element modeling
 Yet Another Dynamic Engine.
 .
 Extensible open-source framework for discrete numerical models,
 focused on Discrete Element Method.
 The computation parts are written in c++ using flexible object model,
 allowing independent implementation of new algorithms and interfaces.
 Python is used for rapid and concise scene construction,
 simulation control, postprocessing and debugging.
 .
 This package contains speed-optimized build of yade.
