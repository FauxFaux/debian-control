Description: development libraries and header files for YADIFA
 YADIFA is a lightweight authoritative Name Server with DNSSEC capabilities.
 Developed by the passionate people behind the .eu top-level domain, YADIFA
 has been built from scratch to face today's DNS challenges, with no
 compromise on security, speed and stability, to offer a better and safer
 Internet experience. YADIFA has a simple configuration syntax and can handle
 more queries per second while maintaining one of the lowest memory footprints
 in the industry. YADIFA also has one of the fastest zone file load times
 ever recorded on a name server.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static libraries needed for
 developing applications for YADIFA. It is currently only used by YADIFA
 itself and should not be considered stable.
