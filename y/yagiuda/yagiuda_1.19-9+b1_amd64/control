Description: software to analyse performance of Yagi-Uda antennas
 You give the dimensions and positions of each element, and the
 program calculates gain, input impedance, front-to back ratio,
 beam-patterns etc. An optimisation program 'optimise' tries to
 optimise a design. The optimiser can also tell you the sensitivity
 of a good design, to small mechanical errors.
