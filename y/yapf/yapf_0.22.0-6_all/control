Description: Python code formatter for different styles (Python 2)
 Yapf is a tool that reformats code to the best formatting that conforms to the

 styilistic appearance of Python code. The idea is also similar to the 'gofmt'
 tool for the Go programming language. This package installs the tool for Python
