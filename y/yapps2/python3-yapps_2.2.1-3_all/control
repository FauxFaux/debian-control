Description: Yet Another Python Parser System
 YAPPS is an easy to use parser generator that is written in Python and
 generates Python code.  There are several parser generator systems
 already available for Python, but this parser has different goals:
 Yapps is simple, very easy to use, and produces human-readable parsers.
 .
 This package contains the Python3 runtime support for parsers generated
 with yapps2.
