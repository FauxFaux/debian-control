Description: Yet Another Parser Generator for Python
 Yappy provides a lexical analyser and a LR parser generator
 for Python applications. It currently builds SLR,
 LR(1) and LALR(1) tables. Tables are kept in Python shelves for use
 in parsing.  Some ambiguous grammars can be handled if priority
 and associativity information is provided.
