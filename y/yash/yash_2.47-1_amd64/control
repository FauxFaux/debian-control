Description: yet another shell
 Yash is a command line shell that conforms to the POSIX.1 (IEEE Std
 1003.1, 2008 Edition) standard for the most part. Actually, it is much
 more POSIX-compliant than other shell like bash and zsh.
 .
 Yash also has its own features beyond POSIX, such as:
   * global aliases
   * random numbers
   * socket redirections and other special redirections
   * right prompt
   * command completion
