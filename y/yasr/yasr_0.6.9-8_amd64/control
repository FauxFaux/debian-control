Description: General-purpose console screen reader
 Yasr is a general-purpose console screen reader for GNU/Linux and
 other Unix-like operating systems.  The name "yasr" is an acronym that
 can stand for either "Yet Another Screen Reader" or "Your All-purpose
 Screen Reader".
 .
 Currently, yasr attempts to support the Speak-out, DEC-talk, BNS, Apollo,
 and DoubleTalk synthesizers.  It is also able to communicate with
 Emacspeak servers and can thus be used with synthesizers not directly
 supported, such as Festival Lite (via eflite) or FreeTTS.
 .
 Yasr is written in C and works by opening a pseudo-terminal and running a
 shell, intercepting all input and output.  It looks at the escape
 sequences being sent and maintains a virtual "window" containing what
 it believes to be on the screen.  It thus does not use any features
 specific to Linux and can be ported to other Unix-like operating
 systems without too much trouble.
