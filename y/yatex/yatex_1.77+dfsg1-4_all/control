Description: Yet Another TeX mode for Emacs
 YaTeX is an intelligent, acquisitive and integrated package which reduces
 your efforts of composing LaTeX source on Emacs.
 .
 YaTeX automates typesetting and previewing of LaTeX and enables
 completing input of LaTeX mark-up command such as `\begin{}'..`\end{}'.
 .
 This package also includes yahtml mode, the honest and bright YaTeX-compatible
 major-mode for writing HTML. If you have noticed the power of YaTeX, you can
 drive yahtml over the HTML files quickly and steadily. And vice versa, of
 course.
 .
 YaTeX also supports Demacs which runs on MS-DOS(386), Mule
 (Multi Language Enhancement to GNU Emacs), and LaTeX on DOS.
 .
