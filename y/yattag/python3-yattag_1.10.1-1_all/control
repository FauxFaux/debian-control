Description: library for generating HTML or XML in a pythonic way (Python 3)
 With Yattag,
 .
  * you don't have to worry about closing HTML tags
  * your HTML templates are Python code. Not a weird template language. Just
    Python.
  * you can easily render HTML forms, with defaults values and error messages.
 .
 It's actually easier and more readable to generate dynamic HTML with Yattag
 than to write static HTML.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of yattag.
