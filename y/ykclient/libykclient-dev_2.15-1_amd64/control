Description: Yubikey client library development files
 YubiKeys are USB tokens that act like keyboards and generate one-time
 passwords (OTPs).  The tokens are produced and sold by Yubico.

 This package contains the necessary files for developers, and a
 command line tool "ykclient" to perform OTP queries from the shell.
