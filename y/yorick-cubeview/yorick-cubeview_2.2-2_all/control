Description: 3D FITS data viewer specialized in spectro-imaging
 Cubeview is a viewer for 3D data store in FITS files, a file format
 extensively used among astronomers. It is specialized in displaying
 spectro-imaging data but can be used to do basic visualization on any
 FITS file containing a 3D array.
 .
 Cubeview features a stand-alone graphical user interface which
 adheres to the GTK+ look-and-feel. Being written in
 Yorick, it is inherently scriptable. A system of hooks allows custom
 actions to be repeated automatically when certain events occur.
