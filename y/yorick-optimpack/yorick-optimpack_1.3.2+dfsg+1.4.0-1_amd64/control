Description: optimization of large scale problems for the Yorick language
 OptimPack is a portable C library which implements algorithms for
 optimization of large scale problems with bound constraints. Large
 scale means some million variables (e.g. pixel values) or more.
 .
 The most important algorithm is VMLM-B: a variable metric method with
 limited memory requirements and, possibly, bound constraints on the
 parameters. The algorithm is based on limited memory BFGS updates
 with Mor√© & Thuente inexact line search and gradient projection to
 account for bounds.
 .
 This package contains two Yorick plug-ins: one based on the newer
 OptimPackLegacy version and, for backward compatibility, one based on the
 previous OptimPack1 implementation.
