Description: FITS image display and simple analysis
 Spydr (pronounced like spider) basically is an FITS image viewer. It
 can work as a stand-alone application but is best integrated in a
 Yorick-based data-analysis work-flow (Yorick is an interpreted
 language specialized in numerical computations and scientific
 graphics). It includes tools to zoom, produce cuts, histograms,
 Gaussian/Moffat fits, PSF fits (inc. FWHM and Strehl). Can work on
 single images, sequences of images or data cubes.
