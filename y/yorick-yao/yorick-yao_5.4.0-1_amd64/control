Description: Yorick-based adaptive optics system simulator
 Yao is a monte-carlo simulation package for adaptive optics. It can
 be used stand-alone through a GTK-based integrated graphical user
 interface or as a Yorick language extension. Yao features:
   * Shack-Hartmann and Curvature WFS, on or off axis;
   * support for Stackarray (piezostack), curvature (bimorph), modal
     (zernike) and Tip-Tilt deformable mirrors. The altitude of
     conjugation is adjustable;
   * arbitrary number of WFSs and DMs, with the possibility of mixing
     types. It is therefore possible (and easy) to simulate single DM
     systems, as well as single non-zero conjugate, GLAO and MCAO
     systems;
   * support for Natural and Laser Guide Stars (or a mix), WFS with
     photon and read-out noise;
   * multi-layered atmospheric model with geometrical propagation
     only;
   * speed-optimized loop: critical routines have been coded in C.
