Description: documentation for the Yorick interpreted language
 Yorick is an interpreted programming language for:
  * scientific simulations or calculations
  * postprocessing or steering large simulation codes
  * interactive scientific graphics
  * reading, writing, and translating large files of numbers
 .
 The Yorick package ships with little documentation: a manpage, the
 Yorick Manual in info format, and its own "help" command. This
 package adds the Yorick Manual and Quick Reference in PDF and HTML
 format and a utility (update-yorickdoc) to build HTML documentation
 for the set of functions (from Yorick and add-on packages) installed
 on this machine. By default, these pages are built and updated
 automatically whenever necessary.
 .
 Once this package is installed, simply point your preferred web
 browser to file:///usr/share/doc/yorick-doc/README.html .
