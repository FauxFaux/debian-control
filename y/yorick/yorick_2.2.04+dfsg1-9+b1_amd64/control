Description: interpreted language and scientific graphics
 Yorick is an interpreted programming language for:
  * scientific simulations or calculations
  * postprocessing or steering large simulation codes
  * interactive scientific graphics
  * reading, writing, and translating large files of numbers
 .
 The language features a compact syntax for many common array
 operations, so it processes large arrays of numbers very quickly and
 efficiently.  Superficially, yorick code resembles C code, but yorick
 variables are never explicitly declared and have a dynamic scoping
 similar to many Lisp dialects.  The yorick language is designed to be
 typed interactively at a keyboard, as well as stored in files for
 later use.
 .
 This package includes an emacs-based development environment, which
 you can launch by typing M-x yorick in emacs.
 .
 Many add-on packages and plug-ins are available for Yorick (the
 package names begin with "yorick-"). You may want to install the
 yorick-full metapackage which depends on the vast majority of them.
