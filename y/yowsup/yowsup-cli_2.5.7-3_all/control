Description: command line tool that acts as WhatsApp client
 WhatsApp Messenger is a cross-platform mobile messaging app which allows
 you to exchange messages, via Internet, without having to pay for SMS,
 using a mobile phone.
 .
 In addition to basic messaging, WhatsApp users can create groups, send
 each other unlimited images, video and audio media messages.
 .
 yowsup-cli is a command line program, based in python-yowsup library, that
 allows you to login and use the WhatsApp service, providing all capabilities
 of an official WhatsApp client, as encryption of messages. This program can
 be used for multiple purposes as e.g. to receive messages from network servers
 or appliances, notifying about issues, via direct command or by special agents
 (Zabbix, Nagios, iwatch, portsentry, etc.).
 .
 This package is a good example of the python-yowsup library implementation.
