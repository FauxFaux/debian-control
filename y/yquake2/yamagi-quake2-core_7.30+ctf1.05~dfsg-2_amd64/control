Description: enhanced version of id Software's Quake II - non-GUI part
 This is the Yamagi Quake II Server, an enhanced Version of id Software's
 Quake II. This code is based upon Icculus Quake II,
 which itself is built upon id Software's original code drop. Additional code
 and patches by many contributors were used.
 .
 This package contains files common to the client and the server, and a
 dedicated server engine is intended to be used via the wrapper script
 and init scripts in the quake2-server package.
