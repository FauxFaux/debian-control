Description: enhanced version of id Software's Quake II - client
 This is the Yamagi Quake II Client, an enhanced Version of id Software's
 Quake II. The main focus is single player, the gameplay and the graphics are
 unchanged, but many bugs were fixed. This code is based upon Icculus Quake II,
 which itself is built upon id Software's original code drop. Additional code
 and patches by many contributors were used.
 .
 This engine is intended to be used via the wrapper script and menu entries
 in the quake2 package.
