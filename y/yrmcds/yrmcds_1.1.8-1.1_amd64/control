Description: memcached compatible KVS with master/slave replication
 yrmcds is a memory object caching system with master/slave replication and
 server-side locking. Since its protocol is perfectly compatible with that of
 memcached, yrmcds can be used as a drop-in replacement for memcached.
 .
 A companion client library libyrmcds and a PHP extension are also available.
