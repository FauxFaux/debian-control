Description: two-factor password and YubiKey OTP PAM module
 This package provides the Yubico PAM module. It enables the use of
 two-factor authentication, with existing logins and passwords plus
 a YubiKey One-Time Password that is validated against an online
 validation service. The default is the free YubiCloud, but it is easy
 to set up a custom service.
 .
 A second mode of operation is available using the YubiKey's HMAC-SHA-1
 Challenge-Response functionality. This allows for offline validation
 using a YubiKey, for example on a laptop computer. However, this only
 works for local logins, not for instance SSH logins.
