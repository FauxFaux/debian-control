Description: support library for the Java-based parser generator jay
 This is a library that supports tracing and animation for a Java-based parser
 generated by jay. It produces one-line messages by default to standard output.
 The messages are designed to be filtered by a program such as grep. The class
 jay.yydebug.yyAnim provides an animation of the parsing process.
