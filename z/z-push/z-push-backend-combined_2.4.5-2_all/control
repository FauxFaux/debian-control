Description: open source implementation of the ActiveSync protocol - combine backends
 Z-Push is an implementation of the ActiveSync protocol which is used
 'over-the-air' for multi platform ActiveSync devices, including Windows
 Mobile, iPhone, Sony Ericsson and Nokia mobile devices. With Z-Push any
 groupware can be connected and synced with these devices.

 The combined backend allows you to use a combination from different other
