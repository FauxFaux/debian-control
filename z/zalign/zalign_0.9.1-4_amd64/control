Description: parallel local alignment of biological sequences
 zAlign is a local sequence aligner, especially intended for use with
 large biological DNA sequences, with more than 1Mbp (Millions of base
 pairs). It uses the Smith-Waterman exact algorithm with affine gap cost
 function to perform this task.
 .
 zAlign can be used both in distributed (clusters, for
 example) or standalone environments. Currently it has
 been tested on Linux and Sun Solaris, using both the MPICH
 (http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpi/mpich1/) and OpenMPI
 (http://www.open-mpi.org/) implementations. Ports for other Unix-like
 environments are highly considered.
