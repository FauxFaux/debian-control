Description: daemon process control library and tools for Unix-based systems
 `zdaemon` is a Python package which provides APIs for managing applications
 run as daemons. Its principal use to date has been to manage the application
 server and storage server daemons for Zope / ZEO, although it is not limited
 to running Python-based applications (for instance, it has been used to manage
 the 'spread' daemon).
