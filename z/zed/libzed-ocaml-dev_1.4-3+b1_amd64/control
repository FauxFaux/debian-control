Description: abstract engine for text edition in OCaml (development tools)
 Zed is an abstract engine for text edition. It can be used to
 write text editors, edition widgets, readlines, ...
 .
 Zed uses Camomile to fully support the Unicode specification, and
 implements an UTF-8 encoded string type with validation, and a rope
 datastructure to achieve efficient operations on large Unicode
 buffers. Zed also features a regular expression search on ropes.
 .
 To support efficient text edition capabilities, Zed provides macro
 recording and cursor management facilities.
 .
 This package contains the development stuff needed to use the
 zed library in your programs.
