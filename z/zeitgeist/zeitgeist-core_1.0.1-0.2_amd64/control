Description: event logging framework - engine
 Zeitgeist is a service which logs the user's activities and events (files
 opened, websites visited, conversations held with other people, etc.) and
 makes the relevant information available to other applications.
 .
 It serves as a comprehensive activity log and also makes it possible to
 determine relationships between items based on usage patterns.
 .
 This package contains the main daemon (in its new Vala implementation,
 codenamed "Bluebird"). It also includes the FTS (Full Text Search)
 extension.
