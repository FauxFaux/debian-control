Description: event logging framework - passive logging daemon
 Zeitgeist is a service which logs the user's activities and events (files
 opened, websites visited, conversations hold with other people, etc.) and
 makes the relevant information available to other applications.
 .
 It serves as a comprehensive activity log and also makes it possible to
 determine relationships between items based on usage patterns.
 .
 This package contains zeitgeist-datahub, a daemon which starts together with
 the main engine and inserts information collected from GtkRecentlyUsed, KDE's
 Recent Documents and several other sources into it.
