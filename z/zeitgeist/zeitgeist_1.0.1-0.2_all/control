Description: event logging framework
 Zeitgeist is a service which logs the user's activities and events (files
 opened, websites visited, conversations held with other people, etc.) and
 makes the relevant information available to other applications.
 .
 It serves as a comprehensive activity log and also makes it possible to
 determine relationships between items based on usage patterns.
 .
 This metapackage depends on the Zeitgeist engine and a set of packages
 (such as data providers) commonly used together with it.
