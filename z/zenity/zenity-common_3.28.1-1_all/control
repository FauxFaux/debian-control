Description: Display graphical dialog boxes from shell scripts (common files)
 Zenity allows you to display GTK+ dialogs from shell scripts; it is a
 rewrite of the `gdialog' command from GNOME 1.
 .
 Zenity includes a gdialog wrapper script so that it can be used with
 legacy scripts.
 .
 This package contains architecture independent files.
