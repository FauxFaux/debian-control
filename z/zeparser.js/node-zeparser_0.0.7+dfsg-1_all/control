Description: Javascript code parser module for Node.js
 Parse Javascript code elements with Node.js. The parser has two modes
 for parsing: simple and extended.
 .
 The simple mode is mainly for just parsing and returning the streams and a
 simple parse tree. There's not so much meta information here and this
 mode is mainly built for speed.
 .
 The extended mode has everything required for Zeon to do its job.
 .
 This package provides ZeParser as a Node.js module.
