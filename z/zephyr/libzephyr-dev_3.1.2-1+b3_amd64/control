Description: Project Athena's notification service - development files
 Zephyr is derived from the original Project Athena 'Instant Message' system
 and allows users to send messages to other users or to groups of users.
 Users can view incoming Zephyr messages as windowgrams (transient X
 windows) or as text on a terminal.
 .
 This package provides development libraries and files, which are
 needed to compile alternative Zephyr clients.
