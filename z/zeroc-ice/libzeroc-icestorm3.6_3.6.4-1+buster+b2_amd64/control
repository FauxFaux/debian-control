Description: IceStorm publish-subscribe event distribution service
 This package contains the IceStorm publish-subscribe event distribution
 service.
 .
 IceStorm helps you create push applications. Your Ice client (the publisher)
 sends a request to a topic managed by IceStorm, and IceStorm delivers this
 request to all the subscribers (Ice objects) that you registered with this
 topic.
 .
 Ice is a comprehensive RPC framework that helps you network your software
 with minimal effort. Ice takes care of all interactions with low-level
 network programming interfaces and allows you to focus your efforts on
 your application logic.
