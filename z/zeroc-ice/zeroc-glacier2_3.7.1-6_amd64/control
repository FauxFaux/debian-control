Description: Glacier2 router
 This package contains the Glacier2 router. A Glacier2 router allows you to
 securely route Ice communications across networks, such as the public Internet
 and a private network behind a firewall. With Glacier2, you only need to open
 one port in your firewall to make multiple back-end Ice servers reachable by
 remote Ice clients on the Internet.
 .
 Ice is a comprehensive RPC framework that helps you network your software
 with minimal effort. Ice takes care of all interactions with low-level
 network programming interfaces and allows you to focus your efforts on
 your application logic.
