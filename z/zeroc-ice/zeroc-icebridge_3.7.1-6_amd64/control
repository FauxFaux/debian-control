 This package contains the Ice bridge. The Ice bridge allows you to bridge
 connections securely between one or multiple clients and a server. It
 relays requests from clients to a target server and makes every effort
 to be as transparent as possible.

 network programming interfaces and allows you to focus your efforts on
 your application logic.
