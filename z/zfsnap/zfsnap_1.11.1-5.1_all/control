Description: Automatic snapshot creation and removal for ZFS
 zfSnap is a simple sh script to make rolling zfs snapshots with cron. The main
 advantage of zfSnap is it's written in 100% pure /bin/sh so it doesn't require
 any additional software to run.
 .
 zfSnap keeps all information about snapshot in snapshot name.
 .
 zfs snapshot names are in the format of Timestamp--TimeToLive.
 .
 Timestamp includes the date and time when the snapshot was created and
 TimeToLive (TTL) is the amount of time for the snapshot to stay alive before
 it's ready for deletion.
