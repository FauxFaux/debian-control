Description: Headers and static libraries for zh-autoconvert
 AutoConvert is an intelligent Chinese Encoding converter. It uses
 builtin functions to judge the type of the input fileâ€™s Chinese
 Encoding (such as GB/Big5/HZ), then converts the input file to any
 type of Chinese Encoding you want. You can use autoconvert to handle
 incoming mail, automatically converting messages to the Chinese
 Encoding you want.  It can alse handle Unicode (UTF-16)/UTF-7/UTF-8 now.
 .
 This package contains the development files (symlinks, headers, and object
 files) needed to compile and link programs which use the zh-autoconvert
 libhz library.
