Description: graphical text editor based on wiki technologies
 Zim is a graphical text editor used to maintain a collection of wiki pages.
 .
 Each page can contain links to other pages, simple formatting and inline
 images. Pages are stored in a folder structure, like in an outliner, and can
 have attachments. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a nonexistent
 page.
 .
 All data is stored in plain text files with wiki formatting. Various
 plugins provide additional functionality, like a task list manager, an
 equation editor, a tray icon, and support for version control.
 .
 Zim can be used to:
  * Keep an archive of notes
  * Take notes during meetings or lectures
  * Organize task lists
  * Draft blog entries and emails
  * Do brainstorming
