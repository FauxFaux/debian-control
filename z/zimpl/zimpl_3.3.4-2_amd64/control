Description: mathematical modeling language for optimization problems
 Zimpl allows the specification of certain optimization problems - linear
 programs (LPs) and mixed integer programs (MIPs) - in a high-level
 description language. These descriptions can be converted into the
 LP or MPS file formats which are understood by LP and MIP solvers.
