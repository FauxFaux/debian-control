Description: development files for the zinnia library
 Zinnia provides a simple, customizable, and portable dynamic OCR
 system for hand-written input, based on Support Vector Machines.
 .
 Zinnia simply receives user pen strokes as coordinate data and outputs
 the best matching characters sorted by SVM confidence. To maintain
 portability, it has no rendering functionality. In addition to
 recognition, Zinnia provides a training module capable of creating
 highly efficient handwriting recognition models.
 .
 This package is needed to compile programs against libzinnia0,
 as only it includes the header files and static libraries (optionally)
 needed for compiling.
