Description: compressing HTTP proxy server
 Ziproxy is a forwarding, non-caching and compressing HTTP proxy server.
 Basically it squeezes images by converting them to lower quality JPEGs
 and compresses (gzip) HTML and other text-like data. It also provides
 other features such as: HTML/JS/CSS optimization, preemptive hostname
 resolution, transparent proxying, IP ToS marking (QoS), Ad-Blocker,
 detailed logging and more.
 .
 Ziproxy may be installed in a number of different ways. Most common
 setup modes:
  1) As a remote proxy (by far, the most commonly used setup)
     Ziproxy accesses the remote www servers through a fast link,
     compresses the data, then send it to the client through a slow link.
     In such setups there's no additional software required by the client,
     Ziproxy acts much as a common network proxy.
  2) As a local and remote proxy
     Similar to setup #1, except that the client also runs its instance of
     Ziproxy. Although Ziproxy does not require a Ziproxy-specific client,
     there are circumstances where is desired to run Ziproxy-as-a-client:
       * Client does not support JPEG 2000.
       * Client supports JPEG 2000 but it is buggy and/or slow.
       * Client does not support gzip.
       * Need to support both JPEG 2000 and standard JPEG at the same proxy.
