Description: C++ library for resampling audio signals
 Zita resampler is a C++ library for resampling audio signals. It is
 designed to be used within a real-time processing context, to be
 fast, and to provide high-quality sample rate conversion.
 .
 The library operates on signals represented in single-precision
 floating point format. For multichannel operation both the input and
 output signals are assumed to be stored as interleaved samples.
 .
 The API allows a trade-off between quality and CPU load. For the
 latter a range of approximately 1:6 is available. Even at the
 highest quality setting libzita-resampler will be faster than most
 similar libraries, e.g. libsamplerate.
 .
 This package contains the shared library for libzita-resampler.
