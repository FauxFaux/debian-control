Description: pro-audio reverb effect
 REV1 is a reworked version of the reverb originally developed for Aeolus.
 Its character is more 'hall' than 'plate', but it can be used on a wide
 variety of instruments or voices. It is not a spatialiser - the early
 reflections are different for the L and R inputs, but do not correspond
 to any real room. They have been tuned to match left and right sources to
 some extent.
 .
 In Stereo mode a dry/wet mix control is provided, so it can be used either
 as an insert or in send/return mode. For mono just connect one of the
 two channels.
 .
 In Ambisonic mode (selected by the -B command line option) the only option
 is the send/return mode.
