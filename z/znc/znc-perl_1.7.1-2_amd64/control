Description: advanced modular IRC bouncer (Perl extension)
 znc is an IRC proxy. It runs as a daemon and connects to IRC server,
 then allows you to connect from a workstation and work as the user that
 is logged in to the IRC server. After you disconnect, it maintains the
 connection to the server. It acts like any normal IRC server, so you can
 use any IRC client to connect to it.
 .
 Some of its features include support for multiple users, multiple clients,
 and multiple IRC servers; playback buffers to catch up with what happened
 while you were detached, SSL encryption, DCC proxying, and a plugin
 interface with many plugins supporting other features.
 .
 This package contains the znc Perl extension.
