Description: Fork of pickle module for uniform serialization between Python 2 and 3 (Py2)
 This package forks both Python 2.7's pickle and cPickle modules for ZODB,
 adding support for the protocol 3 opcodes. It also provides a new
 subclass of bytes, zodbpickle.binary, which Python2 applications can use to
 pickle binary values such that they will be unpickled as bytes under Python 3.
