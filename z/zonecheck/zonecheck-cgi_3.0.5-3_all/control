Description: DNS configuration checker (web interface)
 DNS is a critical resource for every network application, so it is
 quite important to ensure that a zone or domain name is correctly
 configured in the DNS.
 .
 ZoneCheck is intended to help solving misconfigurations or
 inconsistencies usually revealed by an increase in the latency of the
 application, up to the output of unexpected/inconsistant results.
 .
 This package is the CGI version, for the Web.
