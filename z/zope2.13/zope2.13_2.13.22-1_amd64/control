Description: Open Source Web Application Server
 Zope is an open source web application server primarily written in
 the Python programming language. It features a transactional object
 database which can store not only content and custom data, but also
 dynamic HTML templates, scripts, a search engine, and relational
 database (RDBMS) connections and code.
 .
 It features a strong through-the-web development model, allowing you
 to update your web site from anywhere in the world. To allow for
 this, Zope also features a tightly integrated security model. Built
 around the concept of "safe delegation of control", Zope's security
 architecture also allows you to turn control over parts of a web site
 to other organizations or individuals.
 .
 This package contains the framework and libraries needed to run your
 own Zope 2.13 instance.
