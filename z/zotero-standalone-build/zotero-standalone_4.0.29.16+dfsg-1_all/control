Description: organize and share your research sources
 Zotero helps you collect, manage, and cite your research sources.
 .
 Zotero allows you to store your libraries online, so that they can be
 accessed from any computer. Your online collections can also be shared with
 other Zotero users, letting you collaboratively create bibliographies and
 research notes. It can automatically gather bibliographic information about
 resources available in hundreds of databases, library catalogs and the web.
 .
 This package contains the standalone version of Zotero which does not
 run within the Firefox browser (though it still uses its engine).
