Description: utilities for working with zram
 zram is a Linux kernel module that allows you to set up compressed
 filesystems in RAM.
 .
 zram-tools uses this module to set up compressed swap space.
 This is useful on systems with low memory or servers
 running a large amount of services with data that's easily swappable
 but that you may wish to swap back fast without sacrificing disk
 bandwidth.
 .
 By default it allocates 100MB of RAM, you can configure this in
 /etc/default/zramswap.conf
