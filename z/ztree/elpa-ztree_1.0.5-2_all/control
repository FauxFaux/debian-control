Description: text mode directory tree
 ztree is a project dedicated to implementation of several text-tree
 applications inside GNU Emacs. It consists of 2 subprojects: ztree-diff and
 ztree-dir.
 .
 ztree-diff is a directory-diff tool for Emacs inspired by commercial tools
 like Beyond Compare or Araxis Merge. It supports showing the difference
 between two directories; calling Ediff for not matching files, copying
 between directories, deleting file/directories, hiding/showing equal
 files/directories.
 .
 ztree-dir is a simple text-mode directory tree for Emacs.
