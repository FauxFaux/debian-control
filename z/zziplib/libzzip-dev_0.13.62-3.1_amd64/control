Description: library providing read access on ZIP-archives - development
 The zziplib library is intentionally lightweight, it offers the ability
 to easily extract data from files archived in a single zip file.
 Applications can bundle files into a single zip archive and access them.
 The implementation is based only on the (free) subset of compression
 with the zlib algorithm which is actually used by the zip/unzip tools.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static library needed to
 compile applications that use zziplib.
